This harvest will utilize the SciTech API.

See https://www.osti.gov/home/sites/www.osti.gov.home/files/SciTechXMLDataServices.pdf

All of the unlimited classification data is out there. No real limits to pulling content via the API. They might be interested in using the push protocol to send us information. Acceptable use policy is 5000 full text, 100,000 byte-range requests. It does not sound to Lance like anything we plan to do will exceed their limits, especially since we are not pulling full text.

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Lance Vowell on 6/6/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Not sure.
