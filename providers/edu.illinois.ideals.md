University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IDEALS
====

The content in the IDEALS at UIUC is primarily research and scholarship of faculty, staff, and students. Faculty, staff, and graduate students can deposit their research and scholarshipÑunpublished and, in many cases, publishedÑdirectly into IDEALS. Departments can use IDEALS to distribute their working papers, technical reports, or other research material. All theses and dissertations deposited from Fall 2010 onward are available in IDEALS.

_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

UIUC has a longstanding practice of digitizing older content, assuming SHARE is not interested in those. ETDs are included.
 
Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Lisa Schiff on 6/24/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

No.

For some of our metadata we can't license under CC license, the abstracts in particular are created by students and we do not have agreement from depositors that the metadata.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

Only an privacy issue with ETD FERPA, and those would not appear in the OAI-PMH feed.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

Where we would have an issue is in our policy about dissemination of content (as many means as possible), if we were to reshare.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)?_

Our policy that outlines that our metadata will be harvested and disseminated is here:
 
https://services.ideals.illinois.edu/wiki/bin/view/IDEALS/AccessUsePolicy

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Some of the metadata is coming from MARC records that would be CC zero able, but other data an issue.

Two challenges, one with abstracts that are pretty substantive. Then also material that is a preprint and will be covered. Good case to CC Zero everything except the abstract and keywords. Will investigate.
