The content in the California Digital Library (CDL) eScholarship system is primarily original scholarly works (articles, monographs, etc.), postprints (previously published articles), grey literature (e.g. working papers) and Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). Also a small amount of streaming media and images, both as supplemental material and as the primary object.

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Lisa Schiff on 6/24/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

No. It depends on the CC license you choose. Abstracts probably can’t be CC Zero.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)?_

We don’t have one (at the moment).

_Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it?_

N/A

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Yes, except the abstracts.  We can share the abstracts, we just can’t allow the application of a CC Zero license to them.
