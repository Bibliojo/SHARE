Metadata Sharing Questions

Responses provided by John Chodacki on 6/24/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

No. Though abstracts can be under copyright they may be included per the PLOS CC-BY license.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

Not as long as the terms of the CC-BY license are honored.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

PLOS policy is CC-BY or better. Conveyance of metadata includes the attribution of authors required by CC-BY.
