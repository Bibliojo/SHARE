Note that the Wayne State repository may include material that does not qualify as research output. We need to heed the list of "series names" provided by Wayne State in order to only harvest material of a research nature.

This will be an OAI-PMH harvest. This is a bepress institution and all the OAI feeds are provided by bepress.

Use the template:

    http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/do/oai/?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=publication:[series_name]

The identifiers below comprise series (corresponding to [series_name] above) that could see new research outputs. You'd need to key off the dc:date field in some way to determine new research outputs vs. backfile loads or deposits of older materials, since this is an institutional repository.

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Joshua Neds-Fox on 7/2/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

No, the OAI-PMH service implies permission. You are explicitly permitted to gather data via OAI-PMH (or, if developed, an API to be specified) from our repositor(ies).

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No. See above.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

Please share the data you gather in service of the SHARE notification system.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

The metadata is not explicitly licensed, but consider this a non-exclusive license to archive, operate on, and distribute metadata harvested as described above.
