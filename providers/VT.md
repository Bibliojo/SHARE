The OAI-PMH base URI is:

http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/oai/request

The ETD set is rather active and is getting new items almost every day, which I guess would be a good candidate for SHARE testing. 

	<set>
	<setSpec>com_10919_5534</setSpec>
	<setName>ETDs: Virginia Tech Electronic Theses and Dissertations</setName>
	</set>

VTechWorks as a whole is our IR, so it publishes all types of research outputs from Virginia Tech.

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Zhiwu Xie on 7/1/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

Metadata gathering does NOT violate vtechworks' terms of service.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

Metadata gathering does NOT violate vtechworks' privacy policy.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

Sharing metadata does NOT violate vtechworks' policies.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Currently the metadata are not licensed. We may license them to CC Zero in the near future.
