To see all the sets available use:

The template for requests would be:

    http://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-oai/request?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=publication:[series_name]

_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

No need, include everything. The only things that should not be included are not public or provided by the OAI feed either.
 
Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Ann Lally on 9/23/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?_

No.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

No plans to my knowledge. We did sign a CC Zero with DPLA for the Digital Collections.
