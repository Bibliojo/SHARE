[DSpace@MIT](http://dspace.mit.edu) is a growing collection of MIT’s research that includes peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, working papers, theses and more. There are a few collections in DSpace that would not be considered research, so a list of sets to harvest will be provided.

_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

Richard will provide a list of the sets to include.
 
Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Richard Rogers, Armand Doucette, and Steve Gass on 9/19/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No. We have a deposit license that says the libraries can redistribute and transform at will.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?_

On content some. On metadata no.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

On the roadmap of what’s hopeful. We are taking a broader look at some of these licensing issues.
