This will be an OAI-PMH harvest. This is a bepress institution and all the OAI feeds are provided by bepress. ([Wayne State](WayneState.md) is another bepress example.)

The OAI-PMH interface is here:
 
    http://repository.upenn.edu/do/oai/

To see all the sets available use:

    http://repository.upenn.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListSets&metadataPrefix=dcq

The template for requests would be:

    http://repository.upenn.edu/do/oai/?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=publication:[series_name]
 
_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

This collection is entirely scholarly, so SHARE can harvest anything emerging from it.
 
Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Shawn Martin on 9/22/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?_

Generally no.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

There has been talk of that. A few isolated cases where an author has used a CC license. We would discourage NC type licenses that might cause SHARE problems.
