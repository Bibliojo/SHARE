Valparaiso University
====

[ValpoScholar](http://scholar.valpo.edu) reflects the collaborative nature of the intellectual, creative, and scholarly culture of Valparaiso. ValpoScholar serves as the central exchange for outstanding scholarship and creative work from faculty and students, as well as University records, and campus history. Since this is not exlusively research output, we will have to use a list of "series" to determine what to include in SHARE.

This will be an OAI-PMH harvest. This is a bepress institution and all the OAI feeds are provided by bepress. ([Wayne State](WayneState.md) is another bepress example.)

The OAI-PMH interface is here:
 
    http://scholar.valpo.edu/do/oai/

To see all the sets available use:

    http://scholar.valpo.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListSets

To retrieve a specific set use:

    http://scholar.valpo.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=dcq&set=publication:cc_fac_pub

The template for requests would be:

    http://scholar.valpo.edu/do/oai/?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=publication:[series_name]
 
_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository (as distinct from cultural heritage materials). Often this is a list of OAI-PMH "sets" or "series" encompassing research output that we should harvest from your repository._

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Jonathan Bull on 9/30/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No, not at all. We don't have any privacy policy, if we put data in the repository we want it to be discoverable. Authors submit because they want to be seen. Certain student research might be excluded.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No. I've been approached by a couple research groups that want managed research services.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?_

No.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Metadata is openly available. We could easily slap one on our homepage. We would consider it to be similar to a creative commons public domain license. Not concerned with abstracts or keywords. We ask our authors to specify a citation and all related metadata. Most of our authors give us blanket permission.
