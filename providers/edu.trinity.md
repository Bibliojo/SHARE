Trinity University
====

The content of the [Digital Commons @ Trinity](http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu) includes research and scholarly output selected and deposited by the individual university departments and centers on campus. However, it also includes some cultural heritage and administrative content, so Trinity will provide a list of appropriate series.

This will be an OAI-PMH harvest. This is a bepress institution and all the OAI feeds are provided by bepress. ([Wayne State](WayneState.md) is another bepress example.)

The OAI-PMH interface is here:
 
    http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/do/oai/

To see all the sets available use:

    http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListSets

To retrieve a specific set use:

    http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=dcq&set=publication:qebcr_sw_mn

The template for requests would be:

    http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/do/oai/?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=publication:[series_name]
 
_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

Should student work be included? Yes, for now. Since the commons at Trinity includes cultural heritage and administrative items, Jane provided a list of the appropriate "series" for the notification service (10/9), very similar to the [Wayne State](WayneState.md) list.

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Jane Costanze on 9/29/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?

No. On some of our articles have cc licenses. We place those license URLs in the metadata. But no license on the metadata itself.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the metadata?_

No, we have not, but that brings me back to OCLC's copyright issues.
