The Digital Collections repository is a service that provides free and open access to the scholarship and creative works produced and owned by the Texas State University community. In addition to research output, the collections do include some campus resources and cultural heritage materials, so some care will have to be taken to harvest only the communities and collections specified by Todd below.

This will be an OAI-PMH harvest. This is a DSpace repository.

The OAI-PMH interface is here:
 
    https://digital.library.txstate.edu/oai/request

To see all the sets available use:

    http://digital.library.txstate.edu/oai/request?verb=ListSets

To retrieve a specific set use:

    http://digital.library.txstate.edu/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&set=com_10877_2

The template for requests would be:

    http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/do/oai/?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=[set_identifier]
 
_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

Sets are present for both communities (`com_10877_2`) and for collections (`col_10877_78`). Todd provided a list of identifiers on 10/2/2014.

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Todd Peters on 9/23/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No. We are already doing OAI-PMH feeds into our discovery and Google.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?_

No.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

No, we have not discussed licensing our metadata.
