This harvest will utilize the CrossRef API.

You don't need a member account. Make sure you are using the REST API documented here:

    http://api.crossref.org

You might also be interested in this description of using the API:

Also note that you can simply query the metadata for any DOI using content negotiation. As per:

Metadata Sharing Questions

Responses provided by Geoffrey Builder on 6/19/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service? If so, are we granted explicit, written rights to gather data?_

No. it does not violate our terms of service.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy? If so, are we granted explicit, written rights to gather data?_

No. It does not violate our privacy policy.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy? If so, are we granted explicit, written license to share/re-license the metadata?_

N/A

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

We consider the metadata to be facts. Therefor a license is not applicable. See our Free services T&Cs below. Note that the free API can be throttled, etc. if we get hammered by millions of users or something. This hasn't happened yet, but it could. SHARE may eventually want to get a guaranteed SLA for the API. If so, there may be charges for the SLA- not the data.. The charges simply cover the extra resources we need to guarantee performance by adding separately scaled instances, etc. Also note that with an SLA the licensing/privacy issues will *not* change.

CrossRef T&Cs for free services
----

1. OWNERSHIP. CrossRef asserts no claims of ownership to individual items of bibliographic metadata and associated Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) acquired through the use of the CrossRef Free Services. Individual items of bibliographic metadata and associated DOIs may be cached and incorporated into the user's content and systems.

2. LIMITATIONS. The CrossRef Free Services are offered for the purpose of providing public access to individual items of metadata as distinguished from bulk downloads or deliveries of metadata. CrossRef reserves the right to suspend the CrossRef Free Services and to suspend any individual users' ability to access the CrossRef Free Services at any time in its sole discretion.  CrossRef may set and enforce usage limitations for the CrossRef Free Services, and may track use of the CrossRef Free Services by users to determine compliance with such usage limitations.

3. CROSSREF PAID SERVICES. CrossRef offers other services to users on a paid, contractual basis. To receive bulk deliveries, to perform bulk queries, or to harvest bibliographic metadata and DOI numbers, or to have better system response times, or to integrate the bibliographic metadata and DOI numbers into a commercial product or service, then the user should review the information about these other services available at the CrossRef website http://www.crossref.org.

4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE CROSSREF FREE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL DOI NUMBERS AND METADATA, ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
