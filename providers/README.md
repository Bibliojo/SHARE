This directory contains documentation about the content providers from which we are harvesting research release events for the SHARE Notification Service. These are our sources. Please remember that these are SHARE notes and do not necessarily accurately reflect the policy of these institutions.

We use [reverse domain name notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation) to name these provider documents, which are (for the most part) based on [template.md](template.md). If a single organization has more than one system reporting to the SHARE Notification Service under the same domain, we can distinguish the two after the basic reverse domain. For example, the Department of Energy's Office of Science and Technical Information reports from both the SciTech (http://www.osti.gov/scitech/) and Pages (http://www.osti.gov/pages/) systems. These get the file names `gov.osti.scitech.md` and `gov.osti.pages.md` in this directory.
