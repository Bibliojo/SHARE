Southern Illinois University Carbondale
====

The content of the OpenSIUC is primarily research, though there are some collections that are of a campus records nature. Since the material types are varied, we will have to only harvest from specific sets of records, rather than capture the whole repository. SIU Carbondale will provide a list of "series names" from which we should harvest.

Jonathan Nabe of SIU Carbondale, regarding content

Robert Allen at bepress, regarding issues with the OAI feed itself

This will be an OAI-PMH harvest. This is a bepress institution and all the OAI feeds are provided by bepress. ([Wayne State](WayneState.md) is another bepress example.)

The OAI-PMH interface is here:
 
    http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/do/oai/

To see all the sets available use:

    http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListSets&metadataPrefix=dcq

To retrieve a specific set use:

    http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=dcq&set=publication:ad_pubs

The template for requests would be:

    http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/do/oai/?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=publication:[series_name]
     
_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

Jonathan provided a list of sets to retrieve on 9/22/14. This is a list very similar to the [Wayne State](WayneState.md) list.

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Jonathan Nabe on 9/19/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_


No.


_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_


No.


_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_


No.



_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?


No.


_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_


No.
