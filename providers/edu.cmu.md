The content of the [Research Showcase @ CMU](http://repository.cmu.edu) is Carnegie Mellon University’s institutional repository, preserving and providing online open access to work produced by CMU faculty and students. Journal articles, conference papers and presentations, books and book chapters, technical reports, Ph.D. dissertations, Master's theses, and selected undergraduate student works authored by members of the Carnegie Mellon community are available through the repository. Since the whole repository is comprised of research and scholarship, we can harvest it all for research release event reports.

This will be an OAI-PMH harvest. This is a bepress institution and all the OAI feeds are provided by bepress. ([Wayne State](WayneState.md) is another bepress example.)

The OAI-PMH interface is here:
 
    http://repository.cmu.edu/do/oai/

To see all the sets available use:

    http://repository.cmu.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListSets

To retrieve a specific set use:

    http://repository.cmu.edu/do/oai/?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=dcq&set=publication:bme

The template for requests would be:

    http://repository.cmu.edu/do/oai/?verb=[OAI-PHMVerb]&metadataPrefix=[oai_dc|qualified-dublin-core]&set=publication:[series_name]
 
_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

Basically what’s in the IR is scholarly research. Special collections and other material is in a different system. We can consider anything in this repository suitable for SHARE's mission.
 
Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Katie Behrman on 10/1/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?

No. On some of our articles have cc licenses. We place those license URLs in the metadata. But no license on the metadata itself.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the metadata?_

No, we have not, but that brings me back to OCLC's copyright issues.
