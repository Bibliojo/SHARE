_Provide any distinguishing characteristics of research outputs in your repository or sets that represent research outputs (as distinct from cultural heritage materials)._

The repository is weighted toward scholarship, but it does have student works, cultural heritage, and administrative information. Colleen provided the following list of series to be included in the notification service:

Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Colleen and Ladd on 9/29/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your terms of service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your privacy policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing the metadata we gather from you violate your policies?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (for example, CC Zero)?

No.

_If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Don’t currently, but that is something we are considering. Within the next couple months.
