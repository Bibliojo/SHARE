Metadata Sharing Questions
----

Responses provided by Lance Vowell on 6/6/2014 in regard to [SciTech](DOEnergy.md) but should be relvant to DOE PAGES as well.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Not sure.
