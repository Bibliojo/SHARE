[DMPTool](https://dmp.cdlib.org) is used by roughly 800 institutions and 10,000 users to generate data management plans. Once grants have been awarded, researchers are encouraged to make their DMP public. Public DMPs are a legitimate research release event, giving a very early warning of research to be done and intentions around data set preparation and release. While the plans are fuzzy enough to make teasing out individual promises about data sets difficult, even the report of the full DMP can be helpful as a notification.

Metadata Sharing Questions

Responses provided by Trisha Cruse and Carly Strasser on 7/22/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_


No.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.


_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

CC Zero on the way. Public DMPs are not quite documented as such right now, but will be.
