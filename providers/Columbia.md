This will be an OAI-PMH harvest.

The OAI interface for Academic Commons is available at:

http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/oai

In general the Academic Commons is research output. So you can take it all. But these include posters, presentations, and the like. They do have a "type" that would distinguish between the these kinds of items. You would see these types in our interface, but not exporting them via OAI-PMH. In OAI-PMH the "resource type" will be mostly "text", though this may become more semantically rich in a few months.

Metadata Sharing Questions

Responses provided by Simone Sacchi on 6/24/2014.

_The SHARE Notification Service will gather together research release event reports from the metadata you provide. Since we will be reusing your metadata and then retransmitting it to others as notifications, we need to be sure the rights to use that metadata are not encumbered._

_Does metadata gathering violate your Terms of Service?_

No. Though abstract can be under copyright and may or may not be an issue.

_Does metadata gathering violate your Privacy Policy?_

No.

_Does our sharing your metadata violate your Privacy Policy?_

Donï¿½t think so, but want to double check.

_What is the license of the metadata (e.g., CC Zero)? Does that license extend to those beyond the group that gathered it? If unlicensed, will you explicitly license the content?_

Aiming for CC0, but not explicit yet.
