<dc:description>This research created an interactive, multimedia, food safety education program on CD/ROM for fourth through sixth grade school children.  The project was divided into three stages: 1) a survey to assess children's needs, 2) program development, and 3) Beta-testing the program with content experts and the targeted audience. &#xd;
A needs assessment survey was administered to children, 9 to 12 years of age, who were members of a 4-H, Boys and Girls Clubs, or after school program.  The survey collected demographic data, food handling frequencies/practices, handwashing habits, and computer usage/media preferences.  Children were found to be active in food handling/preparation and stated they knew the definition of food safety.  Many, however, were unsure of the meaning of cross-contamination, how to use a thermometer, and were inconsistent with safe handwashing practices.  Almost 92% of respondents reported using the computer daily, weekly, or monthly and 91% liked using the computer for learning. &#xd;
	To facilitate design of the food safety education program, current food safety education programs were reviewed.  At the time, there were limited numbers of programs directed at children and even fewer computer-based. &#xd;
	A multimedia specialist assisted in the creation of the food safety education program on CD/ROM titled, "Kid Chef and the Clean Kitchen Crew."  The program was divided into four chapters: 1) food safety and foodborne illness, 2) handwashing importance and handwashing techniques, 3) foodborne &#xd;
pathogens, and 4) food safety practices from purchase to cooking to serving.  Interactive and multimedia components were used throughout the program. &#xd;
Beta-testing with experts from food safety, multimedia, education, extension, and technology ensured that the program was factual and appropriate for fourth through sixth grade students.  Additional Beta-testing with ten children in the targeted age group illustrated acceptance, ease of understanding, and navigation.   Changes were made prior to each subsequent critique.  &#xd;
The reviewers and target audience indicated the CD format was acceptable for presenting food safety education.  Recommendations included increasing the amount of animation, video clips, questions, and translation into Spanish.  It is further suggested that the program be tested for effectiveness via a pre/post test design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Three independent panels evaluated a total of 22 scents. Two panels were highly trained in sensory analysis techniques and performed descriptive analysis of the fragrances. In the third panel, 318 untrained respondents completed demographic questionnaires, personality tests, and surveys on fragrance attitudes and behaviors. They also evaluated the 22 scents: their perceptions of the fragrances’ sensory qualities and hedonic value were recorded, as well as the images and personalities they associated with these particular fragrances. &#xd;
Some methodological issues were tested, emphasizing the need for standardized procedures and consistency in fragrance evaluation.  The use of consistent methodology in the preparation of fragrance samples is critical to accurately assess fragrance sensory properties.  Additionally, consistent use of validated questionnaires constitutes an important strength for the fragrance industry: to better understand consumers, develop marketing strategies, and improve customers’ guidance and education.  &#xd;
The interplay of individual differences with fragrance perception, whether from an attitudinal, sensorial, hedonic, or associative standpoint, appears complex.  From a perceptual standpoint, sensory profiles generated by trained panels were representative of consumers’ perceptions, yet trained panelists discriminated better among fragrances and provided more detailed and actionable profiles.  From an attitudinal and behavioral standpoint, demographic and psychological differences explained independent aspects of motivations and attitudes toward fragrances, but were not sufficient to fully account for the variability in attitudinal and behavioral patterns.  Lastly, in terms of fragrance perception and image and personality associations, the combination of both intrinsic sensory characteristics and fragrance hedonic value was necessary to understand patterns of image and personality traits associated with fragrances. Interestingly, most findings were consistent even when individual differences in liking patterns for fragrances were taken into account. However, some specific dimensions, such as mood associations were preferred by clusters of respondents and depended upon individual differences.&#xd;
Although more research is needed to better understand the interrelationships among individual differences and all aspects of fragrance perception in real-life settings, this research provided valuable insights into these phenomena – insights that have direct implications, including understanding consumer perceptual processes, assessing potential influences of fragrances on social interactions, and providing strategic planning for marketing and advertising of personal fragrances.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study proposed and tested a theoretical model of service recovery consisting of antecedents and consequences of service recovery satisfaction.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This study further tested recovery paradox effects and investigated the effects of situational and attributional factors in the evaluation of service recovery efforts and consequent overall satisfaction and behavioral intentions.  &#xd;
The study employed scenario experimentation with three dimensions of justice manipulated at two levels each (2x2x2 between-groups factorial design).  Postage paid, self-addressed envelopes and questionnaires (600 copies) were distributed.  Participants represented 15 religious and community service groups.  All respondents were regular casual restaurant customers.  Of 308 surveys returned, 286 cases were used for data analysis.  In study 1, the proposed relationships were tested using the structural equation modeling.  In study 2, multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of covariance tests were employed to test proposed hypotheses.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The three dimensions of justice had positive effects on recovery satisfaction.  Recovery satisfaction had a significant positive effect on customers’ trust.  Trust in service providers had positive effect on commitment and overall satisfaction.  Commitment had positive effects on overall satisfaction and behavioral intentions.  This study indicated that, although a service failure might negatively affect customers’ relationship with the service provider, effective service recovery reinforced attitudinal and behavioral outcomes.  The results of this study emphasized that service recovery efforts should be viewed not only as a strategy to recover customers’ immediate satisfaction but also as a relationship tool to provide customers confidence that ongoing relationships are beneficial to them.  &#xd;
This study did not find recovery paradox in the experimental scenarios.  The magnitude of service failure had significant negative effects on perceived justice and recovery satisfaction.  Customers’ rating of stability causation had significant negative effects on overall satisfaction, revisit intention, and word-of-mouth intention.  The study findings indicated that positive recovery efforts could reinstate customers’ satisfaction and behavioral intentions up to those of pre-failure.  Restaurant managers and their employees need to provide extra efforts to restore the customers’ perceived losses in serious failure situations.  Service providers should reduce systematic occurrences of service failure so customer will not develop stability perception.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this research and development study was to design, develop, evaluate and revise reusable online learning resources based on the principles of learning objects that would support instructional design students' learning and performance in the context of ATC in Saudi Arabia.&#xd;
Using a research and development model (Borg and Gall, 1989), Instructional Design reusable online learning resources (ID-RORs) were iteratively and collaboratively developed and revised based on feedback gathered through formative evaluation. Between each round of qualitative formative evaluation, the ID-RORs were revised based on analysis of the data. Seven main research and development phases were carried out: research and information collecting, a needs assessment, prototype development, expert evaluations, redesign, target user evaluations and redesign.  &#xd;
 The formative evaluation of ID-RORs consisted of three phases. The first evaluation group was comprised of four experts. The purpose of this evaluation was to conduct a needs assessment. The second phase, which used feedback from two experts and two instructional design teachers, was the expert evaluation. The purpose of this evaluation was to examine the validity of the ID-RORs. The third phase, based on feedback from 11 students, was the user evaluation. The purpose of this evaluation was to examine the practicality of the ID-RORs. &#xd;
The overall results of the needs assessment evaluation showed that the ID-RORs prototype met an important need at ATC. The overall result of the expert evaluation showed that the ID-RORs prototype were valid for the context of ATC. Finally, the result of target user evaluation showed that the ID-RORs as revised with expert and user input were practical for the intended target users. Based on the results of this R &amp; D study, it was concluded that the answer to the research question is yes, it is possible to develop the ID-RORs to meet the specifications of the needs assessment. The characteristics of ID-RORs are very similar to the characteristics of successful (valid and practical) reusable online resources. The final version of the ID-RORs were found to be needed, valid and practical, in the context of ATC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Many studies are performed on units that cannot be replicated due to cost or other restrictions.&#xd;
There often is an abundance of subsampling to estimate the within unit component of&#xd;
variance, but what is needed for statistical tests is an estimate of the between unit component&#xd;
of variance. There is evidence to suggest that the ratio of the between component of variance&#xd;
to the total variance will remain relatively constant over a range of studies of similar types.&#xd;
Moreover, in many cases this intraclass correlation, which is the ratio of the between unit variance to the total variance, will be relatively small, often 0.1 or less. Such situations exist in education, agriculture, and medicine to name a few.&#xd;
&#xd;
The present study discusses how to use such prior information on the intraclass correlation&#xd;
coefficient (ICC) to obtain inferences about differences among treatments in the face of no&#xd;
replication. Several strategies that use the ICC are recommended for different situations and&#xd;
various designs. Their properties are investigated. Work is extended to under-replicated&#xd;
experiments. The work has a Bayesian flavor but avoids the full Bayesian analysis, which has&#xd;
computational complexities and the potential for lack of acceptance among many applied&#xd;
researchers. This study compares the prior information ICC methods with traditional&#xd;
methods. Situations are suggested in which prior information ICC methods are preferable to&#xd;
traditional methods and those in which the traditional methods are preferable.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to learn the perceived training needs of the support staff in the six Kansas Board of Regents’ (KBOR) university libraries.  Based on data from field and pilot studies and advice from an expert panel, a survey instrument was designed to assess library support staff’s perceptions of their train needs on computer skills, interpersonal skills, supervision/management skills, important library/organizational support, helpful training delivery methods, and training sources. The survey instrument was administered to the entire 167 support staff in the six KBOR university libraries, with a return rate of 83 percent achieved through two mailings and two postcard reminders. Quantitative data from the responses to closed-ended questions were analyzed through descriptive measures and one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Qualitative approaches to code answers from open-ended questions were utilized in order to allow stakeholder themes to emerge.&#xd;
	Quantitative analyses indicated that the respondents viewed the most important training topics for each area of the study to be: database searching and MS Office suites for computer skills; working with difficult people and managing priorities for interpersonal skills; training new employees and supervising student employees  &#xd;
for supervision/management skills;  being supplied with appropriate software, release time, and technical support were viewed as the most important library support that would help their training.  The respondents perceived classroom instruction with a teacher and  interactive classroom discussions as being the most helpful delivery methods.  The respondents considered in-house trainers, supervisors, and co-workers as being the most helpful training sources. A series of MANOVA tests were conducted on the six areas of the study. At the alpha = .05 level, statistically significant differences were found in the respondents’ perceptions of training needs on computer skills measured by their work units, supervision/management skills measured by their work units and level of job responsibilities, the respondents’ perceptions of important library/organizational support measured by their total years in the library filed and age range, and the respondents’ perceptions of helpful training sources measured by their total years at current positions. &#xd;
	Qualitative analyses provided 314 units of information on 32 themes on additional training topics, library/organizational support, delivery methods, and training sources. The top 10 themes were related to “Software programs,”  “Windows operating systems,” “Release time,” “Supervisor/management support,”  “Relevance/applicable training,” “Promotion/opportunities,”   “Training for motivation,”  “Classroom with feedback,”  “Training materials,” and  “One-on-one and in-house training.”&#xd;
	Based on the findings, summaries, and conclusions of this study, the researcher made recommendations for further study that focuses on job training needs of support staff at university libraries, including a broader scope of training topics, motivating factors, the perceptions of library administrators on the support staff’s training needs, training needs on supervision/management for non-supervision support staff, differing views on library/organizational support, different training delivery methods, etc.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Binge drinking is a serious health problem among American college students (Wechsler, Lee, Kuo, &amp; Lee, 2000a). One technique that may reduce binge drinking is compliance. Cialdini (2001) defined compliance as taking an action because it has been requested and described sequential request tactics, including the commitment/consistency-based foot-in-the-door (FITD) tactic, and the reciprocity-based door-in-the-face (DITF) tactic. Cialdini claimed that these tactics yield automatic compliance. The present research investigated Cialdini’s automaticity assumption within the context of reducing binge drinking, by including a neutral or weak message along with the compliance request (consistent with Brannon &amp; Brock, 2001). The main hypothesis was that compliance is not automatic, as demonstrated by differential compliance consistent with message strength. Parallel experiments investigated compliance with requests to reduce one’s drinking behavior (Experiment 1, N=129) or communicate about responsible drinking (Experiment 2, N=122). Participants were randomly assigned to one of six conditions in each experiment. Consistent with the purpose of each experiment, participants indicated whether they would comply with initial requests consistent with FITD and DITF methodology, or were not asked to comply with an initial request (control); read either a neutral or weak message about the importance of moderate alcohol consumption; then responded to the target request (dependent variable) by reporting the likelihood that they would not drink excessively for one week (Experiment 1) or would discuss responsible drinking with someone (Experiment 2). Participants in both experiments completed demographic and alcohol consumption information and a social desirability measure (Strahan &amp; Gerbasi, 1972). Data were submitted to 2(Strength) × 3(Appeal) × 2(Gender) ANCOVAs (drinks per occasion and social desirability were covariates). Experiment 1 revealed a significant Strength × Appeal interaction, with the DITF and FITD appeals eliciting lower compliance rates than the control appeal when accompanied by a weak persuasive message, thereby refuting Cialdini’s automaticity assumption. A significant main effect for appeal in Experiment 2 (DITF yielded lower compliance than FITD or control appeal) did not support Cialdini’s (2001) claim. Correlates of drinking behavior among college students are discussed, as are implications of the present research for compliance theory and reducing binge drinking on American college campuses.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There has been a steady rise in the number of adult degree completion programs in the last twenty years, and predictions indicate the trend will continue. Simultaneously there is a growing concern for quality in higher education. One of the ways that any organization can assess quality is to gain consensus from a variety of stakeholders as to what institutional goals should be pursued and then measure the level to which those goals are met. The Institutional Goals Inventory consists of 90 goal statements that measure 20 outcome and process goal areas and asks a variety of stakeholders to assess perceptions of both real and ideal goals within an institution. This exploratory, descriptive study polled faculty, students and administrators (n=224) in three Kansas area adult degree completion programs. Questions guiding this study included finding out what goal areas the various stakeholders deemed most and least important, whether or not there was a significant difference in those perceptions between stakeholder groups and/or institutions, and how well each of the institutions is meeting the goals their stakeholders deem most important. Results indicate that all stakeholder groups agree that the Principles of Good Practice for Alternative and External Degree Programs both is and should be important in these programs. Other highly ranked real and ideal goal areas were Academic Development, Community, and Intellectual Orientation. The results also show that while there is a fair amount of consensus among and between stakeholders and institutions on real and ideal goal in these programs, in virtually all instances the stakeholders rated all ideal goal areas as significantly higher than the real goal areas. Several recommendations for adult degree completion programs are offered as well as a lengthy list of suggestions for future research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research shows that industry and company related performance indicators enhance the business valuation process by providing a broader, more encompassing view of overall corporate health and a better understanding of improvement opportunity areas within a company.   To incorporate performance indicators in the business valuation process, new methodologies are required to integrate the non-financial and soft data with the typical financial information used in business valuation.  This requires a “re-think” of the standard business valuation process and the exploration and application of other methods and analytical techniques.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The results of this research are the definition of a problem type and the development of a new business valuation process.  The problem structure has as inputs industry specific performance metrics grouped into three primary areas Production Processes, Products/Services and Marketability and Management, a fuzzy logic model with fuzzy and approximate relationships between performance metrics and financial information and crisp financial information as output.  The framework for a fuzzy logic model was developed and is used to approximate relationships and model a non-linear environment.  The resulting crisp financial information is then input and integrated into the traditional business valuation process.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The process was demonstrated with an example production company and with data from two regional airlines.  A step-by-step example of the process was provided using the production company example to demonstrate how the results are generated and integrated with DCF business valuation.  Heuristics to identify areas to improve company performance were described.  Two regional airlines, individually and combined, were tested with actual data using the original fuzzy logic model structure and then the original fuzzy logic model structure was revised and new results generated.   Tuning the model showed an improvement in the business valuation process performance.  The benefits from this research include the definition of a new class of problems and a process to solve problems of this nature.  The insights gained from this research can be applied in major disciplines such as accounting, business and finance, engineering and decision theory.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objectives of this research were to address the impacts of positive and negative emotions on customers’ satisfaction and customers’ repeat visit intentions, and to investigate the mediating effect of customer satisfaction on the relationship between emotion and customers’ repeat visit intentions.  A theoretical model of the formation of repeat visit intentions was proposed through a comprehensive review of the literature. &#xd;
	Richins’ Consumption Emotion Set (1997) was modified to make it suitable for application in the lodging industry.  The modifications were based on the participants’ responses to each emotion descriptor in the pilot test.  Surveys were completed by graduate students and faculty members, undergraduate students at a Midwestern university, and conference attendees.  Of 259 surveys returned, 248 responses were used for data analysis.  Data were analyzed using factor analysis and a series of regression analysis.&#xd;
	Positive and negative consumption emotions were found to have a significant effect on customer satisfaction and repeat visit intentions.  Results also provided evidence of a significant association between customer satisfaction and repeat visit intentions.  Customer satisfaction was found to be a full mediator in the relationship between customers’ positive and negative consumption emotions and repeat visit intentions.  &#xd;
The loss aversion of the prospect theory was empirically supported in the formation of customers’ repeat visit intentions since results indicate that negative emotion has a greater influence on customer satisfaction and customers’ repeat visit intentions.  Results support the importance of considering the impact of customers’ emotions on post-purchasing behaviors when developing better marketing and service strategies to achieve higher occupancy rate and retain customers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Group decision-making is an essential activity is many domains such as financial,&#xd;
engineering, and medical fields. Group decision-making basically solicits opinions from&#xd;
experts and combines these judgments into a coherent group decision. Experts typically&#xd;
express their opinion in many different formats belonging to two categories: quantitative&#xd;
evaluations and qualitative ones. Many times experts cannot express judgment in&#xd;
accurate numerical terms and use linguistic labels or fuzzy preferences. The use of&#xd;
linguistic labels makes expert judgment more reliable and informative for decisionmaking.&#xd;
In this research, a new linguistic label fusion operator has been developed. The operator&#xd;
helps mapping one set of linguistic labels into another. This gives decision makers more&#xd;
freedom to choose their own linguistic preference labels with different granularities&#xd;
and/or associated membership functions.&#xd;
Three new consensus measure methods have been developed for group decision making&#xd;
problem in this research. One is a Markov chain based consensus measure method, the&#xd;
other is order based, and the last one is a similarity based consensus measure approach.&#xd;
Also, in this research, the author extended the concept of Ordered Weighted Average&#xd;
(OWA) into a fuzzy linguistic OWA (FLOWA). This aggregation operator is more&#xd;
detailed and includes more information about the aggregate than existing direct methods.&#xd;
After measuring the current consensus, we provide a method for experts to modify their&#xd;
evaluations to improve the consensus level. A cost based analysis gives the least cost&#xd;
suggestion for this modification, and generates a least cost of group consensus.  In addition, in this research I developed an optimization method to maximize two types&#xd;
of consensus under a budget constraint.&#xd;
Finally considering utilization of the consensus provides a practical recommendation to&#xd;
the desired level of consensus, considering its cost benefits.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Understanding association members’ meeting participation behaviors is the key to the well-attended meeting, which is a common goal of both associations and host destinations.  However, little research has contributed to theoretical development in this area, and the lack of a theoretical framework has negatively influenced the validity of existing research. Thus, this study attempted to explain association members’ meeting participation behaviors, using a conceptually sound model of meeting participation, which was developed based on existing human behavior theories: the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Another main objective of this study was to test the validity of the meeting participation model (MPM). By comparing the utility of three competing models (TRA, TPB, and MPM), this study confirmed the effectiveness of the meeting participation model (MPM) in explaining association members’ intentions to attend the annual meeting. &#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed meeting participation model was empirically examined using the data collected from 245 members of the International Council on Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Education (CHRIE). The results of model development revealed that the MPM fits the data very well, providing a systematic view of the decision-making process of association meeting participation. In addition, the findings of the model comparison using the structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that all three competing models successfully provide a theoretical base for understanding association members’ meeting participation behaviors. Specifically, the MPM provided a fuller understanding of meeting participation intention by adding two predictor variables (destination image and past meeting participation experience) to the TPB.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This study is the first research effort to investigate what makes association members attend, or not attend, association meetings based on theoretical frameworks. TRA and TPB provided the necessary theoretical ground to develop the meeting participation model (MPM). By adding a domain specific predictor variable (destination image) and a non-volitional habitual construct (past experience) to the original latent constructs conceptualized in pure TRA/TPB models, the MPM emerged as a theoretically strong and parsimonious framework for understanding association members’ meeting participation behaviors. The results of the current study present a strong step toward providing practical as well as theoretical implications for future convention research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bayesian networks are graphical models whose nodes represent random variables and whose edges represent conditional dependence between variables.  Each node in a Bayesian network is equipped with a conditional probability function that expresses the likelihood that the node will take on different values given the values of its parents.  A common task for a Bayesian network is to perform inference by computing the marginal probabilities of each possible value for each node.  In this thesis, I introduce three new algorithms for approximate inference of Bayesian networks that use edge deletion techniques.  &#xd;
The first reduces a network to its maximal weight spanning tree using the Kullback-Leibler information divergence as edge weights, and then runs Pearl’s algorithm on the resulting tree.  Because Pearl’s algorithm can perform inference on a tree in linear time, as opposed to the exponential running time of all general exact inference algorithms, this reduction results in a tremendous speedup in inference.  &#xd;
The second algorithm applies triangulation pre-processing rules that are guaranteed to be optimal if the original graph has a treewidth of four or less, and then deletes edges from the network and continues applying rules so that the resulting triangulated graph will have a maximum clique size of no more than five.  The junction tree exact inference algorithm can then be run on the reduced triangulated graph.  While the junction tree algorithm has an exponential worst-case running time in the size of the maximum clique in the triangulated graph, placing a bound on the clique size effectively places a polynomial time bound on the inference procedure.  &#xd;
The third algorithm deletes edges from a triangulation of the original network until the maximum clique size in the triangulated graph is below a desired bound.  Again, the junction tree algorithm can then be run on the resulting triangulated graph, and the bound on the maximum clique size will also polynomially bound the inference time.&#xd;
When tested for efficiency and accuracy on common Bayesian networks, these three algorithms perform up to 10,000 times faster than current exact and approximate techniques while achieving error values close to those of sampling techniques.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The physical environment may be an important determinant of customer satisfaction and&#xd;
subsequent behavior when services are consumed primarily for hedonic purposes and customers&#xd;
spend moderate to long periods of time in the physical surroundings. An example of this&#xd;
phenomenon would be in an upscale restaurant setting.&#xd;
This study explored the domain of the physical environment in an upscale restaurant&#xd;
context to develop a DINESCAPE scale. Relevant literature was reviewed on architecture,&#xd;
environmental psychology, psychology, operations management, and marketing, highlighting&#xd;
empirical and theoretical contributions. Conceptualization and operationalization of the&#xd;
DINESCAPE dimensions is presented, and the procedures used in constructing and refining a&#xd;
multiple-item scale to assess DINESCAPE in an upscale restaurant setting are described.&#xd;
DINESCAPE is a six-factor scale that was developed to measure facility aesthetics, ambience,&#xd;
lighting, service product, layout, and social factors. Evidence of the scale’s reliability, validity,&#xd;
and factor structure is presented, along with potential applications of the scale.&#xd;
The second phase of the study attempted to build a conceptual model of how the&#xd;
DINESCAPE factors influenced customers’ behavioral intentions through their emotions. The&#xd;
Mehrabian-Russell environmental psychology model was adopted to explore the linkage of the&#xd;
six dimensions of DINESCAPE to customers’ emotional states (pleasure and arousal) and the&#xd;
linkage between pleasure and arousal with customers’ behavioral intentions. Structural equation&#xd;
modeling was used to test the causal relationships among the hypothesized relationships. Results&#xd;
revealed that facility aesthetics, ambience, and social factors affected the level of customers’&#xd;
pleasure and ambience and social factors influenced the amount of arousal. In addition, pleasure and arousal had significant effects on subsequent behavioral intentions in the context of&#xd;

<dc:description>Thin films can be created on the surface of a metal, protecting it from oxidation and corrosion. Phosphate films have historically been a common choice for these corrosion resistant films. In this dissertation, the oxidation of vanadium metal by water and atmosphere is studied. Also, a series of phosphate films on the surface of vanadium metal were created and are studied as potential corrosion resistant films. Lastly, an independent study identifying the oxidation state of copper in a biological sample is carried out. To characterize these thin films, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is employed. The reaction of vanadium metal with the atmosphere and distilled, de-ionized, water is studied. The core level and valence band results are explored and compared to calculated valence band spectra for some vanadium oxides. The etching of vanadium metal and reaction of the etched metal with a phosphoric acid solution are studied. Synthesized vanadium phosphate compounds serve as model compounds for the analysis of a phosphate coating created on the surface of vanadium metal by the reaction of vanadium metal with phosphoric acid by a newly developed bench top method. The core level and valence band regions for the compounds and coating are discussed along with cluster and band structure calculations for interpretation. The variation in the coating on vanadium metal by biasing the metal at different potentials during reaction is also studied. Coatings are also created on vanadium metal using different forms of phosphorus oxy-acid. An analysis of the various coatings is performed by XPS and accompanied by predictive calculations.  In an additional study, the oxidation state of copper in a biological compound is identified. The analysis makes use of satellite features commonly seen in XPS to make the determination. A discussion of the origin of these features and the energy of the shifts is given, along with the results for the other core level XPS regions for the compound.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In recent years, coherent excitation techniques have focused on the&#xd;
ability to efficiently prepare atomic or molecular systems into a&#xd;
selected state.  Such population control plays a key role in&#xd;
cutting-edge research taking place today, such as in the areas of&#xd;
quantum information and laser-controlled chemical reactions.&#xd;
Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a widely-used&#xd;
coherent excitation technique that provides a relatively robust&#xd;
control mechanism for efficiently exciting a target population into&#xd;
a desired state. While the technique is well proven, current&#xd;
experimental techniques yield little information on the population&#xd;
dynamics taking place throughout the excitation process, and&#xd;
experimentalists rely solely on final excited-state measurements to&#xd;
determine the efficiency of population transfer. This dissertation&#xd;
presents a unique diagnostic tool to measure multilevel coherent&#xd;
population transfer on a short (nanosecond) timescale.  The&#xd;
technique described here uses magneto-optical trap recoil ion&#xd;
momentum spectroscopy (MOTRIMS) as a noninvasive probe of a&#xd;
coherently-controlled system.   It provides extremely detailed&#xd;
information about the excitation process, and highlights some&#xd;
important characteristics seen in excited populations that would&#xd;
otherwise be misleading or completely overlooked if one were to use&#xd;
more traditional diagnostic techniques.  This dissertation discusses&#xd;
both the theoretical and experimental results applied to three-level&#xd;
coherently excited target populations of Rb-87.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents a model which identifies areas in state parks most susceptible to recreation related degradation. Factors of soil capability class rankings, slope, native vegetation presence, rangeland productivity, visitation, and revenue are overlaid in a weighted raster model to extract those land parcels within Glen Elder State Park, Kansas, which have the highest susceptibility to environmental degradation and greatest potential to generate high revenue. Park user characteristics stored in an attribute table are related to vulnerable parcels so park managers can develop management or mitigation strategies reflecting the strength of environmental, social, or economic interactions in an area.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Research shows the practice of incorporating English language learner (ELL)&#xd;
students’ native languages (L1) into instruction to be a major factor enhancing their&#xd;
success in school. In this study, 327 predominantly English-speaking (PES) teachers in&#xd;
the state of Kansas were surveyed on their perspectives and self-reported behaviors&#xd;
related to this practice. Participants were divided among three targeted teacher groups:&#xd;
pre-service teachers with no ESL-specific university preparation (PS), experienced&#xd;
teachers with no ESL-specific university preparation (No-ESL), and experienced teachers&#xd;
with significant (at least three courses) ESL-specific university preparation (C-ESL).&#xd;
Findings from descriptive analyses indicated that while teachers generally&#xd;
supported L1 use in instruction, they tended to show stronger support for its underlying&#xd;
theory than for its practical implementation. Results from a series of ANOVA’s&#xd;
suggested a clear link between ESL-specific university preparation and an increased&#xd;
support for the theory and practice of L1 use in instruction. Findings further suggested&#xd;
links among some combination of teaching experience and an increase in support for this&#xd;
practice. A series of inter-correlations produced various modest to moderate significant&#xd;
relationships among experienced teachers’ perspectives and demographic variables&#xd;
(gender, experience with ELL students).&#xd;
While both No-ESL and C-ESL teachers reported behaviors incorporating L1 use&#xd;
into instruction to some degree, results from independent samples t-tests showed that CESL&#xd;
teachers reported these behaviors significantly more often than No-ESL teachers.&#xd;
For both experienced teacher groups, inter-correlations showed modest to moderate&#xd;
significant relationships among a number of perspective items and behavior items.  Results further indicated that although both groups shared some common relationships&#xd;
among variables, for the most part, the relationships shown to be significant varied&#xd;
considerably by group. Open-ended questions revealed a variety of approaches used by&#xd;
teachers as well as a number of obstacles perceived by teachers in incorporating L1 use in&#xd;
instruction. Findings from this study are discussed in relation to strategies and directions&#xd;
for teacher educators with the responsibility of preparing PES teachers to effectively&#xd;
serve increasing ELL student populations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between&#xd;
demographic and educational variables, epistemological beliefs as measured by&#xd;
Schommer’s Epistemological Questionnaire (SEQ), and learner perception of selfdirectedness&#xd;
as measured by Guglielmino’s Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale&#xd;
(SDLRS). Participants in this study were undergraduate adult students at a private&#xd;
university in the Midwest region of the United States (N=394). The instruments were&#xd;
administered online during regularly scheduled courses. Data were analyzed at the p&lt;.05&#xd;
level of significance using Pearson product-moment correlations, factor analysis,&#xd;
stepwise multiple regression, and other statistical techniques.&#xd;
Results of this research included several significant correlations between&#xd;
demographic and educational variables, SEQ factors, and SDLRS total and factor scores.&#xd;
The educational variables of class standing, exposure to the humanities, and exposure to&#xd;
the social sciences significantly correlated with five SDLRS and SEQ total and factor&#xd;
scores. The greatest number of correlations occurred between SEQ factor 2, thinking for&#xd;
yourself is a waste of time, and the SDLRS factors of openness to learning opportunities,&#xd;
view of self as an effective and independent learner, independence and initiative in&#xd;
learning, responsibility for learning, and creativity. Other significant correlations with&#xd;
SEQ factors and SDLRS total and factor scores included age, gender, race, marital status,&#xd;
mother’s and father’s education level, credit earned through independent studies, cohort&#xd;
or non-cohort program type, grade point average, and exposure to learning contracts.&#xd;
Significant findings from the correlations of demographic and educational&#xd;
variables (p&lt;.002) and SEQ factors (p&lt;.05) with SDLRS total scores were entered into a stepwise multiple regression. One educational variable and three SEQ factors accounted&#xd;
for 25.7% of the variance in SDLRS total scores.&#xd;
Several suggestions for the development of expanded empirical and theoretical&#xd;
research initiatives and the improvement of practice were offered. This research provided&#xd;
a clear and compelling rationale for the establishment of adult degree programs which are&#xd;
grounded in the liberal arts, include both career and personal development activities, and&#xd;
allow for increased opportunities for learner self-direction to occur. These elements are&#xd;
necessary to build what Kegan (1994) called a developmental bridge for adult learners.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Eduard Lindeman (1926) stated, “the approach to adult education will be via the route of&#xd;
situations” (p. 8, emphasis in original). Training professionals often face situations that require&#xd;
them to develop and present training programs on subjects for which they have limited or no&#xd;
previous content expertise. This occurs even though the literature stresses the need for trainers to&#xd;
be experts or masters on the material they present (Bernthal et al., 2004; Brookfield, 1990;&#xd;
Draves, 1984, 2000; Galbraith, 1990; Houle, 1984; Long, 2002; McArdle, 1993; McCain, 1999;&#xd;
Slusarski, 1994; Symonds, 1968; Wlodkowski, 1999). Although there is considerable literature&#xd;
on the roles and responsibilities of trainers (McLagan &amp; Suhadolnik, 1989; Nadler &amp; Nadler,&#xd;
1989), self-directed learning (Candy, 1991; Knowles, 1975; Tough, 1979), and developing&#xd;
training programs (Caffarella, 2002; Long, 1983; McCain, 1999), very little links these areas&#xd;
with the knowledge acquisition process trainers use.&#xd;
This dissertation describes the phenomenological inquiry into the nature of the process&#xd;
trainers use to acquire the knowledge necessary to develop and present training programs for&#xd;
which they have little or no previous content expertise. The population was selected because of&#xd;
the researcher’s background in training and adult education. Criterion, snowball, convenience,&#xd;
and maximum variation purposeful sampling techniques were used to identify trainers who met&#xd;
the criterion of the study. Potential participants were contacted by the researcher and asked to&#xd;
participate in the study. Data was collected via semistructured interviews until thematic&#xd;
saturation was reached. Constant comparison was used to analyze the transcripts of the&#xd;
interviews.&#xd;
Twenty-six common themes were identified during the study and were categorized into&#xd;
six different categories. The six categories are self-directed learning, the training and development process becomes part of the trainer’s life, the needs assessment is part of&#xd;
knowledge acquisition, knowledge acquisition is a continuous part of the trainer’s life,&#xd;
understanding the importance of adult learning principles, and reflection. The results of this&#xd;
study have implications for the adult education, self-directed learning, program planning, human&#xd;
resource development, and training literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>1219 Colorado is the documentation of the nonlinear process of design as it applies to the reconfiguration of a residential dwelling. This process is illustrated through a collection of sketches, design drawings, construction documents and images produced from 1999 to 2005. 1219 Colorado investigates materiality the physical substance of architecture, as well as the nature of thoughtful connection physical and theoretical through the process of making. The need to build, to make, to design, and explore is what drives the process. While the space of architecture is most often designed and perceived as lines on paper, it is through the making of physical models that the creative act of discovery reveals its greatest potential. &#xd;
	The process explores the design of a model constructed at full-scale. No longer representational, the study is the product; the materials and methods are genuine. This process differs from the process of building in that the intention is no longer to construct only that which is designed. Rather the challenge is to explore beyond the design, reveal new possibilities, refine design decisions, and most importantly to take advantage of unforeseen opportunities that are revealed through the act of making. &#xd;
	The scope of the task expanded periodically as a function of increasing knowledge of construction, declining acceptance of the quality of the existing condition and in order to accommodate an evolving set of programmatic requirements. To date the construct has under gone no less than three different design schemes, and a fourth will follow as the process continues to be refined and reconsidered. The project continues to evolve, grow, and change directions. 1219 Colorado explores design is not a linear process. Architecture is not always pretty.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Film allows a different way of looking at space than architecture. It gives easier access to the set-up world of the narrative. The narrative is the story of what happens in the spaces—what the idea of the space is—its ritual. Using the media of film presents a better understanding of a world through the projected images to the designer and viewers.&#xd;
&#xd;
A short film—Poesis—was made to provoke poetic images. The film was used to construct architecture through film, developing a process of making and a more complete understanding of architecture. Each space was treated as a repository for a poetic image. The poetic image is art, a connection to memory, and viewed through materiality. The poetic image allows a relationship with reality, while giving a new awareness of the world at hand. Art is defined as something that sets up a world for someone to enter. Film and architecture both set up a world that is created through memory and material, thus art. Memory is a narrative that does not depend on time, but instead movement through space. Memory allows for empathy from the viewer, creating a connection with the world and characters in it. Materials create surfaces. Surfaces meet at corners and the meeting of these surfaces create a container for space. The space that these surfaces hold give new memories that are poetic images. Andrei Tarkovsky wrote, “Poetry is an awareness of the world, a particular way of relating to reality.” The poetic image is understood as a better understanding, or awareness, of the world we dwell in. Poesis was created as art, setting up a world for someone to enter; not only the character, but the audience as well. The character’s memory of space was taken away in order to purge the desensitization created from the bombardment of images of our culture, and to present the character with new memories of space. Giving these new, simpler notions of space allowed for a more innocent view and awareness of his surroundings. Using these things together created the poetic image of the film—a new awareness and understanding of the world we dwell within.&#xd;
&#xd;
The process of constructing architecture through film allowed for a more complete image of the building being designed. Film is an art that sets up the world that the narrative of the story takes place in with clear and concise juxtaposed images. The process of constructing was a different way of treating the space so it contained the poetic image. The film became a tool of communication for the architecture and its poetics. A more complete understanding of what the space was emerged by looking through the eyes of a filmmaker. A new sense of space developed through this process of making.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Crystal engineering, or non-covalent synthesis in the solid state, requires an&#xd;
understanding of intermolecular forces, and the hydrogen bond has become a reliable&#xd;
non-covalent tool in the construction of supramolecular architectures. In the same way&#xd;
that synthetic chemists refer to a “yield” to quantify a desired product, crystal engineers&#xd;
typically determine the successful formation of a supramolecular product according to the&#xd;
frequency or occurrence of preferred intermolecular interactions between molecules&#xd;
under certain reaction conditions, thus, the supramolecular yield. These non-covalent&#xd;
reactions can be effectively carried out using supramolecular reagents (SR’s).&#xd;
A family of ditopic bis-imidazol-1-yl/benzimidazol-1-yl compounds were synthesized&#xd;
and used as SR’s in combination with a variety of dicarboxylic acids to produce binary&#xd;
solids in 100% yield through the primary acid···imidazol-1-yl/benzimidazol-1-yl synthons&#xd;
even in the presence of potentially disruptive intermolecular interactions. We&#xd;
furthermore noted that secondary C–H···O interactions within and between 1-D chains&#xd;
were of equal structural importance based upon an analysis of the metrics displayed by&#xd;
these interactions. The use of these SR’s as ligands with neutrally charged metal&#xd;
complexes was also investigated.&#xd;
SR’s containing benzimidazol-1-yl and carboxamide moieties were synthesized and&#xd;
combined with two different carboxylic acids to make ternary solids through&#xd;
acid···benzimidazol-1-yl and carboxamide···acid hydrogen bonds using a hierarchical&#xd;
approach – the best donor-best acceptor, second best donor-second best acceptor&#xd;
guidelines. These SR’s were also employed as ligands for high-yielding syntheses of&#xd;
linear metal complexes where neighboring complexes are linked via&#xd;
carboxamide···carboxamide hydrogen bonds.&#xd;
Asymmetric SR’s possessing two different N-heterocycles were synthesized and&#xd;
employed in the construction of ternary supermolecules with a high degree of structural&#xd;
selectivity and specificity when introduced to two different carboxylic acids. The&#xd;
stronger acid interacts at the more basic site, while the weaker acid hydrogen-bonds with&#xd;
the less basic nitrogen atom. Finally, an SR containing three different binding sites was&#xd;
designed and synthesized with the aim of producing quaternary co-crystals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explored the implications of cultural conceptions of the self (independent vs. interdependent) for epistemological beliefs, ways of knowing, and academic studying. Community college students (N = 340) were recruited from two community colleges in the Midwestern United States and one predominantly Hispanic community college in the Southwestern United States. Students completed a number of paper-and-pencil instruments, including measures of epistemological beliefs, self-construal, ways of knowing, and approaches to studying. As predicted, significant correlations were found between interdependent self-construal and omniscient authority, and also between interdependent self-construal and connected knowing. Although no effects were found for ethnicity on epistemological beliefs and ways of knowing, acculturation appears to be an important influence on ways of knowing. A path analysis indicated that acculturation exhibited both a direct and indirect effect on connected knowing. The indirect effect on connected knowing was through interdependent self-construal. Students who were less acculturated (i.e. more likely to speak English as a second language or to be born in another country) were more likely to endorse an interdependent self-construal, and consequently more likely to endorse connected knowing. These results suggest that conceptions of the self may be important influences on personal epistemology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation explores the relationships between three groups of variables in the&#xd;
transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and Commonwealth of Independent&#xd;
States (CIS), from 1989 to 2003. The first group consists of output level and output growth as&#xd;
measured by gross domestic product index (GDPI) and gross domestic product growth (GDPG).&#xd;
The second group consists of two categories of institutional development (INST), and the third&#xd;
group of variables is structural policy reforms (SPR), often known as liberalization policies.&#xd;
This dissertation’s theoretical and empirical framework explicitly account for the&#xd;
endogeneity between output performance variables, the measures of institutional development&#xd;
and SPR. Several empirical specification models of the theoretical simultaneous system of three&#xd;
equations are estimated. In the first group of specification models the dependent endogenous&#xd;
variables are GDPG, SPR and INST, while in the second group the dependant endogenous&#xd;
variables are GDPI, SPR and INST. Moreover, two datasets are used. The first dataset has data&#xd;
from 1989 to 2003, thus covering the whole transition period, while the second dataset is a subset&#xd;
of the first one, containing data for the recovery stage of transition only.&#xd;
The empirical methods used in this dissertation include panel data analysis, principal&#xd;
component analysis, two stages least squares approach and three stage least squares approach in&#xd;
the presence of a SUR modeling procedure.&#xd;
With respect to the output performance equation, the findings of this research indicate&#xd;
that institutional reform (INSTREF), and property rights and contract enforcement institutions&#xd;
(PCINST and ROLINST) are very important determinants of output levels when the whole&#xd;
transition period dataset is used, and very important determinants of both the output levels and&#xd;
output growth rates when the recovery stage dataset is used. While the effect of current SPR is&#xd;
ambiguous, the effect of lagged SPR on output and output growth is positive. Moreover, SPR&#xd;
continue to affect output performance via their indirect effect on institutional development.&#xd;
With respect to the institutional reforms, and property rights and contract enforcement&#xd;
institutions, two sets of determinants were found to be important. On the side of the demand&#xd;
factors, SPR, and especially lagged SPR is found to be an important determinant of both&#xd;
institutional reforms and property rights and contract enforcement institutions. On the side of&#xd;
supply factors, macroeconomic stabilization, a measure of the state’s capacity to implement institutional reform, resulted very important in explaining the variation in institutional reform&#xd;
and property rights and contract enforcement institutions. Political reform, in terms of a shift&#xd;
from the autarkic political regime to a democratic political regime, is found to positively affect&#xd;
institutional development in the recovery stage.&#xd;
With respect to the structural policy reforms’ equations, this dissertation’s main finding is&#xd;
that political reform positively affects SPR in both datasets. Moreover, lagged SPR is found to&#xd;
positively affect SPR, which is an indication of transition governments’ maintained commitment&#xd;
to a package of SPR-s.</dc:description>

<dc:description>How does collaborative software help in the formation of a learning community? This study looks at the experiences of students in a first level Computer Science class as they use Manhattan Virtual Classroom (MVC). Although this case study began with the assumption that a learning community would form, it quickly became obvious that student participation in the MVC was a larger issue. &#xd;
&#xd;
The course chosen for this study was CSC-150 - Foundations of Computer Science, as taught in the Spring 2004 semester at a Midwestern university. Two traditional (face-to- face) course sections were given access to Manhattan Virtual Classroom for the purpose of discussions, comments, questions, and virtual office hours. &#xd;
&#xd;
Many students did not take advantage of this collaborative tool. Several reasons are considered, the reluctance of freshmen to participate (Goldberg, 1997; Carlson et al., 1996), professor teaching style, and student perceptions of their own contributions to the class. &#xd;
&#xd;
Several conclusions are drawn from this study how to increase student participation. These include better training in the use of the software, use of smaller groups within the Manhattan Virtual Classroom environment, clearly stated professor expectations, and a general adoption of this technology for other classes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The southern Sawatch Range of the Southern Rocky Mountains of south-central&#xd;
Colorado is composed of Precambrian crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks that&#xd;
have undergone at least three major mountain building events during the Phanerozoic, the&#xd;
Ancestral Rockies Orogeny, the Laramide Orogeny, and Rio Grande rifting. In order to&#xd;
determine how the ancient basement structures might have influenced later episodes of&#xd;
deformation, a small area of basement terrain was mapped along the western margin of&#xd;
the Poncha Pass transfer zone between the San Luis and Upper Arkansas basins in the&#xd;
northern Rio Grande rift.&#xd;
The two dominant rock types in the map area, (hornblendic) amphibolite gneiss&#xd;
and (felsic) quartzofeldspathic gneiss, may represent interlayered metabasalt/metadiorite&#xd;
and metarhyolite/metagranite, with lenses of exotic lithologies throughout. Metamorphic&#xd;
foliations were found to be oriented predominantly N35ºW 47ºNE and to have had an&#xd;
influence on younger brittle structures related to the rifting episode. Lineations and&#xd;
fractures in the gneissic fabric also are parallel to brittle deformation structures.&#xd;
Apatite Fission-Track (AFT) analysis provided a means of determining when this&#xd;
crust was exhumed and cooled by the removal of overburden in response to erosion&#xd;
and/or tectonics. The resultant AFT age distribution revealed that exhumation occurred&#xd;
at the higher elevations during the Laramide orogeny (~299-46 Ma), and at lower&#xd;
elevations during Rio Grande rifting (~29-19 Ma). Although it is commonly thought that&#xd;
these mountains were exhumed during the rifting episode, the results of this study&#xd;
indicate that older events played a significant role in the exhumation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>For the last decade in the U.S., consumers have demanded fresh,&#xd;
healthier convenience-type foods namely, fresh-cut vegetables. Globalization&#xd;
has played a major role in rapid growth of the fresh-cut industry sector. Thus,&#xd;
consumers may purchase their favorite seasonal vegetables in local grocery&#xd;
stores year-round. However, the convenience of year-round produce availability&#xd;
brings the potential of foodborne outbreaks. Thirty-two states reported 190&#xd;
produce-associated outbreaks, 16,058 reported illnesses, 598 hospitalizations,&#xd;
and eight deaths from 1973 to 1997. Pathogenic bacteria contaminate raw&#xd;
agricultural commodities through various pathways such as irrigation with&#xd;
untreated water, use of noncomposted animal manure as fertilizer, and wash&#xd;
water systems. The increasing number of produce-related outbreaks has raised&#xd;
awareness to interventions that remove human pathogens on fresh produce.&#xd;
Washing solely with tap water cannot be relied upon to completely remove&#xd;
pathogens. Chlorinated water is the most frequently used sanitizer, however,&#xd;
reductions are less than 2.63-log CFU/g on leafy and salad vegetables. Such&#xd;
reductions, although significant, are not sufficient to assure the microbial safety&#xd;
of minimally processed vegetables. The efficacy of several other chemical&#xd;
agents such as chlorine dioxide, ozone, electrolyzed water, hydrogen peroxide,&#xd;
organic acids, and other commercial products have been evaluated as potential&#xd;
alternatives to chlorine.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting the decision process of&#xd;
African American students regarding the choice of hospitality management as a career. The&#xd;
significant influence of others, perception and awareness of the industry, resistance to&#xd;
servitude, and personal background were explored in the context of Omi and Winantâs Racial&#xd;
Formation Theory.&#xd;
Focus groups were conducted with hospitality management and business students to&#xd;
investigate the above constructs in-depth. Questionnaires were administered to students&#xd;
enrolled in College of Businesses at 14 Historically Black Colleges and Universities who were&#xd;
majoring in hospitality management or some aspect of business. The results of the focus&#xd;
groups indicated that the students are aware that their race may determine what jobs they are&#xd;
offered in the hospitality industry, how rapidly they will be promoted, how society views them&#xd;
as individuals, and how society views an entire race when that particular race is found in low&#xd;
level jobs in large numbers or perception of an industry, and the pay scale.&#xd;
The students indicated that servitude is when one person has more power than someone&#xd;
else or someone is in control. Hospitality students were more likely to support the idea that the&#xd;
industry provides opportunities for advancements (Ï2 = 33.64, df = 3, p &lt; .001) and offer&#xd;
balanced pay in terms of race and ethnicity (Ï2 = 14.49, df = 3, p &lt; .01). For each servitude&#xd;
measure hospitality students were less likely to support notions of servitude in the hospitality&#xd;
industry than non-hospitality students. Non-hospitality students had a strong association with&#xd;
the idea that hospitality jobs are demeaning (Ï2 = 10.16, df = 3, p &lt; .05) and include positions&#xd;
that typically involved housekeeping and kitchen work (Ï2 = 28.72, df = 3, p &lt; .001). In&#xd;
general the data for African Americans revealed significant relationships between the outcome measure, career choice, and personal background (r = -.118, p &lt; .05), awareness and&#xd;
perception of the hospitality industry (r = .116, p &lt; .05) and significance of others (r = .164, p &lt;&#xd;
.01) using two-tailed test.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Improving use of statistical information by jurors by reducing confusion of the inverse</dc:title>

<dc:description>In many situations, people are called on to make judgments about the likelihood of an event.  Research has shown that when people make these judgments, they frequently equate or confuse conditional probabilities with other conditional probabilities.  This equating or confusing of conditional probabilities is known as the confusion of the inverse.  Research investigating this problem typically focuses on clinical and medical decision-making and the use of statistical evidence to make diagnoses.  However, one area in which the confusion of the inverse has not been studied is in juror decision-making.  Thus, the purpose of this dissertation was to (1) determine if the confusion of the inverse influences juror decision-making, (2) interpret reasons why this confusion occurs, and (3) attempt to eliminate it from juror decision-making.&#xd;
&#xd;
Jurors were presented with four court cases gathered from local and federal courthouses in a small Mid-western city.  In each of the four cases, a single piece of evidence was presented (statistical only) which was to be used when rendering verdicts.  Finally, each case contained juror instructions for the specific case type: murder, kidnapping, arson, sexual assault.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Overall, jurors fell prey to the confusion of the inverse, equating the probability of the data given the hypothesis [P(D|H)] with the probability of the hypothesis given the data [P(H|D)].  However, the research was unable to reduce the effect, much less eliminate it from the task.  Interestingly, jurors tended to ignore the statistical evidence (i.e., estimations about probability of a match) in favor of their own personal believe in the strength of the evidence.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although the original intent of reducing/eliminating the confusion of the inverse was not accomplished, the dissertation did accomplish three things.  First, researchers have hypothesized three reasons why people engage in incorrect probabilistic reasoning, and the dissertation affirmed that it is indeed a function of the confusion of conditional probabilities – the confusion of the inverse.  Second, it seems that the use of statistical evidence in a trial is ignored by most jurors in favor of their own personal belief in the evidence’s strength.  Finally, the criteria needed for “beyond a reasonable doubt” may be too stringent.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Instead of designing new proprietary hardware to replace aging, obsolete systems, the defense&#xd;
industry is looking towards Components Off The Shelf (COTS). COTS are attractive for a&#xd;
number of reasons. First, by using COTS, nonrecurring design costs are divided among all&#xd;
costumers. Second, because COTS suppliers have an economy of scale, the suppliers are able to&#xd;
reduce the cost of components, making systems more affordable than low-volume, proprietary&#xd;
solutions. Third, using COTS accelerates the time to market by reducing the time required for&#xd;
design and making extensive design verification unnecessary. Fourth, COTS hardware produces&#xd;
a scalable solution, as one COTS systems could easily be replaced with a different COTS system&#xd;
that would more readily meet the customer's unique demands.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis attempts to explain the implementation of a COTS-based flight computer. The PCI&#xd;
Mezzanine Card (PMC) standard has been selected because it is both rugged and widely&#xd;
accepted by industry. The PMC is a common standard with a variety of COTS parts, making it&#xd;
easily exchangeable. While the COTS solution reduces design overhead, it does not eliminate&#xd;
the need for design altogether. Although the contractor would no longer be required to design&#xd;
the features provided by the COTS, they would be required to design the overall system and the&#xd;
integration of the COTS.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis documents the design of a system that takes two PMC cards – the COTS – and&#xd;
integrates those cards together and interfaces them with the flight systems. The interfacing of&#xd;
COTS components is also extended to provide a high-speed serial link in order to connect two&#xd;
PMC carrier boards for a total of four COTS PMCs. Further, the testability of the final system is&#xd;
explored to provide an end product that is verifiably sufficient.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Though communication and learning theory suggest that human interaction is a&#xd;
key component that could enhance both processes, little has been done to incorporate&#xd;
these findings into the basic public speaking course. This study is an attempt to develop&#xd;
a dialogic approach for teaching the introductory college public speaking course.&#xd;
Through the incorporation of standardized analytic grading rubrics, instructor feedback&#xd;
prior to the public speaking performance, peer workshops, and peer evaluations of&#xd;
performances, a process-centered teaching approach is developed that has the potential to&#xd;
increase cognitive learning, improve the quality of student speeches, and increase the&#xd;
consistency between public speaking sections.&#xd;
After implementing this teaching approach for one semester, the results showed&#xd;
an increase in cognitive learning but no improvement in the quality of student speeches or&#xd;
grading consistency. However, a review of other research and the qualitative data&#xd;
collected in this study suggest that there might be greater impacts than could be seen here&#xd;
and that this approach needs to be developed and implemented over a longer period of&#xd;
time for its effects to be fully seen.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recent world events are motivating the United States Government to invest in the development of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW).  One defense contractor developing the technology, Raytheon Missile Systems Company, is addressing the cooling requirements. To this end, Raytheon has proposed some two-phase (liquid and vapor) heat transfer devices capable of dispersing the high energy densities associated with DEW. The Kansas State University Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering Department has been contracted to characterize the performance of the devices using ammonia as the working fluid.  To this end, an Ammonia Test Chamber was reconfigured to perform the experiments.  The chamber is now configured to deliver liquid ammonia at saturation pressures ranging from 45 to 115 psia, a sub-cooled liquid temperature of -25oC, and mass flow rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 kg/s.  The Ammonia Test Chamber can absorb heat loads of up to 5000 W.  Measurements of the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) of the device ranged from 173 W/cm2 to 488 W/cm2.  This data agrees characteristically with published correlations of CHF values, however the correlations predict lower magnitudes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the factors that influenced African American pastor’s perceptions of mental health issues and to explore how those perceptions influenced the propensity of the pastor to counsel, consult, and or refer to mental health professionals.  This study is divided into two parts.  Part one examines the perceptions of the pastors and their beliefs about mental health.  Part two concretized these perceptions by employing the Contextual Model of Family Stress as a guide for structuring the relationships between a pastor’s perception and their attitudes toward mental health issues.  &#xd;
	Data for this investigation were gathered from a sub-sample of African American pastors originally generated from a listing of churches throughout the country.   Initially 300 locally based institutions were identified.  A survey was mailed to the churches explaining the purpose and goals of the study.  Nearly one-third of the pastors completed the sixty-one item questionnaire.  Of those who returned the original questionnaires (102), nearly three-quarters were from African American pastors (73) all of whom were included in this study.&#xd;
There were four hypotheses developed for this exploratory investigation: they examined the pastor’s propensity to make mental health referrals; the tendency to spiritualize mental health issues; pastor’s lack of support for congregants with mental health problems; and the influence of mental health training on the willingness to refer to mental health professionals.  None of the hypotheses were directly supported.     &#xd;
	The application and adaptation of the Contextual Model of Family Stress to how African American pastors perceived, utilized, and responded to mental health issues was explored via path analysis.  Overall, the final model explained 39% of the variance in why pastors chose to make referrals to mental health professionals.&#xd;
	The findings suggested that the African American pastors are concerned with the mental health of their congregants.  Moreover, these pastors exhibited uncommon knowledge about mental health and displayed greater willingness to work with mental health professionals than originally believed.  These findings reveal that African American pastors are in touch with their congregants on multiple plains—spiritual, soul, and body—three vital dimensions, according to church doctrines and beliefs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The control of Indianmeal moth [Plodia interpunctella (Hübner)], a commonly found&#xd;
serious stored product pest around the world, relies mainly upon chemical control methods.&#xd;
Because of recent changes in the laws and regulations governing pesticide usage in the United States, there is an increasing need for finding safer chemicals to control insect pests. Hydroprene, an insect growth regulator, is considered to be a safe alternative. In this study, I quantified the effects of hydroprene on two critical life stages of Indianmeal moth, the eggs and 5th instar wandering phase larvae. Maximum development time in the untreated controls was 13.6 ± 0.6 d at 16°C and minimum development time was 2.3 ± 0.4 d at 32°C. At 20°C and 24°C, the effect of hydroprene on egg development became more evident; development time generally increased&#xd;
with exposure interval, with some variability in the data. The mean egg mortality among all&#xd;
temperatures was 7.3 ± 4.6%. Among the treatments, mortality of eggs increased as the exposure&#xd;
periods increased within any given temperature, with a dramatic increase in mortality with&#xd;
increase in temperature. Egg mortality was lowest at 16°C when exposed for 1 h (0 ± 3%), but&#xd;
mortality gradually increased up to 32 ± 3% when exposed for 18 h. Within each exposure&#xd;
interval, there was a direct increase in mortality as the temperatures increased. For the 5th instar&#xd;
wandering phase larvae, the longest development time among the treatments of 47.2 ± 1.3 d&#xd;
occurred at 16ºC when the larvae were exposed for 30 h, whereas the shortest development time&#xd;
of 7.0 ± 0.5 d occurred when the larvae were exposed for 1 h at 32ºC. Among treatments, the&#xd;
greatest larval mortality (82.0 ± 0.1%) occurred when larvae were exposed for 30 h at 28ºC,&#xd;
while the minimum mortality of 0.0 ± 0.5% occurred at 16ºC when larvae were exposed for 1 h.&#xd;
Response-surface models derived from this study can be used in simulation models to estimate&#xd;
the potential consequences of hydroprene on Indianmeal moth population dynamics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The native grasslands of North America are highly fragmented, and remaining tracts are intensively managed for grazing.  Loss of tallgrass prairie and changing land management practices has caused many grassland birds that rely on these areas for breeding to decline in population numbers.  To investigate resource selection and area use requirements of the upland sandpiper, we outfitted birds with radio transmitters at the experimentally managed Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeast Kansas.&#xd;
&#xd;
Two logistical challenges for wildlife telemetry projects are: minimizing the impact of radios on survival and movement, and optimizing the duration of transmitter attachment.  We compared 4 methods of radio attachment for upland sandpipers under field conditions at breeding sites in tallgrass prairie. The daily probabilities of radio retention (DRR) for our 4 attachment methods were: 0.9992 (SE = 0.0005, n = 85) for a leg loop harness, 0.9801 (SE = 0.0099, n = 11) for radios glued to clipped feathers, 0.9627 (SE = 0.0085, n = 25) for radios glued directly to feathers and 0.8538 (SE = 0.0322, n = 20) for radios glued to plucked skin.  The expected duration of radio attachment ranged from 1290 days for the leg loop harness, and 6 to 50 days for the glue attachment techniques.  Survival rates of males (DSR = 0.9987, SE = 0.0009, n = 53) and females (DSR = 0.9988, SE = 0.0008, n = 71) were similar, and the probability of surviving the 90-day breeding season was about 0.90 in both sexes.  We recommend attaching radios with glue to clipped feathers for short-term telemetry studies and a leg loop harness if longer retention is desired.&#xd;
&#xd;
The unique landscape of Konza Prairie allowed us to investigate specific tallgrass management strategies, and their impact on the range and habitat requirements of a bird that relies on the prairie for breeding.  We found that upland sandpipers have large home ranges during the breeding season (male:  = 199.0 ha ± 40.5 SE, n = 21, female:  = 247.7 ha ± 51.7 SE, n = 23).  Male home ranges were twice as large during brood-rearing ( = 200.8 ha ± 69.1 SE, n = 9) than during the nesting period ( = 67.02 ha ± 11.84 SE, n = 14,  1 = 5.14, P = 0.023).  Upland sandpipers selected home range sites that had been burned the same spring (n = 44, ²3 = 31.65, P &lt; 0.001), but did not show preference for certain habitat types within their home range ( ²3 = 1.49, P = 0.685).  During brood rearing upland sandpipers used sites with higher percentages of bare ground, herbaceous and short woody vegetation, and low amounts of vegetative litter.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Management strategies for the upland sandpiper should seek to preserve large contiguous tracts of tallgrass prairie that receive a heterogeneous mix of burning and grazing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Failure of passive transfer (FPT) is one of the main reasons for increased mortality rate in newborn calves and diagnosis is dependent on determination of serum IgG concentrations (diagnosis is based on &lt; 1 g/dL of total IgG). Several qualitative assays are available, but the reference method, single radial immunodiffusion assay (SRID), albeit quantitative measures only one subclass at a time. We set out to develop a competitive multiplex microsphere flow cytometry assay to measure bovine IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations in 30 serum samples acquired from newborn Holstein calves prior to and 24 hours after ingestion of colostrum and to compare the values with SRID. A triplex bead assay was created by mixing three distinct sets of Quantum plex carboxylated fluorescent microspheres that were coated with purified bovine IgG1, IgG2 or albumin using a two step chemical reaction. The triplex protein coated beads were reacted with a cocktail of sheep anti-bovine IgG1 and IgG2. Evaluation of analytical specificity demonstrated cross reactivity between anti-bovine IgG2 and IgG1 coated beads that precluded determination of IgG2 > 0.5 g/dL. Cross reactivity between anti-IgG1 and IgG2 coated beads was minimal and did not affect IgG1 concentrations between 0.15 to 1.2 g/dL. A competitive linear decrease in the fluorescence intensity was observed in the triplex assay when 2-fold dilutions spanning a concentration range of 12 mg/dL – 100 mg/dL of either purified bovine IgG1 or IgG2 were included as a competitive inhibitor of the reaction. Precolostral serum samples from 29 calves were determined to be &lt; 0.4 g/dL by SRID. Standard calibrants for the flow assay were prepared from two fold serial dilutions of purified bovine IgG (stock concentration 10 g/dL) using a precolostral calf serum pool as the diluent. The standard calibrants (IgG1 was 1.0- 0.16 g/dL and IgG2 was 3.4 – 0.22&#xd;
g/dL) were used as the inhibitors in a triplex assay to develop a standard curve for unknown samples. Dilutions of bovine reference serum containing known amounts of IgG1 (1.2 – 0.15 g/dL) and IgG2 (1.6 – 0.2 g/dL) was used as positive control. The intra Intra-assay and inter-assay precision of the mutiplex assay was good (coefficient of variation &lt; 10%). Since the IgG2 concentrations of post colostral samples were below detection limit, only IgG1 values were compared to the SRID. The agreement between triplex microsphere assay and SRID for IgG1 was poor with a mean bias of 0.743 g/dL towards triplex microsphere assay (95% confidence interval of 0.382 to 1.105 g/dL). Method comparison studies between total IgG determined by SRID and the gamma-globulin fraction determined by serum electrophoresis indicated that the SRID calculated higher values than the protein method (mean bias of -1.4 g/dL, 95% confidence interval was -1.8 to -1.05 g/dL). We hypothesized that the positive bias for the microsphere assay was explained in part by the use of dilution factors, use of standards that had a low analytical range, and erroneously high standards used in the SRID method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures is the primary document used by the state highway agencies to design new and rehabilitated highway pavements.  Currently the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) uses the 1993 edition of the AASHTO pavement design guide, based on empirical performance equations, for the design of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements (JPCP).  However, the newly released Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) provides methodologies for mechanistic-empirical pavement design while accounting for local materials, environmental conditions, and actual highway traffic load distribution by means of axle load spectra.&#xd;
&#xd;
The major objective of this study was to predict pavement distresses from the MEPDG design analysis for selected in-service JPCP projects in Kansas.  Five roadway sections designed by KDOT and three long term pavement performance (LTPP) sections in Kansas were analyzed.  Project-specific construction, materials, climatic, and traffic data were also generated in the study.  Typical examples of axle load spectra calculations from the existing Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) data were provided.  Vehicle class and hourly truck traffic distributions were also derived from Automatic Vehicle Classification (AVC) data provided by KDOT. The predicted output variables, IRI, percent slabs cracked, and faulting values, were compared with those obtained during annual pavement management system (PMS) condition survey done by KDOT.  A sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the sensitivity of the output variables due to variations in the key input parameters used in the design process. Finally, the interaction of selected significant factors through statistical analysis was identified to find the effect on current KDOT specifications for rigid pavement construction.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results showed that IRI was the most sensitive output.  For most projects in this study, the predicted IRI was similar to the measured values.  MEPDG analysis showed minimal or no faulting and was confirmed by visual observation.  Only a few projects showed some cracking.  It was also observed that the MEPDG outputs were very sensitive to some specific traffic, material, and construction input parameters such as, average daily truck traffic, truck percentages, dowel diameter, tied concrete shoulder, widened lane, slab thickness, coefficient of thermal expansion, compressive strength, base type, etc.  Statistical analysis results showed that the current KDOT Percent Within Limits (PWL) specifications for concrete pavement construction are more sensitive to the concrete strength than to the slab thickness.  Concrete slab thickness, strength, and truck traffic significantly influence the distresses predicted by MEPDG in most cases. The interactions among these factors are also almost always evident.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The primary purpose of this study was to determine if a semi-automated reasoning tool that provides a set of searchable cases would improve a student’s understanding of the more difficult concepts in an object-oriented programming course.  Also investigated were the relationships between the dependent variable student performance with independent variables of motivation, background knowledge, and student attitudes towards the semi-automated reasoning tool.  Subjects for the study were randomly assigned from two sections of an introductory object-oriented programming course at an NCAA, Division II university in the Midwest region of the United States.  Posttests were used to measure the effects of the semi-automated reasoning tool on learner competency.  Background knowledge was collected through student transcripts.  Motivation and student attitudes data were collected from surveys.  All data were collected during the Spring 2005 semester.  Data were analyzed at the p &lt; .05 level of significance using a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, mixed-design ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman rho correlations, and thematic analysis as well as other statistical techniques.   &#xd;
	Results of the study indicated a significant difference between the group who used the semi-automated reasoning tool on complex questions and the group who did not.  No significant difference was indicated between the groups on simple questions.  A strong positive correlation was indicated between background knowledge and the total test scores for both content areas tested.  Results of the correlational analysis between motivation and learner competencies indicated that the type of motivation, be it intrinsic or extrinsic, plays a minimal role in how students performed in this online course.  Finally, students overwhelmingly felt that the semi-automated reasoning tool was an effective instructional-support tool.&#xd;
	Results of this study suggested recommendations for practice as well as for further research.  Recommendations for practice include the need for effective use of course management systems, supporting complex content through examples, using performance on background coursework when considering an online course covering complex topics, providing a case-based instructional aid for complex topics, and minimizing the economic costs in using a case-based instructional aid.  Recommendations for future research include more research on relationships between background coursework and online courses, effects of a case-based instructional aid on face-to-face courses, development of overarching examples containing content from multiple computer science courses, improvements to the CBJava framework, and extending the framework to other disciplines.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a manifestation of the systemic disease of atherosclerosis that results in arterial stenoses of the lower extremities.  Patients with PAD demonstrate slowed dynamics of pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2 kinetics) following the onset of exercise and a profound reduction in peak oxygen uptake and work capacity.  However, whereas the primary pathophysiology of PAD results from the lower extremity hemodynamic limitation, there are abnormalities distal to the arterial stenoses in PAD-affected skeletal muscle that may also contribute to the impaired exercise responses. Thus, the potential contributions of abnormal muscle metabolism versus local circulatory defects in the PAD exercise impairment remains unclear. In this context, the purpose of the dissertation was to advance our understanding of the abnormal pulmonary VO2 kinetics in PAD and characterize the local muscle deoxygenation responses during the rest-exercise transition exercise in health and PAD.  The present series of investigations were designed to: 1. localize the abnormal pulmonary VO2 kinetics in PAD to the affected lower extremities, 2. characterize the kinetics of calf muscle deoxygenation during walking in PAD and healthy subjects, 3. describe muscle deoxygenation kinetics in relation to exercise work rate and blood flow in PAD and health, and 4. evaluate the effect of arterial revascularization on pulmonary VO2 kinetics in PAD.  These investigations revealed a persistent abnormality in muscle oxygen utilization in PAD-affected skeletal muscle that was not associated with the severity of hemodynamic compromise.  In particular, we observed slowed pulmonary VO2 kinetics in PAD only during exercise of the PAD-affected skeletal muscles.  Moreover, muscle deoxygenation kinetics following the onset of walking and lower intensity calf exercise were prolonged in PAD subjects while leg blood flow responses were normal.   However, at higher work rates, PAD muscle deoxygenation kinetics accelerated, demonstrating a work rate and presumably blood flow dependence.  Lastly, arterial revascularization tended to improve, but not consistently normalize, pulmonary VO2 kinetics in PAD subjects.  Thus, these investigations demonstrate abnormal oxygen uptake kinetics in PAD and provide evidence that local abnormalities of the affected skeletal muscle may contribute to the abnormal VO2 kinetics and exercise intolerance of patients with PAD.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Umbilical cord matrix or Wharton’s Jelly is a mucous connective tissue ensheathing the cord blood vessels and contains mesenchymal-like stem cells.  Previously, we have shown that pig umbilical cord matrix stem (pUCMS) cells transplanted into normal rat brain were recovered up to 6 weeks post-transplantation, where a sub-population of pUCMS cells exhibited neuronal morphology and expressed a variety of neuronal markers.  Here, approximately 150 pUCMS cells were transplanted into non-immunesuppressed rats that previously received a brain lesion by neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which specifically affects midbrain dopaminergic neurons, leading to pathologic findings similar to that of Parkinson’s disease (PD).  The pUCMS cells proliferated up to 8 weeks post-transplantation and there was a significant increase in the percentage and number of pUCMS cells expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is a marker for dopaminergic cells.  We conclude that 1. Xenotransplants of pig UCMS cells are not rejected by rats at least up to 8 weeks after transplantation and 2. The pig UCMS cells proliferate and differentiate after transplantation into PD model rats. &#xd;
&#xd;
The surface antigen and gene expression profile of human umbilical cord matrix stem (hUCMS) cells resemble that of mesenchymal stem cells.  Apomorphine-induced rotatory behavior was used to analyze the motor deficits of the PD model rats.  In different experiments 1000, 2500 and 25000 hUCMS cells were transplanted into the brain of non-immunesuppressed PD model rats.  There was a dose-dependent decrease in apomorphine-induced rotations; the maximum benefit was found in the rats that received 1000 hUCMS cells.  The graft cells were recovered at 2 days and 1 week, but not at 6, 10 or 12 weeks post-transplantation.  Quantitative assessment of host TH-positive midbrain dopaminergic neurons revealed a positive correlation between the behavioral improvement and TH-positive cell number in the low-density (1000 cells) transplant group, showing that the hUCMS cells may play a role in rescuing damaged host dopaminergic neurons and promote improvement of motor deficits in PD-model rats.  In summary, hUCMS cells appear to be mesenchymal stem cells that can be harvested in great numbers from a non-controversial, inexhaustible source.  Human UCMS cells show therapeutic benefit in PD model rats, but the mechanism by which they promote improvement is presently unknown.</dc:description>

<dc:description>P. syringae is a group of bacterial phytopathogens that can infect a wide variety of plants. These bacteria rely on the type III secretion system (TTSS) to deliver effectors into plant cells for infection. The TTSS genes, that encode the TTSS apparatus and the effectors, are repressed when bacteria grow in nutrient rich media but are strongly induced in the plants and in minimal medium (MM). Plant cutin monomers appear to negatively regulate the P. syringae TTSS genes. It is poorly understood how bacteria sense the environmental signals to regulate the TTSS genes. By genetic screen, four sets of transposon insertion mutants displaying aberrant TTSS gene expression were isolated: KB and fin mutants derepress the TTSS genes in rich medium KB and in the presence of a cutin monomer precursor in MM, respectively; min and pin mutants are defective in induction of TTSS genes in MM and in plants, respectively. &#xd;
A putative two-component sensor histidine kinase, RohS, is identified to be required for the induction of avrPto-LUC in MM and in plants. The rohS gene is in an operon containing a two-component response regulator gene rohR. Mutation of rohS in P. s. phaseolicola and P. s. tomato reduced the bacterial pathogenicity on hosts and HR-inducing activity on non-hosts. Our results suggested that RohS acts upstream of HrpR/HrpS. The phosphorylated RohR represses TTSS genes. It is likely that RohS acts as phosphatase of RohR in the TTSS-inducing conditions, and subsequently derepresses TTSS genes.  &#xd;
Simple sugars such as glucose, sucrose and fructose are known to be inducers of the TTSS genes. Isolation of four min mutants defective in fructose-uptake enabled us to study if sugars serve as extracellular signals or as essential nutrients. Our results suggest that fructose acts as an essential nutrient for the activation of type III genes. These mutants slightly compromised induction of avrPto promoter in Arabidopsis and pathogenicity on the host bean plant, but displayed normal HR elicitation on non-host plant tobacco. The reduced pathogenicity suggested that exploitation of fructose from the host tissue is an important means for pathogenesis of P. s. phaseolicola.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Phloem-feeding insects like aphids feed on a variety of crop plants and limit plant productivity.  In addition they are vectors for important plant viruses.  Efforts to enhance plant resistance to aphids have been hampered by lack of sufficient understanding of mechanisms of plant defense against aphids.  I have utilized a plant-aphid system consisting of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the generalist aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer (green peach aphid [GPA]), to study plant response to aphids.  These studies have demonstrated an important role of premature leaf senescence in controlling aphid growth in Arabidopsis.  Molecular and physiological studies suggest that the Arabidopsis PAD4 (PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4) gene modulates the GPA feeding-induced senescence process.  Furthermore, in comparison to the wild type plants, GPA growth was higher on pad4 mutant plants, suggesting an important role for PAD4 in plant defense against GPA.  In contrast, constitutive expression of PAD4 in transgenic Arabidopsis enhanced basal resistance against GPA.  Unlike its involvement in plant defense against pathogens, the role of PAD4 in Arabidopsis resistance to GPA is independent of its involvement in phytoalexin biosynthesis and of its interaction with EDS1, a PAD4-interacting protein. Instead, the heightened resistance to GPA in these PAD4 constitutively expressing plants was associated with the rapid activation of leaf senescence.  The association of premature leaf senescence in basal defense against GPA is supported by our observation that in comparison to the wild type plant, GPA growth was restricted on the Arabidopsis hypersenescence mutants, ssi2 and cpr5. &#xd;
&#xd;
Gene expression studies suggested some overlap between plant responses to pathogens and aphids, for example, activation of genes associated with the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway.  However, the characterization of aphid performance on Arabidopsis SA biosynthesis and signaling mutants have ruled out the involvement of SA signaling in controlling aphid growth.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Decentralized sensor networks are collections of individual local sensors that&#xd;
observe a common phenomenon, quantize their observations, and send this quantized&#xd;
information to a central processor (fusion center) which then makes a global decision&#xd;
about the phenomenon. Most of the existing literature in this field consider only the&#xd;
data fusion aspect of this problem, i.e., the statistical hypothesis testing and optimal combining of the information obtained by the local sensors. In this thesis, we look at both the data detection and the data fusion aspects of the decentralized sensor networks. By data detection, we refer to the communication problem of transmitting quantized information from the local sensors to the fusion center through a multiple access channel.&#xd;
This work first analyzes the data fusion problem in decentralized sensor network when the sensor observations are corrupted by additive white gaussian noise. We optimize both local decision rules and fusion rule for this case. After that, we&#xd;
consider same problem when the observations are corrupted by correlated gaussian noise. We propose a novel parallel genetic algorithm which simultaneously optimizes&#xd;
both the local decision and fusion rules and show that our algorithm matches the results from prior work with considerably less computational cost. We also demonstrate&#xd;
that, irrespective of the fusion rule, the system can provide equivalent performance&#xd;
with an appropriate choice of local decision rules.&#xd;
The second part of this work analyzes the data detection problem in distributed sensor networks. We characterize this problem as a multiple input multiple&#xd;
output (MIMO) system problem, where the local sensors represent the multiple input&#xd;
nodes and the fusion center(s) represent the output nodes. This set up, where the&#xd;
number of input nodes (sensors) is greater than the number of output nodes (fusion&#xd;
center(s)), is known as an overloaded array in MIMO terminology. We use a genetic&#xd;
algorithm to solve this overloaded array problem.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As the number of adoptable infants within the U.S. has declined, many families&#xd;
have chosen to adopt internationally. According to the U.S. Department of State, for the&#xd;
2002 fiscal year 19,139 immigrant visas were issued to orphans coming into the U.S. A&#xd;
majority of these adopted children came from China, South Korea, Romania and Russia.&#xd;
Previous studies have found attachment problems in some adopted populations in early&#xd;
childhood. However, a majority of studies have focused on other problem areas for older&#xd;
adopted children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors associated with&#xd;
attachment in children adopted from these four countries in early childhood.&#xd;
All of the agencies within the U.S. that provided adoption services to these four&#xd;
countries were contacted through letters describing the study. The agencies that agreed to&#xd;
participate contacted potential participants directly through a form letter describing the&#xd;
study and that contained a website address for them to visit. At this website address, the&#xd;
potential participants were asked to fill out a survey regarding their adoption experience.&#xd;
A total of 242 families who had adopted children who were currently between one and&#xd;
six years of age agreed to participate in the study.&#xd;
Results indicated that secure attachments with their adoptive families were more&#xd;
likely in instances where the parenting style was authoritative, there was a positive&#xd;
emotional reaction from the parents on the day of adoption, the parents received strong&#xd;
social support, there were fewer health/developmental problems at arrival for the adopted&#xd;
child, there were fewer health/developmental services needed for the adopted child, the&#xd;
child spent more months in the adoptive home at the time of the survey and the parent&#xd;
spent more time with child before returning to work. Also, results indicated that adopted&#xd;
children displayed more indiscriminately friendly behavior the more months spent in the&#xd;
adoptive home at the time of the survey and the more time the child spent in the&#xd;
institution.&#xd;
The findings of this study support and extend previous research done on this topic&#xd;
while simultaneously opening up new avenues for international adoption research to&#xd;
explore. The findings of this study also provide useful information for adoption agencies&#xd;
to incorporate in their training of social workers and informing parents of the factors&#xd;
associated with developing secure attachments with their internationally adopted&#xd;
children.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Q gene is largely responsible for the widespread cultivation of durum and common wheat because it confers the square spike phenotype and the free-threshing character. It also pleiotropically influences many other domestication related traits such as glume shape, glume tenacity, rachis fragility, spike length, plant height, and spike emergence time.  The objectives of this research were to confirm or reject the hypothesis that a candidate AP2-like gene is Q, confirm the dosage and pleiotropic effects attributed to Q, and begin defining the differences between the Q and q alleles.  The identity of the Q gene was verified by analysis of knockout mutants and found to have a high degree of similarity to members of the AP2 family of transcription factors.  Southern analysis of multiple Triticum taxa containing either Q or q indicated that the Q locus is not composed of duplicated q alleles.  Ectopic expression analysis allowed the observation of both silencing and over-expression effects of Q. Rachis fragility, glume shape, and glume tenacity mimicked the q phenotype in transgenic plants exhibiting transcriptional silencing of the transgene and the endogenous Q gene. Variation in spike compactness and plant height were directly associated with the level of transgene expression due to the dosage effects of Q. Comparisons of Q and q indicated structural differences as well as variation in the level of transcription.   One amino acid difference and several base changes within the promoter were identified as possible critical differences between Q and q.  Very little genetic variability was found within the sequenced Q alleles suggesting it arose only once and that q is the more primitive allele.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We investigate the nonlinear spectroscopy of acetylene in the near infrared region inside a photonic band gap fiber. The near infrared region of the optical spectrum is an area of intensive research due to its relevance to telecommunication and optical metrology. Acetylene provides a large number of reference transitions coincident with the international telecommunication band.  Acetylene contains about 50 strong lines between 1510 nm and 1540 nm in the ν1+ν3 ro-vibrational combination band. We have observed the Doppler-free saturated spectrum of several of these lines. The light from a tunable diode laser at ~1531 nm, resonant with the P(11) transition, is amplified by an erbium doped fiber amplifier and split into a strong pump beam and weak probe beam which counter-propagate inside the gas-filled fiber. The measured Doppler linewidth of the P(11) line at room temperature is about 467 MHz wide. The sub-Doppler profile over a pressure range of 200-1600 mT appears as a narrow absorption feature about 20-40 MHz wide, even at the low pump power of ~10 mW. It is found that for a fiber with an 80 cm length, 20 core size, pumped with 29 mw, the optimum pressure is ~530mT. But the optimum pressure condition will further decrease when the fiber length increases.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to further develop an understanding of the nature of the adaptation process of adult first generation students to the undergraduate college experience.  This study utilized the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ) in conjunction with personal interviews to explore whether first generation adult college students adapt differently to college than do their continuing generation peers and if there is a commonality of experience, across demographic differences, for first generation, adult college students.  Fifty-five adult college freshmen were surveyed using the SACQ.  From this sample, sixteen first generation volunteers were interviewed regarding their college experience.  	&#xd;
	T-test analysis of the SACQ scores showed that the first generation students were not adjusting to college as well as their continuing generation peers on the overall measure to adjustment and on three of the four subscales.  The personal interviews indicated that while there was variation in the first generation students’ adaptation with seven of the sixteen volunteers classified as adjusting poorly to college, three with mixed adjustment, and five with good adjustment, there were also commonalities in the students’ experience, regardless how well they were adjusting to college.  Eleven meta themes emerged from the interview data, and these themes correlated with characteristics of nonpersisters as compiled by Kasworm, Polson, and Fishback (2002).&#xd;
	This research indicated that further investigation into adult first generation college students is appropriate especially with regard to how these adults view themselves as role models.  In addition, this study indicates a need for future research into the links between adult students’ first generation status and persistence problems in their college experience.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Analysis of transcriptomes from salivary glands and midgut of the Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] identified a diverse set of cDNAs that were categorized into five groups, group I – V, based on their phylogenetic relationship. All five of these groups may encode putative protease inhibitors based on structural similarity with known proteins. The sequences of these putative proteins among different groups are highly diversified. However, sequence identity and structural analysis of the proteins revealed that all of them contained high cysteine residues that were completely conserved at their respective positions among these otherwise diversified proteins. Analysis of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA for two groups, group I (11A6) and group II (14A4), indicated that group I might be a single copy gene or genes with low copy number whereas group II exists as multiple copies clustered within the Hessian fly genome. To test the inhibitory activity and specificity of these putative proteins, recombinant proteins were generated. Enzymatic analysis of the recombinant proteins against commercial and insect gut proteases demonstrated that recombinant proteins indeed are strong inhibitors of proteases with different specificities. Northern analysis of the representative members of five groups revealed that the group I-IV genes were expressed exclusively in the larval stage with variations among groups at different larval stages. The group V (11C4) genes were expressed in the late larval and pupal stage. Tissue specific gene expression analysis revealed that group I-IV genes were predominantly expressed in malpighian tubules whereas the group V genes were abundantly expressed in the salivary glands. Localization experiments with the antibody for representative members from group II (14A4) demonstrated that the protein was predominantly localized in the malpighian tubules and in low amounts in the midgut, suggesting that malpighian tubules are the primary tissue of 14A4 inhibitor synthesis. The overall results indicated that the Hessian fly contains a complex network of genes that code for protease inhibitors which regulate protease activities through different developmental stages of the insect.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The components of the O2 transport pathway can be divided into (along with their respective circulations) the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle systems. They must operate in tight conjunction with one another, especially during dynamic exercise, to sustain ATP production within muscle mitochondria.  Any limitation placed on the O2 transport pathway will result in decreased performance.  The purpose of this dissertation is to present four novel studies which examine specific limitations on (1) the pulmonary system (i.e. lungs and circulation) within the highly athletic Thoroughbred horse (Studies A &amp; B), and (2) within the peripheral circulation (i.e. microcirculation) within a disease model of Type II diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat (Studies C &amp; D).  Study A demonstrates that locomotory respiratory coupling (LRC) is not requisite for the horse to achieve maximal minute ventilation (VE) during galloping exercise because VE remains at the peak exercising levels over the first ~13 s of trotting recovery (VE at end exercise: 1391±88; VE at 13 s: 1330±112 L/sec; P > 0.05).  The horse also experiences exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) which has been linked mechanistically to increased pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) during high intensity exercise.  Therefore, in Study B, we hypothesized that endothelin-1 (ET-1), a powerful vasoconstricting hormone, would play a role in the augmented Ppa and therefore, EIPH.  However, contrary to our hypothesis, an ET-1 receptor antagonist did not decrease Ppa nor prevent or reduce EIPH.  Studies C and D examine potential mechanisms behind the exercise intolerance observed in humans with Type II diabetes.  Utilizing phosphorescence quenching techniques (Study C) within the GK spinotrapezius muscle, we found lowered microvascular PO2 (PO2mv; Control: 28.8±2.0; GK: 18.4±1.8 mmHg; P&lt;0.05) at rest and a PO2mv “undershoot” during muscle contractions.  After conducting intravital microscopy within the same muscle (Study D), we discovered the percentage of RBC-perfused capillaries was decreased (Control: 93±3; GK: 66±5 %; P&lt;0.05) and all three major hemodynamic variables (i.e. RBC velocity, flux, and capillary tube hematocrit) were significantly attenuated.  Both studies (C &amp; D) indicate that there is reduced O2 availability (via decreased O2 delivery; i.e. ↓QO2/VO2) within Type II diabetic muscle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There is growing concern over the academic performance of student athletes in today’s institutions of higher education. Across all media, the public is constantly reminded that the success rate of student athletes is not what it should be.  One hypothesis for this poor performance is that athletes are not as well prepared to go to college as their non-athletic counterparts. This could be attributed to low high school academic standards, or high school teachers allowing athletes to underperform due to their status as an athlete, or a lack of time for studying due to sport participation.  The NCAA mandates certain academic standards for entrance into college, yet athletes still struggle to maintain passing grades, with some failing to graduate.  Most college students are admitted to college based on their potential to benefit from an institution’s programs and educational opportunities.  In many institutions, especially at the Division I level, student athletes are admitted for their potential to provide benefits for the institutions.  This study compared the college graduating GPA of athletes and nonathletes relative to ACT score to determine if athletes were underperforming in college.  Additionally the effect of gender, ethnicity and type of sport was examined. This study used hierarchical regression equations to examine these effects.  When looking at athletes only, type of sport, gender, and ethnicity had very little influence on graduating GPA.  When examining all students, ACT test scores were significantly related to college graduating GPA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Little is known about nightly activity patterns of nocturnal small mammals under natural conditions, and how these activity patterns might be affected by photoperiod, season, and sex, age, and reproductive status of individuals. The main objectives of this research were: 1) to find an appropriate method for marking individual deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) so that their activity could be monitored remotely; 2) to design a portable activity-monitoring system to investigate temporal patterns of shelter use by deer mice under natural conditions; 3) to determine the influence of environmental conditions such as photoperiod and season on nightly activity of deer mice; and 4) to compare effects of demographic or physiological factors such as sex, age, and reproductive status on nightly activity of deer mice at artificial burrows in tallgrass prairie. In general, commencement of activity was correlated positively with timing of sunset, and time of retirement to the burrow was correlated positively with sunrise. Among adults, males first emerged from the burrow earlier and made more trips of shorter duration in a night than did females, although total duration of trips was similar. Return visits and subsequent stays typically were shorter for males than females, but total time spent in the burrow and retirement time relative to sunrise were similar for both sexes. Young deer mice emerged significantly later, made more trips of shorter duration, spent less total time outside, and retired to their burrow earlier than adults. Reproductive females emerged later, made fewer trips of generally longer duration, and spent shorter total amounts of time away from the burrow each night than non-reproductive females. Return visits of reproductive females were of longer duration than non-reproductives, but total time spent inside and time of retirement for the night did not differ relative to reproductive status. From parturition through lactation, activity of females showed a number of directional trends. Results suggest that under natural conditions, activity patterns of deer mice are highly variable but responsive to both the changing physical environment and internal conditions related to sex-specific maximization of fitness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This phenomenological study explored horticultural students’ intellectual development as defined by William Perry’s Scheme. Perry’s theory of intellectual development helps describe the progression in college student thinking from simple to complex. These patterns of development act as filters through which a student ascribes meaning to their world. The objectives of this study were to: 1) explore the reliability of using the Learning Environment Preference Inventory (LEP) instrument’s Cognitive Complexity Indicator (CCI) scores as a tool to recognize the positions of cognitive complexity of horticultural students, the nature of this complexity and if gender, age, class status, or previous horticultural experience would influence CCI scores; 2) determine if specific teaching methods designed to promote active involvement at a higher level of exchange than lecture might influence scores; 3) describe the effects of the collaborative interactions with classmates and instructor; 4) determine whether student journals would reveal changes in their cognitive complexity or perception of learning as a result of their learning environment and; 5) discover other significant issues that could produce advancement along the Perry scale. Students in this study began their experiences no lower than Perry position two and ranged as high as position four. The initial CCI scores affirmed that many upper-division horticultural students were still operating in Perry positions two and three. Analysis of the interviews revealed: 1) that instructor techniques may positively or negatively influence individual students ideal learning environment; 2) there are significant issues that influence student ideal learning environments; 3) learning is viewed as the responsibility of the instructor, and; 4) students prefer hands-on learning. The students CCI scores did not show upward movement as a direct result of collaborative learning, although the voices of several students expressed both benefits and drawbacks of this type of learning. Journal writing did not reveal any changes in students’ level of thinking or perception of learning but they did reveal other aspects of student learning and attitudes. An understanding of Perry’s Scheme helped the researcher to recognize that student perspective, behavior, and performance is conditioned more by the students’ cognitive complexity than by peer interaction or by teaching methodology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was an investigation of mission, vision, funding strategies, and student&#xd;
services for distance learning as expressed by university administrators in land grant universities&#xd;
and state universities, and those institutions that are designated as both land grant and state&#xd;
universities by the state legislature. Three research questions guided the study&#xd;
The study employed a survey distributed through e-mail. The questionnaire was sent to&#xd;
261 senior administrators; the chief academic officers, chief business officers, and chief&#xd;
information officers in 37 land grant and state universities and 13 institutions that are both land&#xd;
grant and state universities. The return rate was 30%.&#xd;
The institutional mission and administrator’s vision for offering distance learning survey&#xd;
responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study also used correlation, confirmed&#xd;
by factor analysis, to determine if there was a relationship among the administrators’ responses&#xd;
regarding mission, vision, and funding. The data were analyzed with ANOVA and fishers least&#xd;
means difference test. These tests determined if there were differences in the administrators’&#xd;
responses between the type or sizes of higher education institutions on mission, vision of&#xd;
administrators. The data analysis indicated that the type of institution did not yield significant&#xd;
differences. The difference of means test indicated there were differences in the student&#xd;
population size of the institutions.&#xd;
The responses indicated the mission or purpose for offering distance learning was to save&#xd;
money for the institution, and support degree completion for former students. The responses&#xd;
related to administrative vision show initiating a distance learning program and a being leader&#xd;
among higher education institutions were the reasons for a distance learning program.  The content analysis method was employed to determine the roles of the administrators in&#xd;
the survey. The administrators’ responses related to distance learning were consistent with their&#xd;
roles in the institution.&#xd;
The study also produced results related to student services institutions provide for&#xd;
distance learning students, how the student services were provided, on or off campus or both&#xd;
locations and the funding sources for the student services.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research explores the challenges related to the visual image of a city situated in a developing country. Originated as the colonial capital of British India, Kolkata faces new urban challenges in the post colonial world. This report intends to answer questions of imageability of the city as relevant to the Third World countries. Empathizing on the issues of scarcity of land, traffic congestion, accumulation of the urban poor, inadequacies in infrastructure and the organic expansion of fluid city boundaries under the neo-ideological globalization and liberal economic policies – Kolkata faces a host of urban problems. Imageability of the city usually tries to define the positive image of a city. The question here is, should the notions of imageability be confined to cities that inherently have succeeded in maintaining an appealing public image or should it be applied to the potential qualities of visual appropriateness to cities that have historically remained unattractive?&#xd;
&#xd;
This research intends to explore the visual quality of an area surrounding the five point intersection at Shyambazar, Kolkata, India.  This study will be based on a number of observations and the different visual analysis techniques applicable in critically analyzing the visual conditions of an urban street pattern of a megacity in India.  The main objective of this study is to find an appropriate visual quality for Kolkata, a megacity in the tropics – considering various related factors like – historical significance, demographic trends, geographical and climatological influences, transportation pattern, existing land use, socio-economic structure and inherent or associated urban problems of planning in developing nations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research explores the bioclimatic and socio-cultural benefits of Kolkata’s courtyard houses. A typological and historical analysis of courtyard houses from around the world, as well as in Kolkata, provides a context for the field research. &#xd;
&#xd;
The main intention of this study is to explore the roles of solar shading and natural ventilation in courtyard houses located in the hot-humid climatic region. For this purpose interviews with the heads of household of ten courtyard houses in Kolkata were conducted in January 2005, to finally choose three houses for detailed experimental analysis. All three houses have high thermal construction and similar socio-economic conditions. This helped in comparing the results of the temperature (both ambient and surface temperatures) and air speed measurements among the three houses referred to as House A, House B and House C houses. House A and House C houses have shallow courtyards (high aspect ratios which in both cases equal 0.95), while House B house has a deep courtyard (low aspect ratio equal to 0.21). Further, ventilation analysis has been done with the help of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation study and the experimental data measurements focused on the comfort conditions generated within the house based on their differences in proportion of form and massing. The effects of solar shading and natural ventilation on activity patterns and uses of a space are also examined through occupant surveys. &#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, this research explores the historic courtyard houses in Kolkata, with a view to address the benefits of the universal courtyard form of design and speculate the appropriateness of the vernacular courtyard form in the modern architectural arena of Kolkata.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A large scale habitat manipulation was conducted to assess the effects of establishing an emergent macrophyte, American water willow Justicia americana, on littoral reservoir communities. Coves in three large (>1,800 ha) Kansas impoundments were chosen and half planted with water willow. Sampling was conducted during the summer from 2001 to 2004. I found that water willow coves had more complex habitat as well as higher abundance and diversity of fishes, macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton than control coves. However, strong temporal variation in water levels influenced the amount of inundated water willow available in these systems. The effects of water willow on density, growth, condition, and diet of age-0 largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were assessed. Significantly higher densities of age-0 largemouth bass were found in water willow coves, but growth, condition, and diet did not differ between water willow and control coves. Therefore, water willow was able to support higher abundances of age-0 largemouth bass than control coves without affecting growth, condition, or diet. Characteristics of age-0 largemouth bass from the water willow coves were compared to those from two small impoundments (&lt;80 ha) with abundant macrophyte and healthy largemouth bass populations. Small impoundments had higher densities of age-0 largemouth bass than water willow coves in the three large impoundments, but individuals on average also had lower growth, condition, and fewer fish in their diet. Thus, largemouth bass populations in small impoundments may be more regulated by density dependent factors than populations in large impoundments. Overall, water&#xd;
willow is beneficial to littoral areas, supporting an increase in both abundance and diversity of assemblages. Finally, I used a field experiment to test the inundation and desiccation tolerance of water willow for different depths and durations. Water willow was susceptible to inundation, but resistant to desiccation. My findings provide information that can be used to select candidate reservoirs for water willow establishment based on expected water-level fluctuations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The calculation of reliability based on running test cases refers to the  probability of the software not generating faulty output consequent to the testing process. The metric used to measure this reliability is referred in terms of E(Θ) value. The concept of E(Θ) gives precise formulae to calculate the probability of failure of software after testing, debug or operational. This report aims at extending the functionalities of E(Θ) into the realm of multiple faults spread across multiple sub-domains. This generalization involves introduction of a new set of formulae for E(Θ) calculation which can account for faults spread over both single as well as multiple sub-domains in a code. The validity of the formulae is verified by matching the obtained theoretical results against the empirical data generated from running a test case simulator. The report further examines the possibility of an upper bound calculation on the derived formulae and its possible ramifications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Wireless broadband communications is a rapidly growing industry. New enabling technologies such as multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) are shaping the future of wireless systems. However, research efforts in improving MC-CDMA receiver performance&#xd;
have received limited attention and there is a need for innovative receiver designs for next generation MC-CDMA. In this thesis, we propose novel multi-user detection (MUD) schemes to enhance the performance of both synchronous and asynchronous MC-CDMA. First, we adapt the ant colony optimization (ACO) approach to solve the optimal MUD problem in MC-CDMA systems. Our simulations indicate that the ACO based MUD converges to the optimal BER performance in relatively few iterations providing more that 95% savings in computational complexity. Second, we propose a new MUD structure specifically for asynchronous MC-CDMA. Previously proposed MUDs for asynchronous MC-CDMA perform the detection for one user (desired user) at a time, mandating multiple runs of the algorithm to detect all users' symbols. In this thesis, for the first time we present a MUD structure that detects all users' symbols simultaneously in one run by extending the receiver's integration window to capture the energy scattered in two consecutive symbol durations. We derive the optimal, decorrelator and minimum mean square error (MMSE) MUD for the extended window case. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed MUD structures not only perform similar to a MUD that detects one user at a time, but its computational complexity is significantly lower. Finally, we extend the MUD ideas to multicarrier implementation of single carrier systems. Specifically, we employ the novel MUD structure as a multi-symbol detection scheme in CI-CDMA and illustrate the resulting performance gain via simulations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated the effects of new teacher induction programs on feelings of burnout of 69 newly hired special education teachers from two Midwestern, metropolitan school districts.  The central research question was whether there was a significant difference in feelings of burnout between new teachers in a district that uses a special education instructional resource teacher as a key feature of their induction program and teachers in a district that uses a more traditional induction model.  Participants’ scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory – Educators Survey provided the dependent measures.  There were, on average, no statistically significant differences (p &lt; .05) in feelings of burnout of newly hired special education teachers in the two school districts.   There were, on average, no statistically significant differences between the two groups.  These findings suggest that, at least in these districts, special education teachers are staying in the field longer than originally expected, newly hired special education teachers are coming to the job better prepared, and deliberate and responsive induction programs did not influence feelings of burnout.  The influence of participant demographic characteristics, particularly the amount of experience and licensure status, is discussed.  Implications of these findings for special education teacher induction programs are suggested.  Among these are the examination of supports from various sources, the availability of resources, and the structure of the induction program itself to meet the needs of more experienced teachers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Traditionally, major-league scouts have evaluated young “position players,” those who are not pitchers, using the “Five Tools”: hitting for average, hitting for power, running, throwing, and fielding.  However, “sabermetricians,” those who study the science of baseball, e.g. Bill James, have been trying to evaluate position players using quantifiable measures of performance.  In this study, a factor analysis was used to determine underlying characteristics of minor-league hitters.  The underlying factors were determined to be slugging ability, lead-off hitting ability, “patience” at the plate, and pure-hitting ability.  Additionally, an ordinal response was created from the number of at-bats and on-base plus slugging percentage in the majors during the 2002-05 seasons.  The underlying characteristics along with other variables such as a player’s age, position, and level in the minors are used in a cumulative logit logistic regression model to predict a player’s probability of notable success in the majors.  The model is built upon data from the 2002 minor-league season and data from the 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 major-league seasons.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by an enveloped, positive-stranded &#xd;
RNA virus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).  Coronaviruses along with the arteriviruses are placed in the order, Nidovirales.  Even though nidovirus replication is restricted to the cytoplasm, the nucleocapsid protein (N) of several coronaviruses and arteriviruses, localize to the nucleolus during infection.  Confocal microscopy of N protein localization in Vero cells infected with the SARS-CoV or transfected with the SARS-CoV N gene failed to show presence of N in the nucleoplasm or nucleolus.  Recombinant N remained cytoplasmic after the addition of leptomycin B (LMB), a drug that inhibits nuclear export.  SARS-CoV N possesses a unique lysine-rich domain, located between amino acids 369-389, which possesses several nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) motifs. A chimeric protein composed of the 369-389 peptide substituted for the NLS of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Rev protein (ERev) showed no nuclear localization activity.  Three negatively charged amino acids, located at positions 372, 377 and 379 in SARS-CoV N were hypothesized to play a role in the loss of nuclear targeting.  Substitution of aspartic acid-372 with alanine restored nuclear localization to the chimeric protein. A full-length recombinant SARS-N protein with the alanine-372 substitution localized to the nucleus. Therefore, the presence of an aspartic acid at position 372 is sufficient to retain N in the cytoplasm  The mechanistic basis for how aspartic acid-372 interrupts nuclear transport is unknown, but may lie in the electrostatic repulsion with negatively charged amino acids located within the NLS binding pocket of importin-alpha.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of student attitudes in a college algebra mathematics classroom when lessons are primarily composed of standards-based pedagogy. National reports advocate for a change in teaching K-12.  Nowhere is this more needed than in community colleges where students are taught in traditional formats and rarely challenged to make connections between mathematics and their personal experiences. A thorough review of the literature shows the need for mathematics reform at every level, including the college mathematics classroom. There are several national reports, Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, Adding it Up, How People Learn, and Undergraduate Programs and Courses in the Mathematical Sciences, that have been published to address the need to change mathematics teaching and learning. They are advocates for the implementation of standards-based instruction into the mathematics classroom.&#xd;
This study focused on students’ perceptions about the nature of mathematics and learning mathematics, specifically, does such a learning environment impact students’ perceptions of being a student of mathematics in the areas of confidence, anxiety, enjoyment, and motivation, and relevance of mathematics in personal and professional experiences. Over the course of one semester, two sections of college algebra students participated in the study. By using both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, the study was able to see if there was an impact in student attitudes toward mathematics. The standards-based pedagogy used in this study was cooperative learning, problem solving, discourse, and the graphing calculator. Changes in attitude were determined by attitudinal surveys, student questionnaires, observations, and focus groups. College algebra students had a statistically significant change in their enjoyment of mathematics. Although the other attitudes, confidence, motivation, and value did not have a statistically significant change, the qualitative data indicates a change in these attitudes did occur. This study identified that cooperative learning, problem-solving, discourse, and graphing calculators increased student confidence in doing mathematics because they felt more competent in working problems on exams. Students also found the class enjoyable, anxiety was reduced as students became more familiar with the instructional strategies, and students recognized the value of mathematics for job skills and personal business.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The blending of small percentages of organic cotton has been a successful way for apparel manufacturers to introduce organic cotton into their supply chain.  However, little is known on how consumers perceive small percentage blended organic cotton apparel products.&#xd;
The purpose of this study was twofold.  One goal was to identify the groups of consumers who might be interested in buying blended organic cotton clothes and find out what kind of labeling they preferred.  The second goal was to find out more about the consumer’s attitudes and interest in purchasing the organic cotton clothing.  Theory in consumer behavior, and social psychology provided the conceptual framework for the study.  Major variables included in the study were environmental attitudes, attitudes of the consumers and important other people towards organic cotton clothing, skepticism toward environmental product claims, consumer self-identity, and future purchase intention.&#xd;
Data were collected with a mail survey of consumers, stratified by state population, that was randomly drawn from a national mailing list of health and natural foods consumers (usable response rate=14.9%, n=422).  Factor analysis uncovered latent variables from among the large number of items.  Conjoint analysis revealed which product attributes were salient and cluster analysis identified segments of consumers with different attribute preferences.  Finally, multiple regression analysis was used to examine the causal relationships among variables affection future purchase intention. &#xd;
Percentage of organic cotton content, price, and labeling for fairly traded fibers and donations to cancer research were all attributes used by the consumers to decide how likely the would be to purchase an organic cotton t-shirt.  Two segments of consumers (53%) used the percentage of organic cotton more than any other attribute to decide their purchase likelihood.  Results from the multiple regression were used to make a model of socially responsible consumer behavior.&#xd;
The research makes numerous contributions.  Apparel manufacturers will benefit from knowing that seeing even small percentages of organic fiber helps consumers decide to purchase organic clothing.  Theoretical contributions include the determination that the relationship between future purchase intention and both self-identity and the personal norm is mediated by the consumers’ evaluation of outcomes of the purchase.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The three experiments described below offer support of immune function by the swine gastrointestinal epithelium.  Experiment one evaluated mediators that regulate the movement of macrophages (macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MIF), neutrophils (interleukin 8; IL8), dendritic cells (CC chemokine ligand 20; CCL20) and epithelial remodeling (osteopontin; OPN) in pigs challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) or Choleraesuis (SC).  The proximal ileum had greater IL8 expression than the distal ileum (P &lt; 0.05), and ST increased CCL20 (P &lt; 0.05).  In vitro, MIF, IL8, CCL20 and OPN mRNA expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ST or SC using pig jejunal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) resulted in increased IL8 secretion, and increased IL8 and CCL20 mRNA by ST and SC (P &lt; 0.05).  Experiment two evaluated how Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) and Bacillus licheniformis (BL) differed from ST or SC in their ability to regulate, stimulate, or modify IL8, CCL20, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in IPEC-J2 cells.  ST stimulated an increase in IL8 secretion, with increases in IL8 mRNA (P &lt; 0.05).  BL increased IL8 mRNA (P &lt; 0.0001).  CCL20 mRNA was upregulated by ST (P &lt; 0.05) and BL (P &lt; 0.05).  Only ST increased TNFα mRNA (P &lt; 0.05).   Another objective evaluated whether pre-exposure of IPEC-J2 cells to LR or BL modified ST induced IL8 secretion.  IL8 secretion was increased by ST (P &lt; 0.0001), and reduced by LR (P &lt; 0.05).   Only the BL/ST co-treated wells blunted basolateral IL8 secretion (P &lt; 0.0001).  Experiment three characterized the swine CCL20 mRNA sequence and evaluated tissue expression.  Cloning of CCL20 from the porcine jejunum predicted a 97 amino acid peptide.  All healthy tissues expressed CCL20 mRNA.  In animals challenged with Salmonella spp., SC increased spleen and liver CCL20 expression.  The data demonstrate that invasive bacterial pathogens in the pig gastrointestinal tract trigger upregulation of selected proinflammatory mediators; Salmonella spp. elicited differing patterns of activation in vitro and in vivo; IPEC-J2 cells increased IL-8 secretion in response to ST and BL, but not LR, while ST stimulated secretion was inhibited basolaterally by BL pre-exposure; and numerous porcine tissues are prominent sources CCL20.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Toll-like receptors (TLR) are instrumental in discriminating between pathogenic and commensal bacteria and act as mediators, along with downstream chemokines, of subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses.  However, little is known about the expression and regulation of TLR or chemokines in swine.  The objectives of the experiments described herein were to characterize the expression of porcine TLR and to identify regulatory patterns in these receptors in the presence of live Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) or Choleraesuis (SC).  The first two experiments evaluated the in vivo and in vitro expression of TLR2, 4, 5 and 9. Our results indicate that TLR2, 4, 5 and 9 are constitutively expressed in vitro in a porcine jejunal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2), porcine mononuclear phagocytes (pMPs) and in vivo in the distal ileum.  In IPEC-J2 cells, ST elicited an increase in TLR2 mRNA (P &lt; 0.05), and both ST and SC increased TLR2 mRNA in pMPs (P &lt; 0.05).  In vivo, oral challenge with ST increased (P &lt; 0.05) both TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA in the distal ileum.  In addition, the second experiment evaluated interleukin 8 (IL8) and CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) expression in IPEC-J2 cells in response to ST or purified bacterial flagellin (Flag).  TLR5 was constitutively expressed in the ileum and in IPEC-J2 and pMP cells.  Interestingly, IL8 and CCL20 mRNA and protein were increased (P &lt; 0.05) by ST and Flag, even in the absence of changes in TLR5.  In the third experiment, the expression of TLR and chemoattractive mediators were evaluated in a panel of tissues obtained from pigs challenged with ST and SC.  All genes of interest were constitutively expressed; however, the effects of treatment were limited to isolated tissues and genes.  Taken together, the data indicate that TLR and chemoattractive mediators are expressed in porcine tissues and cells and that the observations described represent novel evidence that pig pathogens may regulate TLR expression and activate chemokine secretion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Salivary secretions are a key component of aphid-plant interactions. Aphids’ salivary proteins interact with plant tissues, gaining access to phloem sap and eliciting responses which may benefit the insect. In an effort to isolate and identify key components in salivary secretions, we created a salivary gland cDNA library. Several thousand randomly selected cDNA clones were sequenced. We grouped these sequences into 1769 sets of essentially identical sequences, or clusters. About 22% of the clusters matched clearly to (non-aphid) proteins of known function. Among our cDNAs, we have identified putative oxido-reductases and hydrolases that may be involved in the insect's attack on plant tissue. C002 represents an abundant transcript among the genes expressed in the salivary glands. This cDNA encodes a novel protein that fails to match to proteins outside of aphids and is of unknown function. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localized C002 in the same sub-set of cells within the principal salivary gland. C002 protein was detected in fava beans that were exposed to aphids, verifying that C002 protein is a secreted protein. Injection of siC002-RNA caused depletion of C002 transcript levels dramatically over a 3 day period after injection. With a lag of 1 – 2 days, the siC002-RNA injected insects died, on average 8 days before the death of control insects injected with siRNA for green fluorescent protein. It appears, therefore, that siRNA injections of adults will be a useful tool in studying the roles of individual transcripts in aphid salivary glands.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation will examine the fabrication of different phosphorus containing films and their use as corrosion preventative films and adhesion materials between polymers and metal and metal alloys.  Orthophosphate films are used in several metals and metal alloys to prevent corrosion and promote adhesion between paints or polymers and metal substrates.  One key component is to examine the use of different phosphorus containing acids that might lead to phosphorus containing films which would compliment the mainly orthophosphate films currently in use. &#xd;
The objectives of this study are to see if it is possible to fabricate different  phosphorus containing films, use them to adhere polymers to metal and metal alloys, and test the phosphorus containing films’ and polymer films’ corrosion protection properties. The thermoplastic resin, Poly(ether ketone ketone), or PEKK was found to adhere well to different phosphorus containing films and protect the underlying layers from oxidation in 4-D water.&#xd;
The phosphorus containing films were created by electrochemical deposition in different 5 M phosphorus containing acids.  The metal or metal alloy was abraded to remove the native oxide and treated in the electrochemical cell.  The second, separate polymer films were created by dip coating the metal or metal alloy in a polymer solution.  The film thickness in both cases was controlled to be less than 100Å to ensure that the underlying metal or metal alloy could be detected.&#xd;
The surface chemical analysis was collected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, or XPS.  Core level and valence band XPS were used to distinguish the differences in the chemistry at the surfaces.  The valence band XPS spectra were interpreted using spectra generated by multiple scattered wave calculations and band structure calculations.  In the cases were more than one film was present subtraction and addition spectrum were used to interpret the chemistry in the interface region of the films.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objective of the thesis is to provide a fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM)&#xd;
tool, T2STR, which enables quantitative understanding and prediction of thermal as well as mechanical effects on flow in the porous media under multiphase conditions. This is achieved by incorporating a finite element based hydro-thermo-mechanical stress capability into the well-established IFDM (Integrated Finite Difference Method) based flow simulation code TOUGH2. TOUGH2 is a program for calculation of multi-phase,&#xd;
multi-component, non-isothermal flow in porous media. It implements several equation of state modules to represent different fluid mixtures.&#xd;
The dual mesh technique is natural for combining both discretization methods and is used innovatively and effectively. A generalized approach is developed to accommodate the switching of variables implemented in TOUGH2 to adapt the phase changes. The forward coupling is achieved by using the thermal, hydrostatic, and poroelastic effects in the stress calculations. The backward coupling includes the effect of strain on the fluid flow. T2STR also allows the user to study the variation in porosity, permeability and capillary&#xd;
pressure as function of mean effective stress in the porous media. Multiple materials can&#xd;
be used to model the reservoir in T2STR, parallel to the implementation in TOUGH2.&#xd;
T2STR is implemented to carry out as a fully coupled, one way coupled (only deformation as function of hydro-thermal effects), or original TOUGH2 implementation. It provides the ability to switch on and off the thermal and/or poroelastic effects. &#xd;
T2STR is developed to model the fractured porous media using discrete fractures. The modeling of fractured porous media is limited to a staggered coupling approach. The fluid parameters like permeability, porosity are modified based on the stresses and/or aperture changes due to deformation. &#xd;
A set of verification problems, used to validate the code and display the capabilities of the code, are discussed. A graphical user interface is designed to pre-process the necessary data. Macros are developed for excel and Tecplot to post-process the results for easy visualization.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We used a total of fifty-nine gilts (BW=137.7 kg) from three different breeding groups were used to assess the effects of feeding L-carnitine during gestation on gilt growth characteristics, gilt and fetal blood metabolites, litter characteristics, and IGF axis components in fetal hepatic and skeletal muscle, maternal uterine and chorioallantois tissues, and porcine embryonic myoblasts collected from fetuses.  Experimental treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement with main effects of L-carnitine and day of gestation.  Gilts were fed a constant feed allowance of 1.75 kg/d and a top-dress containing either 0 or 50 ppm of L-carnitine starting on the first day of breeding through the allotted gestation length (40, 55, or 70).  No differences (P > 0.16) were observed for BW or estimated protein or fat mass at any gestation length.  Gilts fed L-carnitine tended to have greater (P = 0.10) backfat at d 40 and were numerically heavier at d 70 compared to control gilts.  No differences (P > 0.77) were observed in circulating total and free carnitine at breeding, but concentrations increased (P &lt; 0.01) as gestation length increased for the gilts fed L-carnitine compared to those fed the control diet.  Fetuses from the gilts fed L-carnitine tended to be heavier (P = 0.06) and fetal circulating IGF-II lower (P = 0.09) at day 70 compared to the fetuses from the control gilts.  Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mRNA was lower (P = 0.05) in fetal hepatic tissue in fetuses collected from gilts fed supplemental L-carnitine.  Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3; P = 0.05) and IGFBP-5 mRNA increased (P = 0.01) and IGF-I mRNA numerically increased (P = 0.16) in the endometrium of gilts supplemented with L-carnitine.  At d 55 or 70 gestation, fetuses were removed for collection of porcine embryonic myoblasts (PEM) from the semitendinosus.  There were no treatment differences (P > 0.10) for the expression of IGF-I, IGF-II or IGFBP-5 mRNA levels.  However, PEM isolated from fetuses collected from gilts fed L-carnitine had lower (P = 0.08) IGFBP-3 mRNA levels compared to the controls.  Myoblasts isolated from fetuses obtained from gilts fed L-carnitine had greater (P = 0.09; 8.8 %) 5.1H11 monoclonal antibody attachment after 72 h in culture.  Although not significant (P = 0.20), the total number of PEM in the S phase of the cell cycle was 4.7 % greater in PEM collected from fetuses from gilts fed L-carnitine compared to the controls.  This study shows L-carnitine supplementation to gestating gilts has beneficial effects on average fetal weight, due in part to changes in the expression of the IGF axis at the fetal-maternal interface in swine. These changes in the IGF axis play a fundamental role in porcine fetal growth and development due to enhanced proliferation and delayed differentiation of PEM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is an account of the synthesis of several drastically different forms of silver&#xd;
nanoparticles: Bare metal nanoparticles, dry nanoparticulate powders, aqueous soluble particles, and organic ligand coated monodisperse silver nanoparticles were all produced. The synthetic method was adapted from previous studies on gold nanoparticles and investigated to understand the optimal conditions for silver nanoparticle synthesis. Also the procedure for refinement of the nanoparticles was studied and applied to the formation of alloy nanoparticles. This extraordinary procedure produces beautifully colored colloids of spherical metal nanoparticles of the highest quality which under suitable conditions self-assemble into extensive three dimensional&#xd;
superlattice structures. The silver nanoparticle products were later tested against several biological pathogens to find dramatic increases in antimicrobial potency in comparison to commercially available silver preparations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Enteric pathogens are responsible for major economic losses in the swine industry. In the U.S., Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) and serovar Choleraesuis (SC) account for essentially all cases of salmonellosis in swine. Previous studies documented that oral ST eroded growth and produced unmistakable changes in the endocrine stress and somatotropic axis of young growing pigs. However, these effects occurred in the absence of elevated systemic inflammatory cytokines that were previously thought to accompany disease-associated growth retardation. In the current study, it was hypothesized that SC would produce very different systemic inflammatory cytokine responses compared to ST given the likelihood of SC to produce systemic disease in pigs. Weaned pigs were housed two per pen with free access to feed and water during a 14 d experiment. On d 0, pigs were fed either 108 CFU SC or 108 ST, and bacteria were re-fed twice weekly through the course of the experiment. Control pigs were fed dough without bacteria. Serum was collected on d 0, 7, and 14 for determination of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±), interleukin-1beta (IL-1Î²), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were determined. Rectal temperatures (RT) were monitored daily beginning 2 d prior to challenge with bacteria and until 7 d following the first bacterial feeding. Pigs were weighed initially, and at the conclusion of the study. Daily body weight gain was reduced by 25.4% in pigs fed SC (P&lt;.0001) compared to control, while growth was similar between control pigs and those fed ST. Pigs fed SC had increased RT beginning on d 2 and continuing though d 7 (P &lt; 0.05) with the greatest elevation spike on d 3 (P &lt; 0.001) when compared to controls. On d 7, pigs fed SC had reduced IGF-I when compared to both control (P &lt; 0.01) and ST pigs (P = 0.01). Despite the obvious&#xd;
febrile response, and the reductions in body weight gain and serum IGF-I, circulating TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² were not affected by treatment. It was concluded that elevated TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² are not obligatory correlates of SC-induced pathology and growth retardation in weaned pigs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Preventing foodborne illness and promoting safe food practices among all age groups is a high priority, particularly for college students because little about their food safety awareness and food handling practices has been reported.&#xd;
     The research aim was to evaluate food safety attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, and self-reported practices of current upper-division college students, and to determine whether a three-module interactive educational intervention, developed for this study, positively influenced these variables.  Comparisons between health and non-health majors were made. &#xd;
     Two methods of data collection were used with volunteer health and non-health majors: focused food safety discussion groups during academic year 2004-05, and a pre-experimental design.  Prior to engaging in either method, students completed an on-line food safety questionnaire (FSQ), adapted from a telephone survey used at K-State with older adults.  The FSQ was administered again to those in the pre-experimental design group one week after exposure to the food safety educational intervention.  Five weeks later, the FSQ was administered to determine whether changes in attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, and self-reported practices persisted over time.  Focused food safety discussion group responses were qualitatively evaluated.  Pre-experimental statistical analyses included Wilcoxin Signed Rank, Friedman, Mann-Whitney U, Chi Square tests, and Spearman rho.  &#xd;
     Focused discussion group findings indicated that students perceived themselves at low risk for foodborne illness; few used food thermometers; students without health backgrounds mimicked undesirable home practices; and students stated being open to changing non-recommended behaviors.  Pre-experimental findings showed the effects of intervention were improved food safety attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge, with the strongest effects seen in health majors.  Students' FSQ attitude scores increased from 114 to 122 (P&lt;0.001), FSQ belief scores increased from 86 to 98 (P&lt;0.001), and FSQ knowledge scores increased from 11 to 13 (P&lt;0.001).  Intervention resulted in some improved food safety self-reported practices for health majors but not non-health majors.  Intervention module post-test scores improved significantly for all students; health majors had greater increases.  &#xd;
     Conclusions.  Focused food safety discussion groups were useful for obtaining food safety information from college students; educational intervention improved college studentsâ food safety attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge and for health majors, some self-reported practices improved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) or epistaxis has been recognized in racehorses since the 16th century.  Since this time, great strides have been made in terms of identifying the lungs as the source of the hemorrhage via the endoscope, utilization of bronchoalveolar lavage to quantify the hemorrhage, and the discovery of successful treatments such as furosemide and the nasal strip that ameliorate, but do not abolish EIPH.  It has been determined that, in addition to extremely high pulmonary arterial pressures and the negative intrapleural pressures being the major physiologic forces causing pulmonary capillary stress failure, other factors have the potential for influencing the severity of EIPH including locomotory impact trauma, inflammatory airway disease (IAD), upper airway obstruction, coagulation anomalies, and high blood viscosity.  It has been hypothesized that EIPH is detrimental to performance and this was recently confirmed by Hinchcliff et al. in 2004.&#xd;
EIPH is a complex multi-factorial condition with much still unknown about the etiology, best method for diagnosis, and most effective form of treatment.  Chapter one of this dissertation determined the effectiveness of a novel treatment, concentrated equine serum, in ameliorating EIPH via reduction of IAD.  Chapter two refuted the hypothesis that herbal formulations commonly used in the field with anecdotal success would decrease EIPH by correcting coagulation deficits during exercise, as scientific efficacy was not evident, at least at the dose and duration used in our investigation.  Chapter three addressed the dogma that EIPH only occurs during maximal intensity exercise, and in demonstrating significant EIPH during sub-maximal exercise, emphasized the role that the airways play in contributing to the initiation and severity of EIPH.  Chapter four examined the occurrence and severity of EIPH in the horse’s canine counterpart, the racing Greyhound.  The demonstrated presence of mild EIPH in the Greyhound, a physiologically similar yet different athlete in comparison to the horse sheds new light on the etiology of this condition in both species.  &#xd;
The results of these investigations have advanced the frontiers of our knowledge concerning EIPH.  Specifically, they have generated novel information on the mechanistic bases of EIPH and have provided evidence supporting additional treatment options for reducing the severity of EIPH in horses.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The fate and bioavailability of organic contaminants in plants is a major ecological and human health concern. Current wet chemistry techniques that employ strong chemical treatments and extractions with volatile solvents, such as GC-MS, HPLC, and radiolabeling, although helpful, degrade plant tissue resulting in the loss of spatial distribution and the production of artifacts. Synchrotron radiation infrared microspectroscopy (SR-IMS) permits direct analysis of plant cell wall architecture at the cellular level in situ, combining spatially localized information and chemical information from the IR absorbances to produce a chemical map that can be linked to a particular morphology or functional group. This study demonstrated the use of SR-IMS to probe biopolymers such as cellulose, lignin, and proteins in the root tissue of hydroponically grown sunflower and maize plants as well as to determine the fate and effect of several organic contaminants in those root tissues. Principal components analysis (PCA), a data compression technique, was employed to reveal the major spectral variances between untreated and organic contaminant treated root tissues. Treatment with 1H-benzotriazole (BT) caused alterations to the lignin component in the root tissue of plants. The BT was found in xylem and epidermal tissue of sunflower plants but not associated with any particular tissue in maize roots. 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT) altered the pectin and polysaccharide structure in both maize and sunflower. SR-IMS revealed the reduction of DNTs to their aromatic amine form in the vascular and epidermal tissues at low concentration. At high concentration, DNTs appeared to be associated with all the plant tissues in maize and sunflower. Exposure of sunflower and maize to 2,6-dichlorophenol (2,6-DCP) caused alterations to the polysaccharide and protein component of the root tissue. In some cases, phenolic compounds were observed in the epidermal tissue of maize and sunflower roots. The results of this research indicate that SR-IMS has the potential to become an important analytical tool for determining the fate and effect of organic contaminants in plants.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to examine how the industrial process of rapid prototyping might reshape practice and making in architecture. Rapid prototyping is defined as an accelerated, adaptive evolution of a system or its components in some form using computer-aided drafting and manufacturing.&#xd;
Historically, all architecture was the intelligence of a single maker—the master builder. Specialization has caused architecture to fragment with architects serving only as designers. This report explores the ability of computer-aided drafting and manufacturing technologies to streamline the design procedure, which potentially increases the architect’s input into the process of building. Effectually, the architect narrows the distance between the design and the built—returning the&#xd;
architect to the role of master builder.&#xd;
An actual design exercise will examine the connection of architectural practice to making. To apply this research a habitable space was constructed through the incorporation of rapid prototyping.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The rice cultivar Oryzica Llanos 5 (OL5) possesses a high level of resistance to the fungus Magnaporthe grisea. The number and chromosomal location of quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance against eight isolates of the blast fungus were tested in two different populations of recombinant inbred lines from the cross Fanny x OL5. Twenty one QTL were detected and associated with the resistance traits, disease leaf area and lesion type, on 9 rice chromosomes. Eight of these 21 resistance loci had significant resistance effects in both experiments, while the others had effects that were only statistically significant in one experiment. Most, but not all, of the QTL occurred in the same genomic regions as either genes with major race-specific effects or other resistance QTL that had been described in previous experiments. Most of the QTL appeared to be race-specific in their effects but it is possible some of the QTL with smaller effects were nonspecific. One of the blast isolates used was FL440, which causes limited disease on OL5 and was probably virulent on most or all of the major genes from OL5. Three QTL affected resistance to FL440 in both experiments, one of which mapped to a region on chromosome 9 where no blast resistance genes have yet been mapped. An advanced backcross strategy with marker-assisted selection for OL5 alleles in QTL regions was used to generate five BC2F3 populations carrying five different target regions associated with partial resistance to rice blast disease. Three of five of these populations were analyzed for segregation for resistance to the M. grisea isolate FL440. One QTL designated qrbr-11.3 near the bottom of rice chromosome 11 was found to be significantly associated with partial blast resistance in 120 lines of a BC2F3 population (P&lt; 0.01). This QTL accounted for 12.4% and 8.0% of the phenotypic variation in diseased leaf area and lesion type observed under greenhouse inoculation. Examination of the genomic sequence at the qrbr-11.3 locus showed that twenty-nine&#xd;
candidate resistance genes are present at that locus (~1.8 Mb), twenty-seven of which are predicted NBS-LRR genes. Ultimately, the information from this study can be integrated into the development of improved lines with OL5-derived QTL for resistance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chitin, a linear homopolymer of beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, is the second most abundant biopolymer next to cellulose.  It is the major structural polysaccharide in the insect’s exoskeleton and gut lining.  An extensive study of two of the major genes encoding enzymes involved in chitin metabolism, chitin synthases (CHSs) and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (NAGs), was undertaken.  CHS genes from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and NAG genes from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, were identified and characterized.&#xd;
	In general, chitin deposition occurs in two major extracellular structures of insects, the cuticle that overlays the epidermis, and the peritrophic membrane (PM) that lines the midgut. Only two CHS genes were identified in M. sexta using Southern blot analysis.  Extensive expression studies of both M. sexta CHS genes, MsCHS1 and MsCHS2, suggest a strict functional specialization of these two genes for the synthesis of epidermal and PM-associated chitin, respectively.  Furthermore, two alternatively spliced transcripts of MsCHS1, MsCHS1a and MsCHS1b, were identified.  Analysis of the levels of these transcripts in different tissues and stages of development indicated that the MsCHS1a transcript predominates in the integument during the feeding and pupal stages, whereas the MsCHS1b transcript is more abundantly present in the tracheae, foregut, and hindgut during all developmental stages tested.&#xd;
	Four genes encoding putative NAGs (TcNAG1, TcNAG2, TcNAG3, and TcNAG4) were identified by searching the Tribolium genomic database.  The full-length cDNAs for all four NAGs were cloned and sequenced, and the exon-intron organizations were determined.  Studies on developmental expression patterns of each gene indicated that they are expressed during most developmental stages with TcNAG1 being the predominant one.  The function of each NAG was assessed by down regulating the level of each transcript at various developmental stages using RNA interference.  Selective knock down of each transcript, without significant reduction in the expression levels of the other NAG transcripts, was verified and the resulting phenotypes were documented.  Knockdown of TcNAG1 interrupted larval-larval, larval-pupal, and pupal-adult molting, and the insects were unable to completely shed their old cuticles.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study focuses on the waterfront redevelopment process associated with small town redevelopment projects.  The goal of this study will be to identify common and/or unique factors limiting and/or creating opportunities in the creation of small scale waterfronts.&#xd;
Many waterfronts of today have evolved from the unfriendly working waterfronts of the past, to a post-industrial environment sensitive to users needs.  With the inception of these user friendly waterfronts, many communities have experienced positive results influencing economics, community image, increased socialization in addition to many other positive attributes.  Unfortunately, smaller communities looking to take advantage of these desirable features often lack the resources needed to incorporate a waterfront redevelopment.  Many professionals involved in these unique projects are often challenged by the constraints associated with small scale riverfronts.  The goal of this research topic will be to gain a better understanding, from a professional perspective, what issues challenge the redevelopment process and why these challenges often curtail small scale waterfront projects.&#xd;
In an effort to better understand waterfront redevelopment, research involved background studies highlighting historical aspects, design, and implementation.  In addition to background studies, case studies of the successful Owensboro and Atchison Riverfront projects were developed enabling the identification of key factors essential to small scale redevelopment.  Furthermore, an annotated outline was developed as a guide for future communities to utilize as a foundation necessary in the successful implementation of a small scale waterfront redevelopment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Low Impact Development (LID) is an emerging ecological method for planning and designing&#xd;
stormwater management. The main goal of LID is that post development hydrology mimic&#xd;
predevelopment hydrology or that of the natural land pattern. The difference between LID and&#xd;
conventional end of pipe engineering is that LID is designed for on-site infiltration. LID was developed in&#xd;
Maryland and has since been adapted to other ecoregions. The introduction and background offer a review of the importance of ecological stormwater management and the basic principles and techniques of LID. Ecological stormwater management involves understanding and applying ecoregion factors such as: climate, physiography/ landform, geology, soils, and plant associations.&#xd;
This thesis begins with a brief overview of the ecoregional factors associated with the Topeka,&#xd;
Kansas (KS) area. Two case studies of LID type stormwater structures are investigated. The case studies, Jackson Street and Hillcrest, are projects of the City of Topeka Water Pollution Control Division (Topeka, KS). The primary topics investigated include: background, political approval process, condition of site&#xd;
before implementation, general project design, stormwater design, soil, plants, LID principles and techniques used, lessons learned, and a critique of each project. Investigation methods include: personal communication with key individuals involved, and a review of site visits, drawings, specifications, and other&#xd;
projects documents.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a synthetic biopolymer, is a promising substitute of some petroleum-based polymers due to its mechanical and biodegradable properties. But, because of the high cost of PLA (compared to those petroleum plastics for disposable application), starch has been incorporated into PLA to reduce cost and accelerate the biodegradability rate of the composites. But, the addition of starch as filler to PLA decreased mechanical performance of the composite. The addition of methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) into PLA/starch blends improved drastically the mechanical properties of the composite.&#xd;
Results from thermal-degradation analysis showed that PLA had the highest Arrhenius activation energy and strongest thermal endurance of all samples, followed by PLA/starch/MDI and PLA/starch. Aged samples exposed to fluctuating humidity storage conditions significantly decreased their performance. But, storing the samples in plastic bags could minimize degradation of properties. PLA and its composites with starch would not significantly affect application function when they are stored in controlled environment. PLA and PLA/starch based composites sealed in plastic bags can be stored in fluctuating humidity conditions (30-90% RH) for up to 30 days.&#xd;
Tensile strength, elongation, and damping increased with average particle size of starch granules (APS). But, declination of these properties was detected with APS larger than 45 mm. Crystallinity increased as the APS decreased. Young’s modulus, storage modulus, and moisture absorption were not significantly affected by the starch APS. The use of MDI as a coupling agent altered the role of starch APS on those properties of poly(lactic acid)/starch composite.&#xd;
The oxidation of the primary alcohol group on C6 of starch molecules up to 10% degree of substitution did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of PLA/starch/MDI, but the composites showed a reduced inelastic deformation (tensile curve) and significant increase in storage modulus and damping. Results suggest that a substitution of hydroxyl group on C6 of starch molecules for carboxyl group (up to 10%) increased the strengthening effect of MDI enough to reduce inelastic deformation of the composites upon load, but not enough to enhance mechanical properties.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We study geometric variational problems for a class of models in quantum field theory known as Faddeev-Skyrme models. Mathematically one considers minimizing an energy functional on homotopy classes of maps from closed 3-manifolds into homogeneous spaces of compact Lie groups. The energy minimizers known as Hopfions describe stable configurations of subatomic particles such as protons and their strong interactions. The Hopfions exhibit distinct localized knot-like structure and received a lot of attention lately in both mathematical and physical literature.&#xd;
&#xd;
High non-linearity of the energy functional presents both analytical and algebraic difficulties for studying it. In particular we introduce novel Sobolev spaces suitable for our variational problem and develop the notion of homotopy type for maps in such spaces that generalizes homotopy for smooth and continuous maps. As the spaces in question are neither linear nor even convex we take advantage of the algebraic structure on homogeneous spaces to represent maps by gauge potentials that form a linear space and reformulate the problem in terms of these potentials. However this representation of maps introduces some gauge ambiguity into the picture and we work out 'gauge calculus' for the principal bundles involved to apply the gauge-fixing techniques that eliminate the ambiguity. These bundles arise as pullbacks of the structure bundles H[arrow pointing right with hook on tail]G[arrow pointing right]G/H of homogeneous spaces and we study their topology and geometry that are of independent interest.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our main results include proving existence of Hopfions as finite energy Sobolev maps in each (generalized) homotopy class when the target space is a symmetric space. For more general spaces we obtain a weaker result on existence of minimizers only in each 2-homotopy class.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coleopteran insects compensate for dietary protease inhibitors by a number of mechanisms.  To study this compensation response at the molecular level, the digestive proteases of Tenebrio molitor were studied. Biochemical studies of the pH optima and inhibitor sensitivity of proteases indicated the cysteine proteases were mostly in the anterior and serine proteases were in the posterior midgut of T. molitor larvae. Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from T. molitor larval midgut cDNA libraries contained sequences encoding putative digestive proteases. Of a total of 1,528 cDNA sequences, 92 cDNAs encoded proteases, and 50 full-length cDNAs were grouped into serine, cysteine and metallo protease classes. Sequences tmt1a, tmt1b and tmt1c were identified as genes encoding isoforms of T. molitor trypsin, and tmc1a encoded T. molitor chymotrypsin. The general distribution cysteine protease transcripts in the anterior and serine protease transcripts in the posterior midgut, of T. molitor larvae, was in agreement with the biochemically-characterized compartmentalization of proteases. Expression analyses of selected transcripts demonstrated varied expression patterns across five developmental stages of T. molitor, with maximal expression of most protease transcripts in first instar larvae. Dietary serine and cysteine protease inhibitors fed in combination to early-instar T. molitor larvae caused a significant delay in larval growth in 21-day-old larvae. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of RNA isolated from larvae fed different protease inhibitor treatments indicated that dietary inhibitors affected the expression of serine and cysteine proteases. Larvae fed soybean trypsin inhibitor, a serine protease inhibitor, compensated by the hyperproduction of proteases from the same class, as well as the upregulation of cysteine proteases. A cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64, caused a reduction in the hyperproduction of all proteases, and, in combination with the soybean trypsin inhibitor, lowered the compensation response of T. molitor larvae to negligible levels. These data suggest that T. molitor larvae are more sensitive to the effects of cysteine protease inhibitors, perhaps because these proteases are the first line of defense for larvae against plant protease inhibitor. The bioassay and molecular studies suggested that combinations of inhibitors that target both serine and cysteine proteases are needed to effectively control larval infestations of T. molitor.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Laccases belong to the “multicopper oxidase” family of proteins, and can oxidize o-diphenols and p-diphenols in the presence of molecular oxygen. Laccases have been well characterized in wood-rotting fungi where they appear to play a role in lignin degradation, morphogenesis, and stress defense. More recently, laccase-2 has been found to play a role in the insect cuticle sclerotization and tanning. In addition, it has been hypothesized that laccase-1 may be involved in the oxidation of toxic phenolic compounds ingested by insects during feeding. A laccase-type phenoloxidase has been identified in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) using a combination of substrates that react with laccase. Within the pea aphid, laccase-1 transcript was found to be localized within the gut and the salivary glands. Finally, the specific regions where laccase-1 was present in the salivary gland was visualized using immunohistochemistry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Large specific surface areas and high concentrations of reactive edge and defect sites make NanoActive™ metal oxide powders ideal chemical adsorbents.  These powders are dispersed in aerosol form to remediate toxic wastes and neutralize chemical and biological warfare agents.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the destructive adsorption of toxic chemicals, effective application requires particles be as small as possible, thus, maximizing surface area and number of edge and defect sites.  Other applications, e.g. smoke clearing, require particles be large so they will settle in a timely manner.  Ideally, particle size control could be engineered into powder dispersion devices.  The purpose of this study was to explore particle cohesion and aerodynamic deaggregation mechanisms to enhance the design of powder dispersion devices.&#xd;
&#xd;
An aerosol generator and four experimental nozzles were designed to explore the most commonly referenced deaggregation mechanisms: particle acceleration, particles in shear and turbulent flows, and particle impaction.  The powders were then dispersed through the nozzles with increasing flow rates.  A small angle light scattering device was used to make in situ particle size measurements.  The nozzle designed for impaction deaggregated the NanoActive™ MgO particles to a lesser degree than the other three nozzles, which deaggregated the particles to a similar degree.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Flows in three of the four nozzles were simulated in a commercial computational fluid dynamics package.  Theoretical particle and aggregate stresses from the literature were  &#xd;
calculated using simulated data.  These calculations suggest particle acceleration causes internal stresses roughly three orders of magnitude larger than shear and turbulent flows.  These calculations, coupled with experimental data, lead to the conclusion that acceleration was the most significant cause of particle deaggregation in these experiments.&#xd;
&#xd;
Experimental data also identified the dependence of deaggregation on primary particle size and agglomerate structure.  NanoActive™ powders with smaller primary particles exhibited higher resistance to deaggregation.  Small primary particle size was thought to increase the magnitude of van der Waals interactions.  These interactions were modeled and compared to theoretical deaggregation stresses previously mentioned.&#xd;
&#xd;
In conclusion, deaggregation is possible.  However, the ideas of particle size control and a universal dispersion device seem elusive considering the material dependent nature of deaggregation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this work, we find the module structure of the cohomology of the group of four by four upper triangular matrices (with ones on the diagonal) with entries from the field on three elements modulo its center. Some of the relations amongst the generators for the cohomology ring are also given. This cohomology is found by considering a certain split extension. We show that the associated Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence collapses at the second page by illustrating a set of generators for the cohomology ring from generating elements of the second page. We also consider two other extensions using more traditional techniques.&#xd;
In the first we introduce some new results giving degree four and five differentials in spectral sequences associated to extensions of a general class of groups and apply these to both the extensions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We used a series of whole stream experiments to quantify the impacts of inorganic-nitrogen concentration on stream nitrogen cycling and transport in prairie streams.  We conducted 15NO3- stable isotope tracer experiments to measure the nitrogen cycling dynamics in 9 streams with a wide range (over 5 orders of magnitude) of nitrate concentrations.  The major nitrogen-transforming processes, including uptake, nitrification, and denitrification, increased approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and did not show signs of Michaelis-Menten type saturation across streams.  Denitrification only accounted for a small proportion of total nitrate uptake.  The observed functional relationships of biological nitrogen transformations and chronic nitrate concentration were best described by a Log-Log relationship.  A series of inorganic-nitrogen addition experiments were conducted to quantify the impacts of acute nitrogen inputs on nitrogen cycling.  These experiments showed that uptake saturated in response to short-term pulses of nitrogen.  Ambient concentrations of ammonium and nitrate were less than their respective half-saturation coefficients, and uptake rates were less than 5% of Vmax, suggesting severe limitation of nitrogen.  The saturation of uptake due to acute nitrogen inputs contrasts with uptake associated with chronic inputs of nitrate, which was not found to saturate. Chamber experiments and whole-stream ammonium addition experiments demonstrated that uptake and mineralization of ammonium varies spatially within the stream channel, occurring predominantly in riffles as opposed to pool habitats. The total transport distance of nitrogen and carbon within prairie streams was estimated based on field measurements and nutrient spiraling theory. Transport of organic nitrogen was dominant in prairie streams, as compared to inorganic nitrogen transport, both in terms of total concentration and transport distance. These results indicate that although carbon and inorganic-nitrogen were highly conserved in these headwater streams, organic-nitrogen was much more readily transported.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Until recently, minimal research has been done regarding the impact of veterinary student stress on the student’s significant intimate relationships. In this study of 466 veterinary students enrolled in five different accredited U.S. Colleges of Veterinary Medicine, the association of five primary variables, perceived stress, self-esteem, academic satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and general life satisfaction was investigated, utilizing McCubbin and Patterson’s (1983) Double ABCX Model as a guide. Six of the seven hypotheses were supported and further regression analysis yielded a model of variable associations that supported the Double ABCX Model, though significant gender differences were found. Specifically, female students perceived significantly more stress than did male students. With the exception of academic satisfaction and relationship satisfaction, all of the major variables were strongly correlated with each other. For the women, who comprised a significant majority of the sample, perceived stress had a significant impact on relationship satisfaction, as well as on self-esteem, which in turn significantly impacted academic satisfaction. Relationship satisfaction and academic satisfaction both significantly, and separately, impacted general life satisfaction, suggesting that relationship satisfaction and academic satisfaction are different constructs that operate independently of each other. However, both have a significant impact upon and are significantly associated with general life satisfaction, suggesting that neither can be neglected during veterinary training if a positive outcome is desired. For the men in this sample, stress impacted directly upon academic satisfaction, self-esteem, and general life satisfaction but did not have a direct impact upon relationship satisfaction. Instead, relationship satisfaction and general life satisfaction had a highly correlated relationship, with both significantly and strongly associated with the other. Although academic satisfaction and relationship satisfaction appear to be two separate entities, they are both important elements to achieving general life satisfaction during veterinary training and, therefore, should be equally attended to during the training process. These findings are interpreted and discussed in light of the implications for and importance of continued collaboration between veterinary students and programs and the field of Marriage and Family Therapy in an effort to understand and support students and their significant relationships during the veterinary training process.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Organic has become a familiar term in agriculture, usually bringing to mind the phrases “no chemicals” and “large premiums.”  While organic products usually command a substantial price premium over their conventional counterparts, the determinants of this premium are generally unknown.  The lack of literature covering organic prices is not from a lack of interest but from a lack of information and data for organic commodities.  This study examines two aspects of organic grain prices in an attempt to learn more about the organic grain sector.  &#xd;
The first objective was to identify determinants of organic premiums received by members of a Kansas organic grain cooperative.  Six different grains along with alfalfa hay were examined using hedonic models and bootstrapping statistical techniques.  Findings of the hedonic analyses are as follows.  Dairy farms seemed to pay a lower premium for feed grade corn and hard red winter wheat compared to other types of buyers.  Buyers located in Kansas tended to provide a smaller premium than buyers located elsewhere.  Early contract periods produced a smaller premium than later periods.  Shipment timing was much the same, with fourth quarter shipments receiving the largest premium.  Additionally, each subsequent contract year resulted in a larger premium.  If the cooperative had arranged shipment of the commodity, a lower premium was acquired.  Finally, longer contract lengths resulted in a larger premium.  &#xd;
The second part of this study examined various price series of organic and conventional commodities to determine if the two markets were related.  Using vector autoregressive models, cointegration and causality tests were conducted, and speed of adjustment to a shock in the long run equilibrium and exogeneity were also examined.   &#xd;
Of the 43 pairs of organic and conventional price series tested, 29 were found to be cointegrated.  Of those cointegrated pairs, 11 causal relationships were found.  Five of these  &#xd;
causal relationships indicated that the conventional commodity prices led the organic.  There were six instances where the organic commodity prices were found to lead the conventional.  For most causal relationships, about 5% of the adjustment to a shock, or divergence from long run equilibrium occurred in one week.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the creation of Facebook in 2004, colleges and universities across the United States have been playing catch-up with students. This new technology carries much weight as a new medium for students to build social connections and grow as members of their institutions. However, this new technology also brings negative implications such as lowered GPAs with greater use.&#xd;
Research was conducted at four major institutions across the country exploring how residence hall students use online communities and the impact it has on their physical world experience on campus. Most students use Facebook as a tool for staying connected to friends from high school, but there is a small population of students who are using it as a tool to make social connections they could not find in person.&#xd;
This study explores the impacts Facebook has had on a college campus. University administrators are urged to use this data to take a proactive approach to using these technologies to enhance the overall campus experience.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A new approach to synthesize nanosized strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) has been developed. Nanocrystals of mixed metal oxide were synthesized by a modified aerogel procedure from alkoxides.&#xd;
The textural and surface characteristic properties were studied by nitrogen BET analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and powder XRD. The crystallite sizes of aerogel prepared powders can vary from 6 to 25 nm by the use of different solvents. A mixture of ethanol and toluene was found to be the best binary solvent for supercritical drying, which produced a SrTiO3 sample with a surface area of 159 m2/g and an average crystallite size of 8 nm, and a BaTiO3 sample with a surface area of 175 m2/g and an average crystallite size of 6 nm. &#xd;
These titanates have been studied for photocatalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) in particular. The big band gaps of the bulk (3.2 eV for SrTiO3 and 3.1 eV for BaTiO3) limit their application to a UV light region only. The modification of titanates by doping with transition metal ions (partial substitution of Ti ions with metal ions) creates a valence band or electron donor level inside of the band gap, narrows it, and increases the visible light absorption. &#xd;
The enhanced adsorption of visible light was achieved by the synthesis of nanosized SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 by incorporating Cr ions during the modified aerogel procedure. Gaseous acetaldehyde photooxidation has been studied on pure SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, and on chromium doped Cr-SrTiO3 and Cr-BaTiO3 under UV and visible light irradiation, and compared with the photoactivity of P25 TiO2.&#xd;
SrTiO3 doped with antimony/chromium shows absorption in visible light and show photocatalytic activity for CH3CHO oxidation. The reason for the codoping of SrTiO3 with Sb/Cr was to maintain the charge balance and to suppress oxygen defects in the lattice. This photocatalyst shows high photoactivity under visible light irradiation even after several continuous runs. The photoactivity under visible and UV light irradiation was almost identical for the Sb/Cr-SrTiO3 photocatalyst.&#xd;
Dielectric properties of aerogel prepared barium titanate samples have being studied and the bulk resistance values of AP-BaTiO3 were significantly lower than that of commercial BaTiO3, by several orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Increasing human population, economic development and climatic changes in Sub-Saharan Africa have caused water scarcity, hence an urgent need for institutional arrangements that will lead to sustainable water management.  This study analyzes the impact of customary institutions on rural water management in Tanzania, and shows how they might be used to complement the statutory institutions. The study was conducted in Bariadi district, northwestern Tanzania. The data were collected from household surveys, focus group discussions, key informants, participant observations, photographs, and secondary data sources. The results indicate that customary institutions are the most commonly used in regulating equitable access to water, prevention of water pollution and abuse, and natural resource conflict resolution. The awareness of the customary laws was higher than statutory laws because of the participatory nature of the customary institutions.  Statutory institutions were found to be important for regulating water development issues. Villagers were not aware of statutory laws related to equitable water access, and prevention of water pollution and abuse. The study also found that customary institutions tend to discriminate against women. Women do not have land rights and were not allowed to participate in customary institutions activities. These results suggest the need for the government to recognize the importance of customary institutions in water management. The government needs to design policies and strategies that will ensure that women’s rights are respected by the customary institutions. There is also a need for fostering women’s participation in decision making, and designing cooperative institutions that are organized and governed by resource users themselves.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation is an extensive study of several issues related to post deposition morphological evolution of fcc metal surfaces. These studies were carried out by probing the energetics and the dynamics of underlying atomistic mechanisms responsible for surface diffusion. An important aspect is the determination of relative probability of competing atomistic mechanisms and their contribution to controlling shapes and step edge patterns of nano structures on surfaces. In this scenario, the descent of adatoms from Ag islands on Ag(111) surface is examined. It shows an exchange mechanism to dominate over hopping and the process to favor the formation of (100)-microfacetted steps (A-type) over the (111)-microfacetted ones (B-type). Molecular dynamics simulations support these results at low temperature while at high temperature B-type step formation dominates. This change in the trend could happen if these processes leading to the formation of the A and B type steps have different values of their diffusion prefactors. This difference is confirmed on the basis of our calculations of the diffusion coefficients. Further, to understand the macroscopic properties of a system on the basis of its atomic scale information, spatial and temporal fluctuations of step edges on vicinal Cu(1 1 13) and Cu(1 1 19) surfaces is studied using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. These results show excellent agreement with experimental data, highlighting the role of mass transport along step edges, and also showing the validity of tools like KMC which aims at bridging the gap in length and time scales at which a range of interesting phenomena take place. To facilitate unbiased modeling of material properties, a novel way of performing KMC simulations is presented. In this approach the lists of diffusion processes are automatically collected during the simulation using a saddle-point search method in the potential energy landscape. The speed of the simulations is thus enhanced along with a substantial gain in reliability. Using this method the diffusion and coalescence of two-dimensional Cu and Ag adatom-island on Cu(111) and Ag(111) is studied. Together with input from molecular dynamics simulations, new processes involving the concerted motion of smaller islands are revealed. A significant difference in the scaling of the effective diffusion barriers with island size is observed for the sets of smaller (less than 10 atoms) and larger islands. In particular, the presence of concerted island motion leads to an almost linear increase in the effective diffusion barrier with size, while its absence accounts for strong size-dependent oscillations and anomalous behavior for trimers and heptamers. A crossover from diffusion due to the collective motion of the smaller island to a regime in which the island diffuses through the periphery dominated mass transport (large islands, 19 to 100 atoms) is predicted. For islands containing 19 to 100 atoms the scaling exponent is found to be in good agreement with that found in previous studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effect of fat level and antioxidant Origanox on the formation of 2-dodecylcylobutanone (2-DCB) was investigated in fresh irradiated ground beef patties.  Patties containing 15% and 25% fat were irradiated by electron beam at 1, 2, 3, and 4.5 kGy.  Ground beef patties with 0.08% Origanox were gamma irradiated at 3.0 kGy. Commercially available irradiated ground beef with different fat levels was analyzed in order to estimate dose absorbed by these samples.   &#xd;
	The 2-DCB was extracted by Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The concentration of 2-DCB increased linearly with dose with no significant difference in 2-DCB concentrations between the two fat levels.  The estimated doses applied to the commercial samples ranged between 1.38 kGy and 1.55 kGy.  Origanox did not affect the concentration of 2-DCB. &#xd;
	Mutagenicity of 2-DCB was evaluated by the Ames assay using five standard Salmonella tester strains with S9 enzyme activation.  The Ames assay did not show a mutagenic effect of 2-DCB, including samples incubated with S9.   Acute toxicity of 2-DCB was evaluated by the Microtox acute toxicity system and compared with cyclohexanone and 2-nonenal (both GRAS additives).  The toxicity of 2-DCB was between that of cyclohexanone and 2-nonenal while the maximum toxic effect elicited by 2-DCB was the least of the three compounds. &#xd;
	Metabolism of 2-DCB was investigated in Female Sprague-Dawley rats.  Hexane extracts of feces and fat were analyzed by GC-MS.  Urine with and without added β-glucuronidase, was monitored for glucuronide complexes by hexane extraction GC-MS.  The total amount of 2-DCB recovered in feces was 1.78 ± 0.63 mg over five days, about 3-11% of the total 2-DCB administered.  The total amount recovered in fat was 0.08 ± 0.01 mg which was approximately 0.33% of the total 2-DCB administered.  No metabolites were recovered in any of the urine extracts.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Research that investigates the dynamics of knowledge construction by students as they model phenomena at the microscopic level has not been extensively conducted in physics and science education in general.  This research wherein I investigated the dynamics of knowledge construction of students in the context of microscopic friction is an attempt to do so.&#xd;
The study commenced with an investigation of the variations in the existing models of students about microscopic friction (phase I of the study).  Clinical interviews were conducted with introductory physics students in order to elicit their models.  A phenomenographic approach of data analysis was employed to establish the variations in students’ models.  Results show that students’ mental models of friction at the atomic level are dominated by their macroscopic experiences.  Friction at the atomic level according to most students is due to mechanical interactions (interlocking or rubbing of atoms).&#xd;
Can we build on these macroscopic ideas of students in order to help them construct more scientific explanations of friction at the atomic level?  The second phase of the research was an investigation of the dynamics of knowledge construction of students as they constructed models of friction at the atomic level while building on their prior ideas.  Individual as well as group teaching interviews were conducted with introductory physics students in order to investigate students learning trajectories and the processes they undergo as they created new models of friction at the atomic level.  Results show that the span, zone of proximal development and the epistemological orientations of the students greatly influenced the extent to which they utilize scaffolding afforded to them during the model-building process.  Moreover, results show that students undergo the process of incorporation and displacement during their model construction and reconstruction.&#xd;
In the third phase, an instructional material geared towards helping students develop more scientific explanations of microscopic friction was developed and pilot-tested. &#xd;
 Overall, the results of the study have significant implications for further research, in improving instruction, and curriculum material development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Many introductory calculus-based physics students have difficulties when solving physics problems involving calculus.  This study investigates students’ retention and transfer from calculus to physics.  While retention is the ability to recall your knowledge at a later point in time, transfer of learning is defined as the ability to apply what one has learned in one situation to a different situation.&#xd;
In this dissertation we propose a theoretical framework to assess students’ transfer of learning in the context of problem solving.  We define two kinds of transfer – horizontal transfer and vertical transfer.  Horizontal transfer involves applying previously learned ideas in a problem.  Vertical transfer involves constructing new ideas to solve the problem.  Students need to employ both horizontal and vertical transfer when they solve any problem.  This framework evolves through this research and provides a lens that enables us to examine horizontal and vertical transfer.  Additionally, this proposed framework offers researchers a vocabulary to describe and assess transfer of learning in any problem solving context.&#xd;
We use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to examine transfer in the context of problem solving.  The participants in this study were students enrolled in a second-semester physics course taken by future engineers and physicists, calculus instructors and physics instructors.  A total of 416 students’ exam sheets were collected and reviewed.  Statistical methods were used to analyze the quantitative data.  A total of 28 students and nine instructors were interviewed.  The video and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed in light of the aforementioned theoretical framework.&#xd;
A major finding from this study is that a majority of students possess the requisite calculus skills, yet have several difficulties in applying them in the context of physics.  These difficulties included: deciding the appropriate variable and limits of integration; not being clear about the criteria to determine whether calculus is applicable in a given physics problem, and others.  This study also provides a detailed understanding of students’ difficulties in terms of our theoretical framework.  Instructional strategies are suggested at the end to facilitate the transfer from calculus to physics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, is a pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. Studies to find control methods were initiated in 2000 when it was first detected in the United States. Aphis glycines can reduce yields by as much as 50%, and vectors several viral diseases. Plant resistance to A. glycines is one important component of integrated control. In the first study, reproduction of A. glycines was compared on 240 soybean entries. Eleven had fewer nymphs produced compared with two susceptible checks (KS4202 and Pioneer® 95B15). Antibiosis and antixenosis were assessed in no-choice and choice tests, respectively. Nine entries showed moderate antibiosis and the other two (K1639 and Pioneer® 95B97) showed strong antibiosis and antixenosis as categories of resistance to A. glycines. In the second study, chlorophyll loss was estimated in no-choice tests on infested and uninfested leaves of KS4202. The minimum combined number to detect significant chlorophyll loss was 30 aphids confined for 10 days. Using this number, seven resistant entries found in the first study were evaluated. There was no significant chlorophyll reduction between infested and uninfested leaves of five of the resistant entries (K1621, K1639, 95B97, Dowling and Jackson). Jackson and Dowling had a significantly lower percentage loss than the susceptible checks. In the third study, assessment of feeding behavior of A. glycines was compared and recorded for 9 h on four resistant entries and KS4202. The average time needed to reach the first sieve element phase by A. glycines was 3.5 h in KS4202 while in the resistant entries it was 7.5 h, and the total duration in this phase was longer than an hour in KS4202, and only two to seven minutes in the resistant entries. These data suggest that phloem tissues in the resistant plants change feeding behavior. However, aphids first reached the xylem phase and then the sieve element phase, and the time that aphids spent ingesting xylem sap was not different among all entries; therefore, it is possible that xylem sap in the resistant entries may contain toxic substances that alter aphid behavior and restrain further activities on the sieve element phase.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Important bidirectional interactions exist between the central nervous system and the&#xd;
immune system. Neural-immune interactions provide a regulatory system in the body and&#xd;
disturbances in these interactions may lead to disease. Although the sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a key role in mediating neural-immune interactions, central neural mechanisms&#xd;
mediating sympathetic-immune interactions and the effect of centrally-induced alterations in sympathetic nerve discharge on immune function is not known. We tested the hypothesis that central activation of sympathetic neural circuits alters splenic cytokine gene expression. In a separate study, we tested the hypothesis that hypothermia-induced changes in visceral sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) would be attenuated in middle-aged and aged compared with young rats. Previous studies have demonstrated that skin sympathoexcitatory responses to skin cooling are attenuated in aged compared with young subjects, suggesting that advancing age influences sympathetic nerve responsiveness to cooling. The effect of age on sympathetic nerves innervating other targets organs during acute cooling remains unknown. Central activation of splenic SND was produced using three different experimental interventions: increased core body&#xd;
temperature produced by acute heating, intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II (ANGII), and decreased core body temperature produced by acute cooling. Changes in gene expression profiles were analyzed using inflammatory cytokine-specific gene-array and further validated using real-time RT-PCR analysis. The following observations were made. 1)Splenic SNDincreased in response to each experimental intervention except in acute cooled young rats where there was a decrease in splenic SND. 2) Splenic cytokine gene expression of pro-inflammatory&#xd;
cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2) and chemokines (GRO1, CXCL2, CCCL2 and, CXCL10) was increased in response to each experimental intervention. 3) Expression of splenic cytokine genes was reduced after splenic-denervation except in acute cooled rats. 4) Progressive hypothermia reduced splenic, renal, and adrenal SND in rats and was generally attenuated in middle-aged and aged rats. These results demonstrate the functional significance of changes in sympathetic nerve activity on splenic immune cell activation and the effect of age on SND responses to core body cooling.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The reproductive strategies of avian brood parasites and the behavioral responses of their hosts have served as a model of co-evolution in nature.  Host adaptations to reduce the costs of parasitism are countered with novel parasite behaviors that increase the success of the parasite and thereby decrease host productivity.  Not all host species possess anti-parasite defense behaviors, and parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) may cause population declines in some species.  Bell’s Vireo (Vireo bellii) is a small-bodied cowbird host that fails to fledge young if successfully parasitized.  Although vireos desert naturally parasitized nests, the cues that cause desertion have not been identified.  Understanding how parasitism affects vireo productivity is important because cowbird removal is an integral component of the recovery efforts for the endangered Least Bell’s Vireo (V. b. pusillus) in California.  However, it is generally unknown how cowbird removal affects vireo productivity.  To address these issues, I monitored the productivity of vireos nesting in Kansas at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, conducted a clutch manipulation experiment, and experimentally removed cowbirds.  In addition, I used stable isotope analysis to determine if recently fledged cowbird young could be assigned to habitats or host species.  I found that vireos did not desert nests due to the presence of a cowbird egg; rather egg removal by cowbirds caused desertion, which is a generalized response in many taxa of birds.  Cowbird removals decreased parasitism of vireo nests by approximately 36% and led to a 2-fold increase in vireo productivity per pair.  Cowbird productivity from vireo pairs increased because fewer parasitized nests were deserted and parasitized nests on removal plots had a higher probability of success.  No cowbird removal study has reported an increase in cowbird productivity in response to trapping.  Cowbird nestlings from prairie plots and shrub plots differed in carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions, and 87% of locally produced juvenile cowbirds were classified with nestlings from shrub plots.  Thus, the continued expansion of woody plants into tallgrass prairie may result in local increases in cowbird productivity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the current high-stakes assessment environment of NCLB and AYP, the type of assessment students are subject to is crucial.  Good assessments make teaching to the test an effective, rather than deplorable, strategy that aligns learning objectives, classroom teaching, and student achievement.  While science, this author’s content area, isn’t currently AYP mandated, it will be soon, and in the meantime, students are still required to take state and local assessments.  This project seeks to effect change on a local level – specifically, with how the local CRT is written so that it can both reflect sound research-based assessment practice as well as an understanding of science as concept- and process-based rather than content- and fact-based.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Landscape architects have the opportunity to compose a setting in which certain types of socialization may prosper by altering the environment to improve opportunities for socialization. Socialization, or interpersonal contact, is a primary determinant in the formation of individual characteristics and behavior. The experiences to which one is exposed contribute to personal development and are affected by environmental stimuli.&#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of this thesis is to document the design process of a project that has&#xd;
enhancement of socialization as the primary goal. This study includes a review of the existing literature to determine the design elements that can improve socialization in the designed environment employing the theories of Randolph Hester (1975), Clare Cooper Marcus with Trudy Wischemann (1998) and William “Holly” Whyte (1980). These design elements are categorized by the types of socialization that they can facilitate: manifest, latent, and spontaneous interaction. Next, a case study of Spaights Plaza on the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee campus was conducted to define the current socialization levels among university users. A new design addressing socialization elements was drafted, and a comparative analysis of the existing and proposed designs concludes the thesis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Law enforcement is widely regarded as one of the most stressful and violent professions. Officer stress is associated with a number of negative behaviors and psychological outcomes including high rates of substance abuse, divorce, and violence. Concerns over officer violence include both work-related acts, like use of excessive force or unwarranted deadly force, and non-work related violence such as domestic abuse. Despite interest in the interplay between subcultural attitudes, organizational structure, and high stress events, most research on police violence fails to address a fundamental concern--that of gender. In fact, the majority of research addressing officer stress fails to mention gender or concentrates on gender as a simple control variable. In order to examine how gender, stress, and law enforcement structures predict violent behavior among police officers, this dissertation utilizes both existing data and direct officer interviews. Findings show that law enforcement remains largely a masculine enterprise, and that gender drives images, interaction, and organizational behavior, often at the expense of both men and women officers. Stress, burnout, and use of violence by officers are not simply a response to high stress events, but are embedded in the gender structure and process of policing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Building upon macrostructural “social threat” (Blalock, 1967) research, the current study develops a theoretical model of judicial decision-making processes that focuses upon racial threats perceived within individual court contexts and the corresponding effects on individual sentencing outcomes. This model recognizes that in the absence of a true-measure of a defendant’s threat to the community (likelihood to re-offend) judicial decision makers often rely upon stereotypical generalizations regarding offender populations to render decisions. Although actors develop biases and stereotypes through interactions with society in general, the most relevant knowledge affecting sentencing decisions is perceptions gained through the course of work. Similar to the influential “Pygmalion in the Classroom” study, biases and stereotypes regarding the criminality of groups of criminal defendants are pervasive in contemporary society, undoubtedly influencing sentencing outcomes. Therefore, the most meaningful measurement of threat, as it pertains to sentencing, is the contextual composition of court caseloads. Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics-State Court Processing Statistics (SCPS) program, this study examines court-contextual or caseload level threats and the interaction between courtroom context and individual offense/offender characteristics and the corresponding impact on sentencing outcomes. Findings demonstrate that courts of high minority defendant volume apply more punitive sanctions to (increased sentence length and odds of incarceration) to all defendants within this context, while black defendants receive the greatest sanctions. These findings support assertions regarding the impact of threatening populations within courtroom contexts.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of modern wheat, has served as an important source of genetic variation in wheat breeding.  The objective of this research was to characterize and utilize multiple Ae. tauschii-derived pest resistance genes contained in the germplasm KS96WGRC40.&#xd;
&#xd;
Two Ae. tauschii-derived genes, H23 and Cmc4, provide resistance to the Hessian fly (HF) and wheat curl mite (WCM), respectively.  A linkage analysis of a testcross population estimated 32.67% recombination between H23 and Cmc4 on chromosome 6DS in wheat indicating that the two genes are not tightly linked as previous mapping reports show.  Haplotype data of recombinant lines and physical mapping of linked microsatellite markers located Cmc4 distal to H23.  Haplotype data indicated that both KS89WGRC04 and KS96WGRC40 have the distal portion of 6DS derived from Ae. tauschii.  Microsatellite primer pairs BARC183 and GDM036 were more useful than the previously published linked markers in identifying lines carrying Cmc4 and H23, respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
Through phenotypic selection and advancement within the testcross population, three TC1F2:4 lines were identified as homozygous resistant for H23 and Cmc4 and have the complete terminal segment of 6DS from Ae. tauschii.  Two lines are more desirable than the original germplasm releases and can serve as a source of resistance to both HF and WCM in an elite background.&#xd;
&#xd;
A linkage analysis of a segregating recombinant inbred line population identified an Ae. tauschii-derived gene of major effect conferring resistance to Septoria leaf blotch (STB) and another Ae. tauschii-derived gene of major effect conferring resistance to soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) in the germplasm KS96WGRC40.  The STB resistance gene in KS96WGRC40 is located in the distal 40% of the short arm of chromosome 7D flanked by microsatellite markers Xgwm044 and Xbarc126.  Two previously reported STB genes, Stb4 and Stb5, have been mapped to 7DS in the same region as the STB resistance gene in KS96WGRC40.  The uniqueness of the STB resistance genes on 7DS is questionable.  The SBWMV resistance gene in KS96WGRC40 is located on chromosome 5DL linked to microsatellite marker Xcfd010.  The SBWMV resistance gene within KS96WGRC40 was derived from TA2397 via KS95WGRC33.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research developed a model to assess beliefs and perceptions of employees about following a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) -based food safety program in Childcare Centers.  The four Health Belief Model constructs included perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers.  Because of their proven worth in behavioral research, the constructs behavioral intention and self-efficacy were added to the model.  An instrument designed to test the model was mailed to directors and foodservice employees at accredited Childcare Centers in six Midwestern states (n = 528).  The final response rate was 17.5 percent.  &#xd;
Self-efficacy was tested as a moderator between the independent variables and behavioral intentions.  Exploratory factor analysis identified factors.  Most items loaded as expected, but the construct perceived severity loaded on two factors requiring an additional factor in the model.  The final factor names included perceived susceptibility, center consequences, child consequences, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions.  The model accounted for 70.07% of the variance for a six-factor model.&#xd;
Perceived benefits and self-efficacy significantly affected behavioral intentions to follow a HACCP-based food safety program.  In addition, self-efficacy had a moderating effect on the relationship between perceived benefits and behavioral intentions.  Results indicated that directors and foodservice employees understood that children are susceptible to foodborne illnesses.  However, they did not believe that a foodborne illness could occur at their Center, and if it did, there would be no consequences to themselves or the Center.  &#xd;
Improved construct items need to be developed and tested utilizing a population that has more knowledge about HACCP-based food safety programs.  This model should be tested with other populations that are familiar with HACCP-based food safety programs to determine if perceived susceptibility, severity, or barriers have an impact on behavioral intentions to follow a HACCP-based food safety program.  Once beliefs and perceptions about food safety practices and behaviors are identified, interventions can be tailored to address specific misconceptions resulting in improved food safety practices and behaviors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cattle-grazing is a dominant land use in the United States, with more than 300 million hectares of land grazed each year.  The habitat changes facilitated by cattle grazing can influence resource availability and habitat selection for associated wildlife.  To investigate the potential for changes in traditional livestock management to restore native grassland and riparian habitat, we evaluated biological community responses to winter-grazing and livestock exclusion at the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant in southeastern Kansas.  In grassland habitats, we combined winter-grazing by domestic cattle and discontinued fertilization in an attempt to restore pastures dominated by tall fescue to native tallgrass prairie and improve habitat for grassland-breeding birds.  We observed a decrease in tall fescue and an increase in native, warm-season grasses in winter-grazed pastures compared to fertilized, year-round grazed pastures.  Grassland-breeding bird responses to winter-grazing were species-specific.  Dickcissels preferred winter-grazed pastures, while Eastern Meadowlarks and Grasshopper Sparrows tended to prefer year-round grazed pastures.  Dickcissels were negatively correlated with the presence of cattle during the breeding season and the abundance of tall fescue.  Grasshopper Sparrows were negatively correlated with native, warm-season grass abundance and visual obstruction, but were positively correlated with forb abundance.  Henslow’s Sparrows and Common Yellowthroats were detected breeding in low numbers on pastures that had been winter-grazed for five years.  Our results suggest that winter-grazing and discontinued fertilization of agricultural grasslands can direct semi-natural plant communities toward tallgrass prairie and benefit some grassland-breeding birds. &#xd;
In riparian habitats, livestock were excluded from 1996 to 2005.  We measured bird community responses in grazed and ungrazed sites using baseline data collected in 1996-97 and post-treatment data collected in 2004-05.  Riparian bird community data were analyzed using robust design mark-recapture models that allowed us to evaluate changes in bird species richness while accounting for differences in detectability among species.  We detected increases in species richness in both ungrazed and grazed treatments.  We observed few differences in community vital rates between treatments; however, we did detect differences in guild responses.  The changes observed within both grazed and ungrazed riparian bird communities were likely influenced by regional fluctuations in species richness and composition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sericea lespedeza [Lespedeza cuneata (Dumont) G. Don] is a rangeland weed of the tallgrass prairie of Kansas. Experiments were carried out during the 2001-2003 growing seasons (June-November) to examine the relationship between sericea lespedeza&#xd;
and other rangeland species, wildlife use and dispersal of sericea lespedeza propagules, and the relationship between sericea lespedeza stubble height and utilization by livestock.&#xd;
Sericea lespedeza cover was positively correlated with violet lespedeza (r=0.25)&#xd;
[Lespedeza violacea (L.) Pers.], heath aster (Aster ericoides L.) (r=0.23) and total forb&#xd;
cover (r=0.56). Sericea lespedeza composition was negatively correlated with big&#xd;
bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman.) (r=-0.27) and sideoats grama [Bouteloua&#xd;
curtipendula (Michx. Torr.)] (r=-0.27) composition and positively correlated with&#xd;
western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya D.C.) (r=0.21) and violet lespedeza (r=0.36)&#xd;
composition. Sericea lespedeza density was inversely related to forb species richness on&#xd;
all sites. On half the sites, there was also an inverse relationship between grass species&#xd;
richness and sericea lespedeza density. Grazed sites had less difference in grass species&#xd;
richness between high and low levels of sericea lespedeza densities. There was no evidence of an ecological threshold to the detriment of species richness with increasing sericea lespedeza density.&#xd;
Cattle digestive processes did not affect sericea lespedeza germination. Quail digestive processes enhanced germination of the few seeds that were excreted. Quail diet selection was investigated with a field study. Five out of 49 crops collected contained seed classified as sericea lespedeza. None of these seeds germinated in the greenhouse. Both cattle and quail could potentially disperse sericea lespedeza seed, but voluntary consumption appears to be low for both species, at least during November when other&#xd;
food is available. &#xd;
An height-weight table estimating percent utilization for various grazed and ungrazed heights of sericea lespedeza was constructed. Coefficient of determination values were greater than 0.85 between plant height and weight, indicating that the heightweight method was appropriate for estimating sericea lespedeza utilization. Using additional regression analysis, a chart for estimating forage from percent of plants grazed was constructed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Phytoseiulus persimilis (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a specialist predator on tetranychid mites, especially on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). The foraging environment of the predatory mites consists of prey colonies distributed in patches within and among plants. Quantitative genetic studies have shown genetic variation in, and phenotypic correlations among, several foraging behaviors within populations of the predatory mite, P. persimilis.  The correlations between patch location, patch residence, consumption and oviposition imply possible fitness trade-offs. We used molecular techniques to investigate genetic variation underlying the foraging behaviors. However, these genetic studies require a sufficiently large amount of DNA which was a limiting factor in our studies. Therefore, we developed a method for obtaining DNA from a single mite by using a chelex extraction followed by whole genome amplification. Whole genome amplification from a single mite provided us with a large quantity of high-quality DNA. We obtained more than a ten thousand-fold amplified DNA from a single mite using 0.01ng as template DNA. Sequence polymorphisms of P. persimilis were analyzed for nuclear DNA Inter Transcribed Spacers (ITS1 &amp; ITS2) and for a mitochondrial 12S rRNA. The sequence comparisons among individuals identified a number of polymorphisms in the 12S sequences. &#xd;
 The foraging gene (for) associated with rover-sitter behavioral strategies of Drosophila is known to have role in feeding behaviors of honeybee and other arthropods. We surmised that the same or a similar gene may be present in P. persimilis.  Among the foraging behavior(s) exhibited by this predatory mite, we were particularly interested in resource/prey-dependent dispersal behavior. We isolated a partial sequence that is presumed to be the orthologue of the foraging (for) gene. We named the putative foraging gene as Ppfor (for Phytoseiulus persimilis foraging gene). We used a fragment of Ppfor gene as a molecular marker between populations and among individuals and, further, to help understand behavioral phenotypes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sensory qualities of a place are those that help people perceive a place through their senses (Lynch 1976). Responsiveness of a place is its ability to provide the user with a wide range of choices and opportunities (Bentley et al 1985). This thesis demonstrates a study of sensory and responsive qualities of urban spaces through the description of two civic nodes in the city of Calcutta, India – the Dalhousie Square and the Salt Lake City Center.&#xd;
&#xd;
The demonstration technique adopted for the study uses Geographic Information System. This system, with the help of specialized computer software can manipulate, summarize, query, edit and visualize geographic information stored in a database. In this study site observations on the two civic nodes are presented as layers of information in Geographic Information System. &#xd;
&#xd;
The civic nodes selected for this study were built at different times. The Dalhousie Square is the historic city center of the city of Calcutta, built during the British rule (1776-1947) over India. The Salt Lake City Center is a mixed-use retail development designed by the Indian architect Charles Correa.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Grinding is one of the important operations employed in modern manufacturing industry to remove materials and achieve desired geometry and surface finish. Simultaneous double side grinding (SDSG) and ultrasonic vibration assisted grinding (UVAG) are two typical cost-effective grinding processes which are utilized to grind semiconductor materials and high performance ceramic materials, respectively.&#xd;
The objectives of this research are to investigate several technical issues in modern grinding processes by using theoretical, numerical, and experimental research approaches. Those technical issues are related to SDSG and UVAG, which have been chosen as two typical grinding processes for this research.&#xd;
This thesis reviews the literature on SDSG (covering process applications, modeling of grinding marks, and modeling of wafer shapes) and UVAG (covering process applications, edge chipping, and coolant effects, etc). The theoretical research work of this thesis is conducted by developing mathematical models for grinding marks and wafers shapes in SDSG of silicon wafers. These developed models are then used to study the effects of SDSG parameters on the curvature of the grinding marks, the distance between adjacent grinding marks, and the wafer shapes.&#xd;
The numerical research work of this thesis is done by conducting a three dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA) of UVAG process. A 3-D FEA model is developed to study the edge chipping commonly observed in UVAG of ceramics. Edge chippings not only compromises geometric accuracy but also possibly causes an increase in machining cost. A solution to reduce the edge chipping is proposed based upon the FEA simulations and validated by pilot experiments.&#xd;
Several experimental studies are conducted to provide new knowledge for the UVAG process. Firstly, a novel coolant delivery system is explored for UVAG machine system. Secondly, UVAG is introduced into machining of fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Results of a feasibility study and a designed experimental investigation show that UVAG is a promising process for CMC machining. Finally, an experimental study on cutting forces during UVAG of zirconia/alumina composites is conducted. The feasibility to machine different zirconia/alumina composites using UVAG is also investigated and discussed.&#xd;
The findings in this thesis will provide theoretical and practical guidance for modern grinding processes especially for SDSG and UVAG.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Concerns regarding management of animal disease and related perceptions about food safety have escalated substantially in recent years. Terrorist attacks of September 2001, discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a dairy cow in December 2003 in Washington state and subsequent discoveries of BSE infected animals in Texas in 2005 and Alabama in 2006, and recent worldwide outbreaks of highly contagious animal diseases (i.e., Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Avian Influenza A (H5N1)) have made apparent the need for animal traceability in U.S. livestock production and marketing. In addition, animal identification and trace-back systems are rapidly developing throughout the world increasing international trading standards.&#xd;
&#xd;
In recent years, increasing numbers of economic analyses of animal diseases have integrated epidemiological models into economic frameworks. However, there are only a few studies that have used this integrated framework to analyze the effects of animal traceability on highly contagious animal diseases.&#xd;
&#xd;
This study’s goal is to quantify and evaluate the economic impacts of different depths of animal identification/trace-back systems in the event of a hypothetical highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease outbreak that poses a threat to U.S. livestock competitiveness. Specifically, an epidemiological disease spread model is used to evaluate the impact of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in southwest Kansas. The information obtained from the disease spread model is then used in conjunction with an economic model to determine the changes in welfare of producers and consumers.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results obtained from the epidemiological model indicate that as the depth of animal identification in cattle is increased, the number of animals destroyed is reduced as are the associated costs. Also, the length of the outbreak is reduced by approximately two weeks. The economic results suggest that as surveillance is increased, decreases in producer and consumer welfare are smaller. Furthermore, as surveillance is increased, decreases in producer and consumer surplus measures can be reduced by approximately 60 percent.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the field of asymmetric catalysis salens and related molecules occupy a unique position in the breath and scope of reactions facilitated.  They, nonetheless, are characterized by several conformationally derived limitations.  This work deals with applying the principles of helicity with the goal of remedying these shortcomings, thereby ultimately fashioning, better, more selective catalysts.&#xd;
	A series of novel ligands bearing phenanthryl and benz[a]anthryl side-arms attached to either a cyclohexyl or binaphthyl backbone bridging group, were prepared via multi-step synthesis.  The ligands were subsequently metallated with zinc and iron salts to afford neutral helimeric complexes, that were characterized in the solution and solid states.  The binaphthyl complexes were found via X-ray crystallographic analysis to afford exclusively M-helimers, while those incorporating a cyclohexyl bridge gave predominantly 1 : 1 P + M mixtures.  A significantly greater degree of side-arm overlap was apparent where benz[a]anthryl side-arms were employed.  1H NMR analysis, unfortunately, did not allow for solution phase helimer determination, and ECD spectroscopy was therefore utilized as an alternative.  In conjunction with computational techniques the conformations were probed, and to a high degree of certainty the prevailing solution geometries of the cyclohexyl complexes predicted.  Our results indicate that in solution the M configuration is the sole or dominant form. &#xd;
Ionic zinc complexes based upon a tetradentate nitrogen donor motif and 8-isopropyl-2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde were also prepared. Structural characterization of the zinc complexes showed each to bind to two ZnCl2 units, and as a consequence to form dinuclear helicates.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The overall aim of this dissertation is to better understand the dynamic matching between O2 delivery and uptake following the onset of exercise.  The first study of this dissertation (Chapter 2) revealed that: i) the dynamics of muscle oxygenation were determined primarily by the QO2–VO2 interaction during the initial phase of QO2 response (first 15-20 s); and ii) absolute values in the steady state used to calculate blood flow from VO2 and O2 extraction did not affect the dynamics of blood flow response.  Consistent with these predictions, using pulmonary gas exchange and near-infrared spectroscopy in humans (Chapter 3) we observed that the estimated kinetics of capillary blood flow (moderate exercise 25.4 ± 9.1 s and heavy exercise 25.7 ± 7.7 s) were not significantly different from the kinetics of muscle VO2 (moderate exercise 25.5 ± 8.8 s and heavy exercise 25.6 ± 7.2 s).  In Chapter 4 we observed that nitric oxide (NO) is essential to maintain microvascular O2 pressure (PO2mv ~ QO2/VO2) of contracting rat muscles.  Blockade of NO synthase with L-NAME accelerated the kinetics [ΔMean response time(L-NAME–CONTROL) = -6.5 ± 6.6 s, P&lt; 0.05] and reduced the contracting steady-state PO2mv [ΔPO2mv(L-NAME–CONTROL) = -5.0 ± 1.0 mmHg; P &lt; 0.05] compared to control.  In Chapter 5 we focused on the kinetics of bulk limb blood flow (LBF) to show that a low-pass filter (LPFILTER) developed for LBF data improved the confidence of kinetic analysis by decreasing the standard error of the estimate (SEE ~ 95% confidence interval) for all kinetics parameters compared to the Beat-by-Beat method (e.g., time-constant phase 2: Beat-by-Beat = 16 ± 5 s; LPFILTER = 1.1 ± 0.5 s).  In conclusion, the early increase in QO2 is the main determinant of muscle oxygenation dynamics and NO is essential to maintain the tight coupling of QO2 and VO2 kinetics during exercise.  In this context, application of a LPFILTER to LBF data provides the best confidence for kinetic analysis of bulk QO2 that should facilitate investigations integrating bulk and microvascular QO2/VO2 matching in a variety of settings in health and disease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explored the benefits of one instructional strategy on the development of English skills and on the achievement in academic school areas by linguistically different high school students. The specific strategy chosen was the use of printed instructional materials with native language support in subject matter areas.  The academic performance of adolescent immigrant students having printed instructional materials with native language support in one subject area was compared to their academic performance in the same subject without using native language support. In addition, the study explored qualitatively the perceptions of the use of printed instructional materials with native language support in subject matter areas among learners, their parents, and ESL as well as subject area teachers. &#xd;
	The statistical analysis of linguistically different high school students’ test performance in geometry showed that instructional materials with native language support contributed significantly to the improvement of students’ performance. The comparison of ESL students’ performance with the performance of non-ESL students demonstrated that, on average, ESL students who were lagging behind the non-ESL students before the treatment was applied, outperformed the non-ESL students when native language support was available and then closed the gap between ESL and non-ESL students on subsequent material without native language support. &#xd;
	The student survey demonstrated the ESL students’ preference for having regular subject area textbooks in English containing page by page glossaries and explanations in their native language. Parents’ responses to questionnaires showed that the instructional materials with native language support enabled parents to understand what their children study in school and to help their children with their school work. Both ESL and the majority of geometry teachers noticed the positive changes in their ESL students when ESL students were provided with materials containing native language support. &#xd;
	All parties participating in the research supported the idea of providing adolescent immigrant students with printed instructional materials containing native language support in all academic subject areas, which would require a collective effort of educators in the fields of science, mathematics, social studies, language arts as well as special education teachers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>My doctoral dissertation consists of three fundamental studies: 1) synthesis of biocompatible materials that can be used as microfluidic substrates, 2) characterizing these materials with respect to properties important to microfluidic fabrication, biochemical separations and concentration enrichment, and 3) employing these novel devices for real world applications in bioanalytical chemistry.&#xd;
&#xd;
The surface properties of a substrate will dramatically affect the resolution and efficiency that can be obtained for a specific CE separation. Thus, the ability to modify the surface is very useful in tailoring a microfluidic chip to a specific separation mode. The substrates we have synthesized for microfluidic devices include metal oxide modified poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), poly(ethyleneoxide)-PDMS (PEO-PDMS) coblock polymers, and surfactant coated PDMS. The metal oxide modified PDMS materials we synthesized include silica-PDMS, titania-PDMS, vanadia-PDMS and zirconia-PDMS. The surfaces of these materials were characterized using contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electroosmotic mobility (EOM) measurements. All of the metal oxide modified PDMS surfaces were significantly more hydrophilic than native PDMS, suggesting potential application in separations of biopolymers. In addition to being more hydrophilic the EOF and zeta potential of the channels were stable and quite durable with aging. Well characterized silane chemistry was used to derivitize the surface of the PDMS metal oxide surfaces allowing a number of different functionalities to be placed on the surface. This method has the potential for wide applicability in many different fields, but specifically for the fabrication of microstructures that need specific surface chemistries. &#xd;
&#xd;
We have also made a number of advancements using sol-gel chemistry and laminar flow within microfluidic channels to fabricate nanoporous membranes. Sol-gel patterned membranes are a simple and facile method of incorporating nanoscale diameter channels within a microfluidic manifold. These membranes have been used to perform preconcentration of amino acids, proteins and small particles for further analysis and separation using CE. We are also using these membranes for further study in desilanization and protein recrystallization studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The primary study investigated the use of ractopamine HCl and implants in cull&#xd;
beef cows. Thirty-two cull cows were used to determine the effects of feeding&#xd;
ractopamine HCl and/or implanting on feedlot performance and carcass composition.&#xd;
Cows were individually fed a high concentrate diet for 60 days. Carcass data were&#xd;
collected and carcasses were fabricated. Implanted cows had greater dressing&#xd;
percentages and tended to have heavier hot carcass weights than non-implanted cows.&#xd;
Cows that had been treated with implant and ractopamine HCl tended to be fatter than&#xd;
those not treated. Ractopamine HCl fed cows had more marbling than their&#xd;
contemporaries. The data also indicated that younger cows (&lt; 6 years of age) had greater&#xd;
feedlot performance than the older cows.&#xd;
An experiment was conducted to determine if corn and grain sorghum dried distillers grains could be effective protein supplements for growing cattle. Crossbred heifers (n = 78) were individually fed 2.72 kg·head·-1d·-1 of supplements containing corn, soybean meal, and grain sorghum; or cracked corn and corn distillers grains with solubles; or cracked corn, sorghum distillers grains with solubles, and ground grain sorghum (all formulated to equal 20% CP). Heifers grazed native-grass and were fed&#xd;
smooth broom hay. A digestion trial was done during the last week of the trial. No&#xd;
differences were noted in weight gain or total diet digestibility, however, DMI was less&#xd;
for heifers receiving either distiller’s based supplement. Ninety-six pregnant, mature, spring-calving cows grazing native grass pasture&#xd;
were used to determine if early weaning calves reduced subsequent winter supplementation cost. Previous to the feeding trial, calves had been weaned at 115 or 212 d of age. Cows were fed either 1.4 kg·hd-1·d-1 or 1.27 kg·hd-1·d-1 of a common 45% CP supplement. Cows were supplemented for an average of 110 d of pregnancy. Earlyweaned&#xd;
cows were heavier and had greater body condition scores than contemporaries at the commencement of supplementation. At calving the early-weaned cows fed the lesser supplemental amount had similar body weight and body condition scores as later-weaned cows fed the greater amount of supplement, thus, the early weaning routine allowed a 30% savings of winter protein supplement.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Despite multiple interventions and the increase of consumer spending on weight management, weight loss maintenance continues to allude most people.  This study explores women’s narratives and the ways they made meaning of their weight loss and weight loss maintenance experiences.  Examining the processes occurring within the individual and the family context, this study investigated the potential differences between weight loss and weight loss maintenance processes.  A grounded theory approach guided the study design, transcription coding, and data analysis.  The results revealed four categories (cycles and patterns, fluctuations and thresholds, defining self, and contextual connections) emerging from the research participants’ narratives describing their weight loss and weight loss maintenance experiences.  An analytical framework, consisting of the examination of clustered categories using a multifocal lens and a toggling procedure, facilitated the development of multidimensional descriptions of the women’s experiences and guided the process of analysis.  The process of analysis was isomorphic to the process the women used to formulate their narratives.  The women incorporated multiple dimensions of their experiences to create narratives that described and informed their weight loss and weight loss maintenance efforts.  The analysis also revealed that weight loss and weight loss maintenance are multi-dimensional processes.  The dimensions reflect both similarities and differences between the processes.  Some women used heroic while others used integrative efforts to lose weight.  Their efforts impacted the amount of overlap they experienced between the weight loss and weight loss maintenance processes.  Implications for further studies are presented for using the analytical framework to understand the meaning-making processes occurring with weight loss and weight loss maintenance.  Potential clinical implications for addressing weight loss and weight loss maintenance within family and relational contexts are explained.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations in much of the species range have been declining for the last 35 years. I trapped and equipped bobwhite with radio transmitters and tracked them during 2003-2005. I used these data to examine the effects of landscape configuration on survival as well as the habitat association of bobwhite in southeastern Kansas. I used the nest survival model in Program MARK to determine the effects of habitat configuration on weekly survival of radio equipped bobwhite during the Fall-Spring (1 October to 14 April) and the Spring-Fall (15 April to 30 September) at home range and 500 m buffer scales. Individual survival probability for the Fall-Spring period was 0.9439 (S.E. = 0.0071), and the most parsimonious model for the Fall-Spring period at the home range scale was B0 + percent woodland + percent cropland. At the 500 m buffer scale the most parsimonious model was B0 + percent Conservation Reserve (CRP) program land. The weekly survival probability for the Spring-Fall period was 0.9559 (S.E. = 0.0098). At the home range and 500 m buffer scales there were weak associations of habitat to survival during Spring-Fall with the most parsimonious model for both scales B0 + percent other. Using Euclidean Distances to measure distance from animal location to each habitat, I found that habitat selection was occurring during the Spring-Fall (Wilkes λ = 0.04, F 6,36 = 143.682, P &lt; 0.001) and Fall-Spring (Wilkes λ = 0.056, F 6, 29 = 81.99, P &lt; 0.001). During Spring-Fall bobwhite were associated with locations near cool-season grasses and during Fall-Spring preferred locations near woody cover. Bobwhite also showed habitat selection at a second more refined land use classification level for Spring-Fall (Wilkes λ = 0.006, F 16, 26 = 284.483, P &lt; 0.001) and Fall-Spring (Wilkes λ = 0.004, F 16, 19 = 276.037, P &lt; 0.001). During the Spring-Fall, bobwhites were associated with locations near cool-season grass pastures and roads and during Fall-Spring were associated with locations in close proximity to roads and CRP. Understanding the effects of habitat configuration on bobwhite is an important step in developing a broad-scale management plan.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Dynamic viscoelastic and intrinsic viscosity properties of native xanthan, deacetylated xanthan, guar, and their mixtures in dilute solutions were investigated by using an oscillating capillary rheometer. Influence of mixing temperature, deacetylation, and salt concentration on xanthan conformation and interaction with guar were studied in order to provide additional evidence that can be used to elucidate the mechanism of the intermolecular interaction between the two biopolymers, and build up a more detailed rheological understanding of molecular interactions between xanthan and guar gum in dilute solutions.  &#xd;
Synergistic interaction was found at mixing temperatures of 25 and 80 °C, but a stronger synergistic interaction was observed at mixing temperature of 80 °C. The differences in viscosity and elasticity measurements between the two mixing temperatures could be attributed to the degree of disordering of xanthan. For both mixing temperatures, the relative viscosity and elasticity of xanthan and guar blends were higher than the relative viscosity and elasticity calculated for blends assuming no interaction, indicating that intermolecular binding occurred between galactomannans backbone and disordered segments of xanthan. &#xd;
	Deacetylated xanthan exhibited a stronger synergistic interaction with guar than native xanthan. The intrinsic viscosities of deacetylated xanthan-guar mixtures were higher than those calculated from the weight averages of the two individually, whereas the intrinsic viscosities of native xanthan-guar mixtures were lower than those calculated from weight averages of the two individually, demonstrating that intermolecular binding occurred between xanthan and guar gum.&#xd;
Synergistic interaction for both native xanthan-guar mixtures and deacetylated xanthan-guar mixtures in the dilute regime was observed in water and 2 mM NaCl but not in 40 mM NaCl. The results suggest that intermolecular interaction has occurred between xanthan and guar mixtures in water and 2 mM NaCl, but may not occur in 40 mM NaCl and mutual incompatibility may take place. These results also suggest that degree of disordering of xanthan played a critical role in xanthan-guar interaction and may explain the differences in viscosity, elasticity, and intrinsic viscosity measurements between 2 and 40 mM NaCl, and hence, the intermolecular interaction occurred between the backbone of guar gum and the disordered segments of xanthan.</dc:description>

<dc:description>All arthropods share a segmented body plan. Detailed studies on segmentation mechanisms in the long-germ insect Drosophila melanogaster identified a segmentation hierarchy composed of maternal, gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity genes. In this hierarchy, pair-rule genes play an important role to translate gradients of regional information from maternal and gap genes into segmental expression of segment polarity genes. However, our understanding of the role of pair-rule genes in other short-germ insects and basally branching arthropods is still limited. &#xd;
To gain insights into the role of pair-rule genes in short-germ segmentation, I analyzed genetic interactions as well as expression patterns and functions of homologs of Drosophila pair-rule genes in the short-germ insect Tribolium castaneum. Interestingly, despite the pair-rule like expression patterns of Tribolium homologs of almost all eight canonical Drosophila pair-rule genes, only five have a segmentation function. Knock-down of primary pair-rule genes caused asegmental and truncated phenotypes while knock-down of secondary pair-rule genes caused typical pair-rule phenotypes. Epistatic analysis between the genes revealed that primary pair-rule genes form a gene circuit to prepattern a two-segmental unit, and secondary pair-rule genes are downstream targets of the gene circuit.&#xd;
The typical pair-rule phenotypes observed in secondary pair-rule gene RNAi embryos led to a detailed comparative analysis of the role of paired (prd) and sloppy-paired (slp) between Drosophila and Tribolium. This study revealed that prd is functionally conserved while the functional parasegmental register for Tribolium slp is opposite that of Drosophila slp. The fact that the register of slp function has evolved differently in the lineages leading to Drosophila and Tribolium reveals an unprecedented flexibility in pair-rule patterning.&#xd;
Despite this flexibility in pair-rule patterning between Drosophila and Tribolium, segmental expression of engrailed (en) and wingless (wg) at parasegmental boundaries is conserved in both insects. Analysis of double and triple RNAi for pair-rule genes in Tribolium revealed that the primary pair-rule genes even-skipped and runt are redeployed to directly regulate en and wg with prd or slp at parasegmental boundaries. This redeployment of primary pair-rule genes seem to compensate for the apparently fewer number of functional secondary pair-rule genes in Tribolium segmentation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Four variables from the HBM of healthcare behavior were used to examine immunization decision making by the lay public.  Although there was evidence to support the HBM in general, results of these studies suggest that up to 70% of the variance in immunization decision-making could be explained by disease base rates alone.  When there is a main effect of immunization side effects, this effect was entirely within the most severe category of side effect.  In initial four experiments, there was a consistent interaction between the variable of disease type and the variables of disease severity and immunization side effects.  The fifth experiment showed an interaction between disease type and immunization efficacy.  Functional measurement was used to examine the nature of the interaction between the variables of disease base rates and immunization efficacy.  This interaction is neither clearly additive nor multiplicative.  Disease base rate dominates the other variables, although each modifies immunization likelihood somewhat in interaction with disease base rates.  Furthermore, results suggest that participants did not appear to react to the difference between different disease base rates when the probabilities are small.  Participants also did not conceptualize immunization efficacy as a conditional probability.  Suggestions for how to address these issues via decision support were made.  The principle contribution of this study, however, is development of a methodology.  The method developed here investigates the variables of the HBM in an ecologically valid factorial design.  This approach takes the HBM beyond description of variables to provision of prediction and generalizable results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent teacher candidates perceive value in the process of constructing an electronic academic portfolio. This study will also attempt to answer what process teacher candidates used in developing their electronic academic portfolios and what value teacher candidates assign to each of the steps in the process as well as how the teacher candidate intends to use the academic portfolio during the final semester prior to the professional semester. &#xd;
	A qualitative multi-case study was used to conduct the research.  Data collected included a pre and post survey as well as three one-on-one interviews with eleven teacher candidates.  Teacher candidates were also asked to keep an electronic journal to answer the following questions.  &#xd;
1.   Describe the process you used to create your electronic academic portfolio.&#xd;
2.	Describe your personal frustrations with creating your electronic academic portfolio.&#xd;
3.   Describe your personal triumphs with creating your electronic academic portfolio.&#xd;
	The analysis of the data took place throughout the final semester prior to the professional semester, during which time teacher candidates are taking his or her last five restricted methods courses.  The researcher recruited one additional reader in the field of education.  The reader was trained prior to the actual coding day by the researcher to identify themes from the pilot study. &#xd;
•	Theme A: Pride&#xd;
•	Theme B:  Organization&#xd;
•	Theme C:  Technology Skills&#xd;
•	Theme D:  Value&#xd;
•	Other &#xd;
The commonalities were coded by the reader and the researcher.  &#xd;
	The goal of this was to examine teacher candidate perceptions in creating and electronic academic portfolio.  Teacher preparation programs must determine if the process of creating an electronic academic portfolio has positive effectiveness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study examines the mythology of rock and roll stars in film.  To accomplish this the narrative structures and ideological components of films about rock stars were identified and analyzed.  There were two reasons for choosing this film genre.  First, these films are specifically produced for a youth-oriented audience, an age demographic making the transition to adulthood.  Because of this, these films provide commentary about social institutions and cultural values about finding a place in a market-based economy that is not as clearly transparent in other genres.  Second, these films deal with society across historical time periods, starting with the inception of rock and roll in the 1950s through the present time.  Because they cross multiple decades it is possible to analyze how the narrative structure and content of the films change across time and how these changes reflect changes in social conditions.  The narrative structure of these films were identified and analyzed following the methodology laid out by Will Wright in Sixguns and Society (1975).  The five narrative structures that were identified included, in chronological order, the reconciliation plot, the personal revival plot, the personal revival plot tragedy variation, the self-destruction plot, and the rejection plot.  The journey the heroes in each plot take, along with the obstacles they face and how they find their place in society, coincide with historically situated cultural values and social conditions.  Film content was analyzed through assessing how binary oppositions were resolved and the core themes represented.  Both components, the narrative structures and binary oppositions, changed in ways reflective of the historical context in which the films were produced and reinforced particular ideological positions about cultural values, the youth, and the marketplace.  While the hero's journey took different direction within each of the identified plots, they all contained a common thread – the rock star always finds a place in society by conforming to structural conditions instead of working to alter them.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The current study, based solely on teacher-report, provides descriptive data regarding current transition-related instructional practices among Kansas special educators of secondary-aged youth with emotional and behavioral disorders. Students with E/BD are the least likely of all students with disabilities to gain and maintain positive post-school outcomes in the areas of employment, personal-social skills, and community and independent living. Students who demonstrate functional life skills and self-determination skills independent of instruction and directive generally report a higher quality of life than those who are unable. Transition-related instruction specifically addressing functional life skills and self-determination skills may assist these students in their quest for positive post-school outcomes. Research indicating what, if any, transition skills instruction these students receive is not available.&#xd;
Teachers (N = 165) reported a desire to provide transition skills instruction to youth with E/BD (N = 1,076) yet reported having very little transition training (fewer than eight clock hours) and providing very little instruction (less than two hours weekly). Teachers reported that many students with E/BD do not demonstrate life skills and self-determination skills independent of instruction or directive, yet fewer than 11% of the student population had, within their IEP, a goal addressing the specified transition skills. IDEA 2004 regulations mandate that teachers address the transition needs of students with disabilities within a statement of needed transition services, which is not happening with any regularity. The self-determination skills of demonstrating positive social interactions, making appropriate choices and decisions, and employing self-regulation, though often deficits of youth with E/BD, were among the skills mentioned least frequently within the goals of these students.&#xd;
Based on the Pearson r correlation-coefficient analysis no significant relationship was indicated between the number of years of experience of the teachers and the number of minutes of transition instruction teachers provided to this student population. Very few significant relationships existed between the level of independence students reportedly demonstrate each life skill and self-determination skill and a) the amount of transition training the teacher had received and, b) the amount of transition-related instruction teachers reportedly provide. The teacher’s focus has frequently shifted from transition to educational reform.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine secondary-level social science teachers’ reported implicit beliefs about intelligence as measured by Dweck’s Theories of Intelligence Survey, and teachers’ levels of efficacy as measured by Gibson and Dembo’s Teacher Efficacy Survey, in relation to their students’ perception of goal orientation in the classroom as measured by Midgley’s PALS Survey in the classroom.  In addition, this study examined the relationship of students’ gender and self-perceptions of ability to self reported classroom goal orientation.  &#xd;
Participants in this study were high school social science teachers teaching in 17 schools in northeast Kansas (N = 63), and their students enrolled in social science classes (N = 1,214).  The survey instruments were administered during the Spring 2006 semester during regularly scheduled courses.  Data were analyzed using Pearson product-moment correlations, multiple regression, and other statistical techniques.  A statistical level of p &lt; .05 was used for all tests conducted.&#xd;
	Five statistical tests were conducted.  Three of the statistical tests utilized the Pearson product moment correlation:  (1) correlation between teachers’ implicit theories of intelligence and self-efficacy, (2) correlation between teachers’ implicit theories of intelligence and students’ perception of goal orientation in the classroom, (3) correlation between teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ perception of the classroom goal orientation.  Two statistical tests utilized multiple regression analysis:  (1) regression analysis examining teachers’ implicit theories of intelligence and teachers’ self-efficacy as a predictor of students’ perception of the classroom goal orientation, and (5) regression  &#xd;
analysis examining students’ gender and rating of ability as predictors of students’ perceptions of goal orientation in the classroom.  &#xd;
A positive correlation was found between teachers’ theories of intelligence and self-efficacy.  A statistical significance was also found for the relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and their students’ perceptions of the classroom goal orientation based on teachers’ theories of intelligence or self-efficacy.  Statistical significance was not found for students’ ability rating, as a predictor of their perception of the classroom goal orientation. Statistical significance was found for gender as a predictor of students’ perception of the classroom goal orientation, however, practical significance is questionable.  &#xd;
	Several suggestions for additional research and improvement in practice with regard to teachers’ belief systems and student goal structures were offered.  This research provides additional data for teachers and school leaders in helping them understand the role of teachers’ belief systems in fostering student achievement.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The goal of this research study was to identify the factors that influence community college students’ educational attainment as future teachers. In this naturalistic case study, three forms of data collection were used to answer the research question: 1) documents and reports; 2) student surveys; and 3) student interviews. The case for this study was the teacher preparation program at a mid-sized community college, Butler Community College (Butler), in El Dorado, Kansas. The population of the study included 83 elementary education majors enrolled in the teacher preparation program at the community college. Document and report analysis provided a detailed description of the teacher preparation program at Butler Community College, to include Butler’s role in teacher education. Survey analysis provided a demographic profile of the research population, as well as the barrier and support factors that influenced the educational attainment of these elementary education students. Interviews were conducted with a select group from the population (22 students) who had completed all of the education courses at Butler Community College and were ready to transfer to a four-year teacher education program. Interview analysis provided a detailed demographic profile of participants, as well as a more detailed description of the specific barriers and supports elementary education students experienced while attending Butler. &#xd;
The barriers and support factors were categorized as: 1) institutional barriers or supports; 2) instructional barriers or supports; and 3) personal barriers or supports. The greatest barriers students experienced were personal barriers, such as time management and financial issues. The major institutional barrier was lack of staff support, primarily advising support. Instructional barriers, such as the irrelevance of general education curriculum or problems with a specific course curriculum, were only minor barriers for students. The greatest overall support students experienced at the community college was in the form of instructional support, both faculty support and practical education coursework with accompanying field experiences. The major institutional support was staff support, namely, advising. Family support was cited as the major personal support.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Effects of energy supply on the efficiency of methionine and leucine utilization in growing steers were evaluated in 3 studies.  We hypothesized that increased energy supply would improve efficiency of amino acid utilization. In study 1, treatments were abomasal infusion of 0 or 3 g/d of L-methionine and supplementation with 3 amounts of energy (0, 1.3, and 2.6 Mcal GE/d) in a factorial design. Nitrogen balance was increased (P&lt;0.05) by methionine supplementation and increased linearly (P&lt;0.05) with energy supply, indicating that efficiency of methionine use was improved by energy supplementation.  In study 2, the effects of supplementation with no energy or isocaloric (1.3 Mcal GE/d) supplementation with glucose, fat, acetate, or propionate at 2 levels of L-methionine supplementation (0 or 3 g/d) were evaluated. Supplemental energy increased (P&lt;0.01) nitrogen retention, without differences among energy sources.  The results indicated that energy supplementation improved the efficiency of methionine utilization, independent of energy source.  In study 3, effects of energy supplementation on leucine utilization in growing steers at 2 body weights (150 kg in Exp. 1 and 275 kg in Exp. 2) were evaluated.  Treatments were a 3 Ã 2 factorial with 0, 4, or 8 g/d of L-leucine infused abomasally and 2 amounts of energy (0 and 1.9 Mcal GE/d). In Exp. 1, nitrogen retention linearly increased in response to leucine supplementation when additional energy was supplied.  When no energy was supplemented, nitrogen retention was similar for 4 and 8 g/d of leucine.  Energy supplementation increased nitrogen retention (P&lt;0.01), indicating that energy supplementation improved the efficiency of leucine utilization by modestly increasing nitrogen retention when leucine was limiting and by increasing the ability of steers to respond to the highest amount of supplemental leucine.  In Exp. 2, nitrogen retention was not affected by leucine supplementation, indicating that leucine did not limit protein deposition.  Energy supply increased nitrogen retention (P&lt;0.01) independent of the level of leucine supplemented, demonstrating an increase in capacity for protein deposition when energy was supplemented.  Overall, our results indicated that energy affects the efficiency of amino acid utilization, challenging the assumption of a constant efficiency of use.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As students are required to learn more and more and the world of technology evolves with access to information, how can schools use this knowledge to help students learn?  This project focuses on the development of a prototype tool to assist students in building a vocabulary over time.  The tool will allow students to capture definitions using research based graphic organizers.  It also has a variety of ways students can represent the new words non-linguistically – graphically, audio, adding a variety of files.  &#xd;
A prototype of this tool was developed and expert teachers reviewed the tool for functionality.  Students were also asked to review the tool. After revisions were made students were asked to use the tool in class in a preliminary field test.  Students were then asked their opinion on how they felt this tool would help them learn.&#xd;
This study involved four students and their experiences using the Knowledge Banks.  The students overwhelmingly felt the tool would help them to organize their information, give them easier access to finding the information at a later date, and allow them ways to represent the new information non-linguistically.  They enjoyed the ability to search for terms and find all the information that was connected to this term in any way.  Having all of this information allowed them to make connections with their information they hadn’t done before. &#xd;
The implications of this study on education include; the need to provide ways for students to collect and build their knowledge, giving them access to tools for storage, allowing them to search their knowledge therefore making connections to new learning.  This study showed that a tool can be developed that will help students learn new vocabulary and allow students to continue to learn this vocabulary by revisiting the terms over and over again year after year.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study, based on customer-based brand equity (Keller, 1993), sought to identify key brand associations in brand knowledge and investigated attendees’ behaviors as evidenced in a comparison of a professional association’s major and regional conferences. The points of comparison were brand satisfaction, updated expectation of brand value (UEBV), brand trust, and attitudinal brand loyalty (ABL), especially the mediating effect of UEBV on brand trust-ABL link and the moderating effect of behavioral brand loyalty (BBL) within the brand trust-(UEBV)-brand loyalty link.&#xd;
To identify the proposed paths and differential effect of brand knowledge across I-CHRIE annual conference (IC) and regional CHRIE conferences (RC), this study sampled I-CHRIE members attending IC and/ or RC, using an online survey system. The response rate was 20.1% (213 out of 1,036) for IC and 19.4% (201 out of 1,036) for RC. Confirmatory factor analysis and/or structural equation modeling were used to test construct validity and hypotheses.&#xd;
Findings showed that professional education, staff service, site selection, and social networking are positively related to brand satisfaction, whereas brand awareness is negatively associated with it. Because brand satisfaction is a starting point in affecting UEBV, brand trust, and ABL, these four brand associations are presumed to be major sources of the differential effect of brand knowledge between IC and RC. Also, positive relationships existed on each path for brand satisfaction-UEBV, UEBV-brand trust, brand satisfaction-brand trust, and brand trust-ABL. It is especially important to look at the mediating effect of UEBV on brand satisfaction-brand trust path. UEBV was found to serve as a partial mediator on the brand satisfaction-brand trust path across the two groups. This result suggests that brand trust, the firm expectation that the brand will perform according to its promise, builds up through UEBV as well as through brand satisfaction.&#xd;
This study further extended the proposed theoretical model by dividing it into high and low BBL groups designed to unveil the differential characteristics or mechanisms between two groups. Except for the brand trust-ABL path, BBL was found to moderate the direct path (brand satisfaction to brand trust) and the indirect path (brand satisfaction to brand trust via UEBV).&#xd;
These findings support the notion that since high BBL attendees sustain longer relationships with a particular conference than low BBL attendees, high BBL attendees experience more cumulative satisfaction and update favorable expectations of brand value (through the perception of more [relational] benefits), thereby solidifying expectations about confidence in a brand (brand trust).&#xd;
Brand loyalty holds invaluable benefits for associations when associations in similar disciplines compete for potential attendees. Benefits from brand loyal customers lower marketing costs and increase market share and profitability. Thus, associations should build their conference marketing and management on brand loyalty by carefully designing brand associations attendees consider important. Persistent delivery of high-quality education programs, venue selection, and social networking enables associations to obtain cumulative satisfaction, UEBV, brand trust, and consequently brand loyalty. Retention of brand loyal attendees induces deep commitment to the conferences and great resistance to other conferences’ marketing strategies, thereby contributing to high revenue and market share.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Results of an extensive experimental program conducted to determine the material, bond characteristics, and time-dependent deformations of a proposed self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mixture for bridge girders are presented.  This research program was completed in a three-step process.  The first phase consisted of 15 full-scale, pretensioned SCC flexural specimens that were tested to evaluate their transfer and development lengths.  These specimens included both single-strand and multiple-strand beams, as well as specimens designed to evaluate the so-called “top-strand" effect.  The top-strand specimens, with more than 20 inches of concrete below the strand, were tested to evaluate the current American Association of State Highway Officials requirement of a 30% increase development length when the concrete below the strand is more than 12 inches.  Strand end-slip measurements, used to estimate transfer lengths, indicated the proposed SCC mixture meets ACI and AASHTO requirements.  In addition, flexural tests confirmed the proposed SCC mixture also meets current code requirements for development length.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The second step was to evaluate the elastic shortening, creep, and shrinkage properties of the proposed SCC mixture for bridge girders.  Four bridge girders with an inverted-T profile were used to measure these time-dependent deformations.  In two of the specimens, the strands were tensioned to 75% of ultimate tensile strength (representing a girder that would be put into service).  Strands of the other two specimens were left untensioned to evaluate shrinkage effect of the concrete alone.  The shrinkage was then subtracted from the fully tensioned specimens and elastic shortening and creep were isolated after relaxation losses were calculated from code expressions.  In addition, the fully tensioned specimens were used to determine transfer lengths of the prestressing strand.&#xd;
&#xd;
The final step in the program was to record strain measurements in actual bridge girders used in the field.  Elastic shortening, creep, and shrinkage prestress loss results of the proposed SCC mixture were compared with current design equations.  Instrumentation of seven pretensioned girders in a five-span bridge located in Cowley County, Kansas, was used to measure time-dependent deformations.  Three of these girders utilized SCC, while the other four were cast with conventional concrete.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Deep ultraviolet (UV) photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy has been employed to study optical properties of AlGaN alloys, undoped and doped AlN epilayers and nanostructure AlN photonics crystals (PCs). Using a deep UV laser system with an excitation wave length at 197 nm, continuous wave PL, temperature dependent, and time-resolved PL have been carried out on these AlGaN and AlN epilayers and nanostructures. &#xd;
We have measured the compositional and temperature dependence of the energy bandgap of AlxGa1-xN alloys covering the entire alloy range of x, 0 â¤ x â¤ 1 and fitted with the Varshni equation.  Varshni coefficients, alpha and betaï¬ in AlGaN alloys have a parabolic dependence with alloy concentration x. Based on the experimental data, an empirical relation was thus obtained for the energy gap of AlGaN alloys for the entire alloy concentration and at any temperature below 800 K.&#xd;
The exciton localization energy in AlxGa1-xN alloys the entire composition range (0 â¤ x â¤ 1) has been measured by fitting the band edge emission peak energy with the Varshni equation. Deviations of the excitonic emission peak energy from the Varshni equation at low temperatures provide directly the exciton localization energies, ELoc in AlGaN alloys. It was found that ELoc increases with x for x â¤ 0.7, and decreases with x for x â¥ 0.8. The relations between the exciton localization energy, the activation energy, and the emission linewidth have been established. It thus provides three different and independent methods to determine the exciton localization energies in AlGaN alloys.&#xd;
Impurity transitions in AlGaN alloys have also been investigated. Continuous wave (CW) PL spectra of Si and undoped AlGaN alloys reveals groups of impurity transitions that have been assigned to the recombination between shallow donors and an isolated triply charged cation-vacancy (VIII)3-, a doubly charged cation-vacancy-complex (VIII-complex)2-, and a singly charged cation-vacancy-complex (VIII-complex)-1. The energy levels of these deep acceptors in AlxGa1-xN (0 â¤ x â¤ 1) alloys are pinned to a common energy level in the vacuum. AlGaN alloys predominantly exhibiting the bandedge and (VIII-complex)1- transitions possess improved conductivities over those emitting predominantly (VIII)3- and (VIII-complex)2- related transitions. These results thus answer the very basic question of high resistivity in Al-rich AlGaN alloys.&#xd;
Acceptor doped AlGaN alloys have been studied by deep UV PL. A PL emission line at 6.02 eV has been observed at 10 K in Mg-doped AlN. It is due to the recombination of an exciton bound to the neutral Mg acceptor (I1) with a binding energy, Ebx of 40 meV, which indicates large activation energy of the Mg acceptor. The observed large binding energy of the acceptor-bound exciton is consistent with relatively large binding energy of the Mg acceptor in AlN.&#xd;
With the energy level of 0.51 eV for Mg dopants in AlN, it is interesting and important to study other suitable acceptor dopants for AlN. Growth and optical studies of Zn-doped AlN epilayers has been carried out. The PL spectra of Zn-doped AlN epilayers exhibited two impurity emission lines at 5.40 and 4.50 eV, which were absent in undoped epilayers. They are assigned respectively, to the transitions of free electrons and electrons bound to triply positively charged nitrogen vacancies (0.90 eV deep) to the Zn0 acceptors.  It was deduced that the Zn energy level is about 0.74 eV above the valence band edge, which is about 0.23 eV deeper than the Mg energy level in AlN.&#xd;
 Nitrogen vacancies are the compensating defects in acceptor doped AlGaN alloys. A nitrogen vacancy (VN) related emission line was also observed in ion-implanted AlN at 5.87 eV and the energy level of singly charged VN1+ is found at 260 meV below the conduction band. As a consequence of large binding energy of VN1+ as well as high formation energy, VN1+ in AlN cannot contribute significant n-type conductivity, which is consistent with experimental observation.&#xd;
The temperature dependent PL study of the bandedge emissions in GaN and AlN epilayers up to 800 K has been carried out, which reveals two distinctive activation processes.  The first process occurring below Tt = 325 K (Tt = 500 K) for GaN (AlN) is due to the activation of free excitons to free carriers, whereas the second occurring above Tt with an activation energy of 0.29 eV (0.3 eV) for GaN (AlN) is believed to be associated with a higher lying conduction band (ï3) at about 0.3 eV above the conduction band minimum (ï1).  These higher lying bands could affect device performance of GaN and AlN at elevated temperatures.&#xd;
Two-dimensional nanostructured AlN photonic crystals (PCs) with a varying periodicity/diameter down to 150 nm/75 nm have also been studied by deep UV PL.  With PCs formation, a 20-fold enhancement in the band edge emission intensity at 208 nm over unpatterned AlN epilayer has been observed. The emission intensity increases with the decrease in the lattice constant of the AlN PCs. AlN PCs represent photonic crystals with highest (shortest) bandgap (wavelength) semiconductors, which open up new opportunities for exploring novel physical phenomena in the artificially structured photonic band gap material systems and their applications, particularly in the area of deep UV as well as nano-photonics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When adolescents are the subjects of developmental research into prosocial behaviors, the evidence suggests that both peers and parents are contributors to adolescents’ helping behavior.  However, these two predictors are rarely studied concurrently.  The present study explored the relative influence of parents and peers on (1) different types of adolescent helping (i.e., planned and spontaneous) and (2) different targets of spontaneous helping (i.e., friends, non-friends, and strangers) in 51 early (mean age = 12.54 years, 24 boys and 27 girls) and 57 middle (mean age = 16.82 years, 25 boys and 32 girls) adolescents.  Adolescents and their parents completed parallel forms asking them to describe their planned helping as well as a questionnaire assessing past and anticipated future spontaneous helping of friends, strangers, and (for adolescents only) non-friends.  Adolescents also reported their perception of their friendship group’s norm of helping as well as their level of identification with their friendship group.  There was no clear age-related helping pattern, though a sex difference (females were generally more helpful than males) and an effect of target (friends were helped more than non-friends, who were in turn helped more than strangers) found in the adolescents was paralleled in the adults.  Fathers’ planned helping was generally more strongly related to their adolescents’ planned helping than was mothers’ planned helping, though both mothers’ and fathers’ spontaneous helping of friends and family (though not of strangers) was strongly associated with their adolescents’ spontaneous helping.  In contrast to parental variables’ relationship with both adolescent planned and spontaneous helping, peer variables were more consistently related to spontaneous than planned helping.  Implications of the present findings, and proposed directions for future research, are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide, and methane have been increasing since the Industrial Revolution. An expanding human population, increased fossil fuel use, extensive ecosystem disturbance, and intensive production agriculture have contributed to this increase. Storing carbon (C) in soil in natural and agricultural ecosystems has the potential to offset a portion of the future atmospheric increases in CO2 levels. Laboratory and field studies were conducted to evaluate basic mechanisms of C sequestration. The research reported here focuses on identifying strategies to reduce C loss from soil by (1) slowing plant residue decomposition rates, or (2) increasing soil fungal dominance and physical protection of soil C. Grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) hybrids were used in a laboratory experiment to determine the effect of varied amounts of lignin on plant residue C mineralization. The different levels of lignin in the hybrids was not strongly correlated with plant residue C mineralization. Another laboratory experiment investigated larger differences in lignin content between crop plants. Plant residue exhibiting the natural mutation referred to as brown midrib (bmr) also had lowered total lignin and different lignin chemistry. The bmr plants decomposed faster than the normal isolines, and the addition of nitrogen lowered overall mineralization. Nitrogen additions also significantly impacted the microbial community by lowering total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and shifting fungal energy storage physiology. A field experiment was conducted to measure the soil microbial response to adding grain sorghum residue in both tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) agricultural ecosystems. The residue mineralized similarly in both systems, but the NT microbial population was stimulated significantly greater than CT. The fungal PLFA in NT 0-5 cm was higher than NT 5-15 cm, CT 0-5 cm, or CT 5-15 cm. A significantly greater amount of plant residue C was found in soil macroaggregates, as compared to microaggregates, at the conclusion of the experiment, regardless of tillage. More N was found in NT macroaggregates than in CT macroaggregates. The experiment identified two mechanisms for increased C storage in NT soils, as compared to CT soils.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The EU is one of the world’s biggest importers of bananas and, as such, import policies enforced by this trade union are likely to have a great impact on major producers of bananas. Aiming to protect communitarian producers and exporters from selected ex-colonies of Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific and to honor previous agreements, the EU unified its import policy for bananas in 1993. This policy, known as the Common Market Organization for Bananas, generated one of the most controversial trade disputes in history. After several modifications of the original regime, in January 2006, the EU changed its import regime to satisfy a World Trade Organization mandate and to honor an agreement signed with the United States in 2000.&#xd;
This dissertation reviews the history of the trade disputes in the EU banana market and analyzes the effects that the new import regime will have on major suppliers. To do this, a theoretically-consistent demand system is estimated and then the calculated parameters are used to model the effects of the tariff-only import system in the EU banana market. Based on the results, producers surplus are estimated and Monte Carlo simulations are performed to do a sensitivity analysis of the results. &#xd;
In the demand estimation component, the EU market is modeled as a system containing four major suppliers using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS). This estimation fills an important gap in literature regarding the lack of well-estimated demand elasticities of bananas in the EU. &#xd;
The EU banana market is then modeled based on a equilibrium displacement model framework. Results of this analysis are then used to calculate point estimates of producer surplus changes as a measure of the impact of the new import policy on banana suppliers. Monte Carlo simulations are based on parameter estimates obtained from the AIDS model. These simulations allowed not only sensitivity analysis but also probabilistic inferences about the statistical significance of the estimates obtained in the previous components. &#xd;
Results indicate that the hypothesis that the new import regime will not affect the major suppliers of the EU banana market cannot be rejected. This might indicate that the policy enforced by the Common Market Organization for Bananas and the current tariff-only import regime are statistically equivalent. In other words, the EU expertly enacted a tariff level that will leave much as status quo.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This exploratory research project has utilized a mixed-method (Seiber 1973; Creswell 1994, 2005; Jick 1979; Dexter 1970) approach to examine why some NFL players participate in deviant, and sometimes law breaking, behavior and others do not.  Using Dexter’s (1970) qualitative technique of elite and specialized interviewing along with Schatzman’s and Strauss’s (1973) naturalistic field method, access was gained into an exclusive group of current and former NFL players.  The qualitative findings in conjunction with Durkheimian theory provided the conceptualization of a quantitative instrument.  Through a nonprobability snowball sample (Babbie 1986; Berg 2001), 104 NFL players were interviewed.  A series of quantitative analyses were run to describe and assess relationships within this study group.  In essence, this study has entailed a series of steps that could be represented as a cumulative progression. &#xd;
From the qualitative data, the three core themes that emerged were (1) deviance, (2) anomie, and (3) social ties.  Within the study group, a substantial number of players had prior experience with deviant and illegal behaviors.  Many reported problems coping upon entering the NFL and sought to find personal fulfillment and happiness despite wealth and fame.  It appeared that some level of anomie was present in a number of these players’ lives.  However, players that had strong ties to various social groups appeared less likely to succumb to anomie and deviance.  &#xd;
Supporting the qualitative data, the quantitative findings revealed that anomie was one of the significant predictors of law breaking players.  It would therefore appear reasonable to suggest that some of the players were involved in behaviors that could be labeled anomic deviance.  Furthermore, the findings supported the primacy of social ties/support in combating anomie and deviance in the lives of NFL players in the study group.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It has long been believed that how well one reads and writes in his/her first language will help a learner when trying to read and write in a second language.  In an attempt to explore this issue more thoroughly, the researcher administered the Spanish Idea Proficiency Test (IPT) and the English Idea Proficiency Test form 3B, along with a questionnaire obtaining specific demographic data (first semester second language grade, grade point average, gender, grade in school, number of semesters studied the second/foreign language, and the number of languages the student had studied) to 96 Kansas high school students (48 Native Spanish speakers learning English in an English as a second language environment; 48 Native English speakers learning Spanish in a foreign language setting).  &#xd;
First, the researcher wanted to determine if first language literacy skills, along with demographic data, predicted second language proficiency scores.  Using the 5 reading subscales and the 3 writing subscales from the IPT, as well as the 6 variables from the demographic data, a multiple linear regression was run, along with regressions for each subgroup.  It was determined that the 14 variables accounted for 83% of the variance.  &#xd;
Second, the researcher wanted to determine the nature of the relationship between first language literacy skills and second language literacy skills.  To this end, several Pearson’s r were figured.  While a negative relationship for the first and second language proficiency scores was found, a slight positive relationship was found between the first and second language scores for the two subgroups.  Additionally, a significantly positive relationship was found for first and second language reading and writing proficiency scores for the native Spanish speakers.  Also, a significant positive relationship was found for first semester second language grade and second language reading scores for native English speakers.  &#xd;
Third, the researcher wanted to determine if there was a difference between the two subgroups’ second language proficiency scores when controlling for the length of time studied.  When an ANCOVA was conducted, there was found to a significant difference between the proficiency scores of the two subgroups, with the native Spanish speakers having a higher mean.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine what school leaders believe is a suitable funding level for Kansas school districts and to simulate the effect and cost of selected findings. More specifically, three questions were examined: How much money do top leaders in each school district in Kansas believe is needed to provide a suitable education for all students in their school district? What would be a suitable per-pupil funding level for districts when examined by varying enrollment sizes if based on the perceived needs of school district leaders in Kansas? And, what would be the statewide cost to implement a suitable per-pupil funding level for districts of varying sizes based on the expressed needs of school district leaders in Kansas?&#xd;
To accomplish its purpose, the study was carried out in three phases. First, it examined research in the areas of school finance equity and adequacy, both of which influence how much money is distributed to schools. Second, this study surveyed top school district leaders in Kansas in search of their opinions regarding how much money is needed to provide an adequate and suitable education. Third, survey data provided the basis for selected simulations designed to estimate the effect and cost of proposed changes on individual school districts and the state of Kansas.&#xd;
The results of this study show that school district leaders widely believe more money is needed to meet performance mandates for regular education students, at-risk students, and bilingual students. When considering only regular education students, this study found that school leaders believe the state of Kansas is underfunding schools by $577 million. In addition, this study shows that at-risk students need an additional $246.6 million to be provided an adequate education, while bilingual student show nearly another $18 million of need.&#xd;
Some school districts in Kansas have managed to offset the perceived under-funding by utilizing local tax options beyond base state funding. These local options, however, are subject to voter approval and lead to concern by some over equitable and adequate funding for all school districts in Kansas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Viruses differ in their susceptibility and resistance to disinfectants and their ability to be inactivated based predominantly on structural and size differences. The virucidal methodology followed in this study was consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for such efficacy testing. Various disinfectant chemistries were effective in rapid and complete inactivation of bovine coronavirus (BCV) including 25, 50, and 100% DF-200d, 10% bleach, 1% Virkon® S, and 70% ethanol following 10 min treatments. Efficacy was slightly reduced in the presence of organic challenge material (feces, soil). Treatment with 100% DF-200d or 10% bleach resulted in the degradation of BCV RNA. Treatment with 50 or 100% DF-200d, 10% bleach, or 1% Virkon® S resulted in the degradation of BCV proteins as detected by western blot analysis. Various disinfectants were effective in the complete inactivation of both mammalian and avian influenza test strains and included DF-200d, 10% bleach, 1% Virkon® S, and 70% ethanol following 10 min exposure but was reduced in the presence of organic challenge. Treatment with DF-200d or 10% bleach resulted in significant degradation of influenza RNA. Effective treatments against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and bovine enterovirus-2 (BEV-2) included 10% bleach, 4% sodium carbonate, 2% sodium hydroxide, and Sandia DF-200. Treatment with 5% acetic acid was effective against FMDV, but not BEV-2. Treatment with 70% ethanol was not effective for inactivating FMDV or BEV. Additionally, 10 min treatment with 10% bleach, 2% sodium hydroxide, and Sandia DF-200 degraded FMDV and BEV-2 RNA. FMDV inoculated surfaces were exposed to 5% acetic acid, 10% bleach, 70% ethanol, 4% sodium carbonate, 2% sodium hydroxide, Sandia DF-200, 0.4% Oxy-Sept® 333, or 1% Virkon® S. All treatments except 70% ethanol were effective following 10 and 20 min contact on rubber and stainless steel. No treatments were shown to be effective for concrete, due to a low recovery of virus from this surface. Additionally, 10 and 20 min treatments with 10% bleach, 2% sodium hydroxide, and Sandia DF-200 degraded FMDV RNA on the surfaces evaluated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Medical and psychological responses of patients recovering from surgery were evaluated in hospital rooms with ornamental indoor plants. Three clinical studies were conducted in two hospitals with 80 thyroidectomy patients, 90 appendectomy patients, and 90 hemorrhoidectomy patients.  Patients in each surgical procedure were randomly assigned to either control or plant rooms. Eight species of foliage and flowering plants were placed in the hospital rooms during the recovery period following surgery until discharge. Data collected from each patient included length of hospitalization, analgesics used for postoperative pain control, vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate), ratings of pain intensity, pain distress, anxiety and fatigue (PPAF), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-1 (STAI-Y1), the Environmental Assessment Scale (EAS), and the Patientâs Room Satisfaction Questionnaire (PRSQ). Effects were assessed by analysis of covariance and the exact chi-square test.&#xd;
Patients in the plant rooms had significantly more positive health outcomes than those in the control group with no plants. Patients exposed to plants experienced shorter hospitalizations, fewer intakes of postoperative analgesics, more positive physiological responses, and less pain, anxiety, and fatigue than patients in the control group. Patients with plants also felt more positively about their rooms and evaluated them with higher satisfaction as compared to those in the control group. Based on patientsâ comments, plants brightened up the room environment, reduced stress, and also conveyed positive messages of the hospital caring for patients. Findings of this study confirmed the therapeutic value of plants in the hospital environment as a noninvasive, inexpensive, and effective intervention for surgical patients in a general hospital ward.  Outcomes of this study will substantially affect patientsâ and hospital administratorsâ decisions that indoor plant intervention can foster improved medical outcomes, increase satisfaction with providers, and be acceptably cost effective as compared to other alternatives.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Study of Principals’ Perceptions of Competence in Common Administrative Roles is quantitative. All Kansas principals were surveyed using the Principal’s Perception of Competence Survey, an instrument developed by the researcher, to gather the quantitative data.&#xd;
The issues surrounding the principalship are varied and complex. Many researchers would contend that building principals and the leadership they provide have more impact on school effectiveness than any other person or program. Whether they are beginning or experienced administrators, research suggests that principals must feel confident in their abilities if they are to be effective and make a strong impact on effective school functioning.&#xd;
The current and future shortage of quality principals is well documented. The present study was designed to identify common administrative roles and responsibilities in which beginning and experienced principals lack competence. In particular, the study identifies and addresses areas in which additional preparation and training of principals should be dedicated, which will assist preparatory programs and school districts. The results of this study will assist professors in university-based leader preparation programs, school district superintendents, and other school district personnel in developing university and site-based programs of preparation and support designed to retain quality school leaders.&#xd;
	The findings of the study are organized around three research questions throughout Chapters IV and V. Discussions of the findings, as well as recommendations for future studies are also organized around the research questions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The strategic decision a firm makes in determining where to set its vertical and horizontal boundaries is a widely discussed topic in the literature.  This strategic decision can include vertical integration, horizontal integration and diversification outside of the food economy.  These activities can impact a firm in different ways.&#xd;
The objective of this research is to determine whether food economy firms pursuing diversification or integration are valued lower or higher as a whole than the sum of their individual segments.  This is commonly referred to as a premium or discount.  The hypothesis is that a premium exists for food economy firms that pursue integration activities and a discount exists for food economy firms that pursue diversification activities.  Four separate food economy sectors are used in the analysis: food processing, wholesale grocery, retail supermarkets, and restaurants.&#xd;
To determine whether a premium or discount exists for integration or diversification, an excess value calculation method is used which compares the actual value of a firm to the imputed value of all of the segments of a firm.  This excess value is then used in a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) framework to determine how certain firm characteristics influence firm value.  But, these firm effects may both lead a firm to diversify or integrate and affect firm value.  This would incorrectly attribute a premium or discount to the diversification or integration itself and not the underlying firm characteristics that caused the firm to pursue such a strategy.  To account for these underlying firm and industry characteristics, Heckman’s two-stage procedure is used to control for the self-selection of firms that diversify.&#xd;
The SUR results indicate that the hypothesis that integration leads to a premium for food economy firms cannot be rejected for the restaurant sector and for the processing sector except in the case of vertical integration into retail.  The endogeneity tests indicate that, in most cases, the diversification or integration decisions are endogenous meaning that the firm effects that cause firms to diversify or integrate are positively or negatively correlated with firm value.  In the cases of vertical integration into wholesale in the processing and restaurant sectors and unrelated diversification in the restaurant sector, including a self selection parameter makes the premiums found using SUR become discounts.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation was designed to evaluate antimicrobial, quality, and shelf life effects of controlled phase carbon dioxide (CPCO2) on beef trimmings destined for ground beef. Critical parameters included pressure, temperature, exposure times, modified atmosphere conditions, and days of simulated retail display.&#xd;
1500 psi CPCO2 for 15 min achieved 0.83, 0.96, 1.00, and 1.06 log reductions for Total Plate Count (TPC), Generic E. coli (GEC), E. coli O157:H7 (O157), and Salmonella spp. (SS), respectively. Bacterial reductions in ground beef and beef trimmings were similar (P≥0.05). &#xd;
CIE L*, a*, and b* values in raw patties showed no differences (P≥0.05) immediately after CPCO2 application on beef trimmings. Nevertheless, significant (P&lt;0.05) interactions were found in pressure by packaging for L*, in pressure by packaging by days of simulated retail display for a*, and in packaging by days of simulated retail display for b* scores. Nevertheless, after 5 days of simulated retail display, L*, a*, and reflectance (630/580nm) ratios were similar for all treatments (P≥0.05), and b* scores were most acceptable with 1500 CPCO2 (P≥0.05), regardless of the packaging conditions.&#xd;
After 5 days of display, cooked patties showed similar (P≥0.05) values for crude protein (%CP) and crude fat (%CF), the extent of lipid oxidation (TBARS), was higher (P0.05) in aerobic trays than flushed packages with 100% CO2. &#xd;
Ground beef patties manufactured from beef trimmings treated with CPCO2scored higher values for tenderness (P0.05) than other treatments. In addition, no differences (P0.05) for juiciness, beef flavor intensity, or off flavor intensity were found between non-treated and the 1500 psi CPCO2 treated patties. &#xd;
Microbial control of spoilage organisms and foodborne pathogens in ground beef patties with CPCO2 application in beef trimmings was effective (0.6 to 1.2 logs). Lethality levels are comparable to other intervention strategies. Discoloration of beef trimmings after CPCO2 application may not be a concern for grinding purposes. Further packaging with 100% CO2 is viable for controlling spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms after packaging and during refrigerated storage, although discoloration of raw ground beef patties packaged with 100% CO2 may be a concern for product marketing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The chief aim of this research is to assess the influence of rural amenities on population change amongst all non-metropolitan counties in the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) from 1980 to 2000.  Rural amenities, as defined by this research, are the attributes of a non-metropolitan locale that enhance the quality of life of the people living or visiting there.  First, I discuss the general patterns of population change in non-metropolitan areas during these three decades as well as the possible influence of rural amenities during this time period.  I then examine how rural amenities have been studied by past research in order for me to hypothesize their influence on non-metropolitan population change in the United States.   Additionally, I draw on past research in order to guide my conceptualization and measurement of rural amenities.  Using data from the United States Census of Population, the National Outdoor Recreational Supply Information System (NORSIS), and David McGranahan’s (1999) Natural Amenity Scale, a panel model data set was constructed for the aforementioned counties from 1980 to 2000.  This research constructed a panel data set using data from the aforementioned sources for the years of 1980-2000.   Accordingly, in this model the change scores on two measures of population change (absolute population change and percentage population change) were regressed on the amenity and control variables.   Regression diagnostics were then used to examine the extent to which specific regression assumptions were validated by the data.  Results suggest that climatic amenities, river and ocean based amenities, and warm weather recreational amenities were most significantly associated with increase in population amongst the counties examined by this study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A series of experiments were conducted evaluating the effects of marker selection and mix time on feed uniformity, feed uniformity on animal performance, and the addition of cracked corn to a concentrate pellet on broiler performance.  Utilizing a common corn-soybean meal based poultry diet, as mix time increased, there was an overall decrease in % Coefficient of Variation (CV) observed, which was independent of which marker was used.  Crude protein should be considered to be an inferior marker as several ingredients in the batch contribute some level of protein and overall decreased numerically less than 1% CV.  Synthetic amino acids (methionine and lysine) prevailed as the most consistent markers reducing in magnitude by 60.32% and 55.97% (methionine and lysine, respectively).  &#xd;
To evaluate the effects of feed uniformity on broiler performance, as determined by CV, methionine was added to a basal diet and mixed for 10, 20, 30, 40, or 120-s, with methionine being the only ingredient varying.  During the starter period (d 0 to 16) ADG increased significantly (quadratic P&lt;0.001) as well as F:G (quadratic P&lt;0.001).  However, in overall (d 0 to 41) growth performance only ADG improved (quadratic P&lt;.001).  Average daily feed intake appeared to be a contributing factor in growth performance for all stages of growth.  &#xd;
Cracked corn was added to a concentrated pellet to evaluate growth performance on broilers and potential cost reductions at the feed manufacturing facility.  A linear decrease was observed overall (0 to 41 d) for ADG, ADFI, and F:G (P&lt;0.003, respectively).  Gizzard weight and gizzard yield were significantly increased (P&lt;0.043 and P&lt;0.008, respectively) as cracked corn level increased.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In many college of education programs, the feasibility of online courses has provided opportunities for in-service teachers who are pursuing a higher educational goal while working full-time with school and/or family responsibilities.  Although preliminary evidence on project-based learning (PBL) in traditional classrooms with younger learners suggests that students are highly motivated, it is not clear whether adult learners recognize the value of the online PBL approach.  This study documented adult learners’ learning experience with online projects, their collaborative experience, and their learning experience with technological tools.  The result of this study can contribute to our understanding of the strengths and the obstacles in an online PBL environment.  &#xd;
	Nineteen participants who registered in a graduate level course participated in this case study over a 16-week semester.  They collaborated in small group of 2–5 members in order to communicate and construct projects at a distance.  Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and interpreted based on a descriptive case study design.  Multiple sources of data include course documentation, archival data from course management system, student-created projects, surveys, and interviews.  A model for content analysis of CMC was applied to qualitative analysis of  the electronic discourse.  &#xd;
	Findings of this study indicated that participants gained positive experience in this new way of learning.  In particular, three themes related to online PBL approach emerged: (1) project relevancy and authenticity as the primary concerns in guiding driving question, researching information, and constructing artifact; (2) synchronicity is indispensable for online collaboration; and (3) repeated exposures with technology tools reduce the fear and reinforce the skill to be learned.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In many experiments involving a magneto-optical trap (MOT) it is of great importance to know the fraction of atoms left in an excited state due to the trapping process.  Generally speaking,&#xd;
researchers have had to use overly simplistic and untested models to estimate this fraction.  In this work, the excited fraction of 87Rb atoms in a MOT is measured using a model-free approach.&#xd;
A simple model is fit to the fractions which were obtained for a range of MOT parameters. Using the results of this work, the excited fraction of 87Rb atoms trapped in a MOT can be accurately estimated with knowledge of only the trapping laser intensity and detuning. The results are only weakly dependent on other MOT parameters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study utilized an ecobehaviorial approach to investigate the relationship between English language learner language use in middle school content area classrooms and instructional grouping configurations.  The participants in the study included 28 native Spanish-speaking students who attended urban middle schools. These students were all identified as being English language learners (ELL) in need of English as a second language support services.  &#xd;
This study used the Ecobehavioral System for the Complex Recording of Interactional Bilingual Environments (ESCRIBE) software to record data regarding contextual factors and ELL student behavior using 15 second momentary time sampling in mathematics, social studies, science, reading, and language arts classes.  The program analyzed this data to determine conditional probabilities of various student behaviors given each contextual factor.  The focus contextual factor of this study was instructional grouping configurations: whole class, small group, one-to-one, and individual instruction. The focus student academic responses included academic language production (writing, reading aloud, and talk academic), academic language reception (reading silently, student attention, and other academic), and other non-academic responses.  In this study, the participants were most likely to produce academic language during small group and one-to-one instruction.   They were least likely to engage in academic talk during whole class and individual instruction.  If teachers want to encourage ELL students to produce academic language, they should consider using more small group and one-to-one instructional grouping configurations.</dc:description>

The objective of this work is to investigate the formation of unique thin films on the two metals and to probe the surface chemistry of these films through the use of core level and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).&#xd;
    Chromium forms a wide array of oxides and can exist at several valencies. Valence band XPS is used in conjunction with band structure and multiple scattered wave X[alpha] calculations to distinguish which states are present in the resultant films. Both 99.99% chromium and 316L stainless steel foils were treated with orthophosphoric acid and 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid, otherwise known as etidronic acid. Two methods developed in the Sherwood research laboratory for forming oxide-free films on metal surfaces are utilized in this work.&#xd;
    Core level XPS results did not provide sufficient information to draw conclusions regarding the products formed in the reactions.  The valence band results showed clear evidence of multiple forms of phosphates forming on the metal surfaces as evidenced by the subtle differences in separation between the phosphorous 3p and 3s peaks as well as differences in separation between the O2s and phosphorous 3s peaks. The Valence Band XPS results were interpreted by X-[alpha] cluster and band structure calculations. &#xd;
    Films formed on chromium foil from the orthophosphoric acid were found to be condensed phosphates that are stable in air.  Etidronic acid formed very thin phosphate films on chromium with both treatment methods as well as on 316L stainless steel when the bench top method was applied.  Treatment of etched 316L steel in the anaerobic cell generated an etidronate film. This sample was the only etidronate film formed, all other etidronate-based films were generated from disassembled portions of the etidronate ion to form phosphate films.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), and house fly, Musca domestica L., are two major pests affecting both confined and pastured livestock in the United States. It costs livestock producers millions of dollars annually to reduce populations of these two pests.  Control of stable flies and house flies based on chemical insecticides is only marginally effective and unsustainable in the long term due to the development of insecticide resistance. This has created a demand for alternative methods which are environmentally friendly and cost effective for the management of these pests. Information on stable fly and house fly oviposition behavior and the aggregation and segregation of their immatures may help in an integrated pest management control program for these pests.&#xd;
This research identified specific bacterial species from the surface of stable fly eggs which are suspected of releasing chemical cues used to induce gravid females to oviposit at sites where eggs have been deposited and inhibit additional deposition of eggs in the same habitat when it is already colonized.  My research also showed that stable fly and house fly larvae tend to be aggregated in distribution, even in apparently homogenous habitats, and to be spatially segregated from each other. Finally, I evaluated the vector competence of stable flies for an emerging food-borne pathogen, Enterobacter sakazakii, showing that this fly species is potentially a good vector for this pathogen.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Baculoviridae is the only known virus family that encodes genes with homology to vertebrate and invertebrate fibroblast growth factors (fgfs), key regulators of developmental processes affecting cell growth, differentiation, and motility. The role of viral fgfs during infection is not known.&#xd;
In this study, we investigated gene regulation and function of the Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) fgf during infection of permissive insect cells. We demonstrated that the AcMNPV fgf, vfgf, was transcribed as a 0.6-kb mRNA at early times post infection, but as part of a 1.4-kb bicistronic mRNA at late times. To determine its function, we examined common characteristics between vFGF and&#xd;
other well-characterized FGF homologs. vFGF had strong affinity to heparin, a property important for FGF signaling via an FGF receptor. vFGF was secreted into the extracellular fluid when expressed in insect cells, suggesting that it acts as an extracellular ligand. Finally, vFGF was able to stimulate chemokinesis of different types of insect cells.&#xd;
We also constructed a recombinant of AcMNPV lacking a functional vfgf and analyzed it in two insect cell lines. The kinetics of budded virus production were similar in the parental and vfgf-deficient viruses in two cell lines and at both high and low multiplicities of infection. In addition, we observed no obvious differences in the viral DNA synthesis and the protein kinetic profiles of cells infected with the mutant and&#xd;
parental viruses. Finally, coinfection of vfgf-containing and -deficient viruses and their&#xd;
passage for several generations did not reveal a consistent growth advantage for either virus. We propose that vFGF is the signal that directs the motility of uninfected tracheal or blood cells to infected tissues, enabling the virus to infect additional cells and spread systemically in the insect host. This proposal may explain a dispensable role for vfgf during virus infection in cell culture; nonetheless, we expect a distinct phenotypic difference between vfgf-deficient and vfgf-containing viruses during infection in the insect host.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Possibly the most pressing need in highway construction today is the repair or replacement of existing bridges. Due to increased needs and growing traffic, in addition to aging and extensive use, more than 2000 bridges in Kansas alone need to be replaced during the next decade. The majority of these bridges has spans of 100 ft or less, and has relatively shallow profiles. It is becoming increasingly important to implement a standard method for replacement in which the process is expedited and accomplished in cost-effective manner.&#xd;
Requirements for design and construction of concrete bridges have drastically changed during recent years. A main change in design is live-load requirements. &#xd;
Nebraska inverted-T bridge system has gained increasing popularity for its lower weight compared to I-girder bridges. However, there are some limiting issues when using IT system in replacing existing CIP bridges.&#xd;
Implementation of a post-tensioned IT system, which is the focus of this research, is believed to be one excellent solution for the IT deficiencies. Post-tensioning is added by placing a draped, post-tensioning duct in the stems of the IT members. Post-tensioning will lead to a higher span-to-depth ratio than IT system, and will reduce the potential transverse cracks in the (CIP) deck. Finally, the undesired cambers of pretensioned beams will be reduced, because fewer initial prestressing will be needed.&#xd;
This study was intended to explore the behavior of the PT-IT system, identify major parameters that control and limit the design of this system, and investigate different construction scenarios. This was achieved by conducting an extensive parametric study. For that purpose, PT-IT analysis program was developed and written using C++ programming language. The program was used to analyze various post-tensioning procedures for the post-tensioned inverted-T system. A Visual Basic friendly interface was provided to simplify the data input process.&#xd;
The findings of this research included recommendation of construction scenario for PT-IT system, as well as examining different methods for estimating time-dependent restraining moments. Effect of different concrete strengths on the behavior of PT-IT system was also determined. Most importantly, the effect of timing on different construction stages was also evaluated and determined.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Soil C sequestration in agricultural ecosystems is an immediate and significant option to mitigate the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The objectives of this study were to determine 1) the influence of crop and soil management practices applicable to Kansas (i.e., tillage, N fertilization, and crop rotations) on soil C and N, C sequestration rates, soil aggregation and aggregate-associated C and N; and 2) the influence of long-term tillage practices on SOC and total N, soil aggregation and aggregate-associated C and N in three soil types: an Oxisol (Brazil), a Vertisol (Argentina), and a Mollisol (Kansas, USA). The Kansas experiments included: tillage (conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and no-tillage (NT)) and native prairie; nitrogen (N) fertilization rates; and crop rotations comprising various combinations of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), and soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill). The presence of a fallow period negatively affected C sequestration rates even under NT systems. Nitrogen fertilization generally increased C sequestration rates. Rotations that contained wheat or sorghum had the greatest C sequestration rates while continuous soybean had the lowest rates. Cultivation decreased the amount of macroaggregates with a concomitment increased in the amount of microaggregates. Wheat and sorghum increased total C in the macroaggregate fraction (>250 mm) under NT while soybean had the lowest C concentration.  Cultivation reduced microbial biomass C and N and potentially mineralizable C and N. The combination of conservation tillage and rotations that produced a greater amount of residue had greater C sequestration rates. In the Oxisol, NT had greater amounts of large macroaggregates (>2000 mm) than CT, however no differences between tillage practices were detected in the Vertisol and Mollisol. Cultivation of native grassland reduced the amount of macroaggregates and the associated C and N concentration; however NT tended to be more similar to the native grassland. Overall, our results indicated that the use of conservation tillage could be an important strategy to sequester C in these agroecosystems. The adoption of management practices that enhance C sequestration would be important for reducing GHGs emissions and maintaining the sustainability of agricultural systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effects of process conditions on the material’s properties were investigated for the sublimation growth of aluminum nitride and the epitaxial growth of silicon carbide. Since the mid 1990’s, these semiconductors have made new types of high power electronics and short wavelength optoelectronics that were never before feasible. &#xd;
       The sublimation growth of AlN crystals on SiC seeds was carried out to produce high quality AlN bulk crystals. Si-face, 3.5 º off-axis 6H-SiC (0001) and 8 º off-axis 4H-SiC (0001) wafers were used as the substrates. An investigation of the initial growth demonstrated 1800 – 1850ºC was the optimum temperature for AlN growth. By optimizing the temperature gradient, large area AlN layer was deposited. Consecutive growths and continuous growth were performed to enlarge the crystal thickness. Single-crystalline AlN layers, each with a thickness of 2 mm and a diameter of 20 mm, were produced. X-ray diffraction confirmed the grown AlN had good crystal quality. Approximately 3 – 6 at% of Si and 5 – 8 at% of C were detected in the crystals by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which came from the decomposition of SiC seeds and the degradation of the graphite components in the furnace. Molten KOH/NaOH etching revealed the dislocation density decreased from 108 cm-2 to 106 cm-2 as the AlN layer thickness increased from 30 μm to 2 mm.  &#xd;
       Epitaxial growth of SiC was carried out in a chemical vapor deposition system. High-quality 6H-SiC and 4H-SiC homoepitaxial films were produced at growth rates up to 80 μm/hr by using a novel single precursor, methyltrichlorosilane (MTS). Inclusions of 3C-SiC were circumvented by employing 8º mis-orientated substrates. Adjusting the H2/Ar flow ratio in the carrier gas effectively changed the C/Si ratio in the gas phase due to the reaction between H2 and the graphite heater; thereby, influencing surface roughness and dislocation density. Low H2/Ar ratios of 0.1 and 0.125 produced smooth surfaces without step-bunching. Higher H2/Ar ratios of 0.2 and 0.33 enhanced the conversion of basal plane dislocations into threading edge dislocations, and reduced the density of basal plane dislocations to approximately 600 cm-2.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Plants activate innate immune responses or innate immunity upon pathogen infection. There are two types of plant innate immunity: PAMP-triggered innate immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered innate immunity (ETI). The molecular basis for ETI has been well documented. However, the study on PTI and its interplay with pathogen virulence is in its infancy. My research focuses on the interplay between PTI and bacterial virulence in Pseudomonas-Arabidopsis interactions. &#xd;
NHO1, a gene required for nonhost resistance to Pseudomonas syringae, encodes for the 3-glycerol kinase in Arabidopsis genome. NHO1 functions, at least in part, by depriving glycerol from nonhost bacteria cells. NHO1 is induced by a well-known bacteria PAMP flg22. The induction of NHO1 correlates well with the resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci because a mutant strain of P. s. pv. tabaci deficient in NHO1 induction gains partial virulence on Arabidopsis plants. P. s. pv. tomato strain DC3000 induces transient NHO1 expression that is suppressed in a type III secrection system-dependent manner. Using protoplast assay, nine DC3000 effectors that are able to suppress NHO1 were identified. One of them, HopAI1, induces leaf chlorosis and helps nonpathogenic bacterial growth when expressed in Arabidopsis plants, suggesting that HopAI1 has virulence activity in planta. &#xd;
To study AvrB virulence activity in Arabidopsis plants, one mutant compromised in AvrB-specific RAR2.6 induction has been characterized in detail. rrb3 is more susceptible to a nonhost bacteria P. s. pv. tabaci strain 6505, a virulent bacteria P. s. pv. tomato strain DC3000 and an avirulent bacteria strain DC3000 (avrB). The mutant allele rrb3 carries a point mutation at the end of RAR1 CHORD II domain. RRB3 (RAR1), together with NDR1, is involved in the type II nonhost resistance to P. s. pv. tabaci but not in the type I nonhost resistance to P. s. pv. phaseolicola. RAR1 participates in basal resistance against DC3000 by antagonizing COI1 activity. AvrB targets RAR1 to trigger AvrB-dependent leaf chlorosis and enhanced bacterial growth. The AvrB-dependent enhanced bacterial growth but not leaf chlorosis requires COI1, suggesting that AvrB targets JA signaling pathway to promote parasitism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The interaction between dynamic muscle contractions and the associated muscle blood flow is very intriguing leading to questions regarding the net effect of these contractions on oxygen delivery and utilization by the working muscle. Study 1 examined the impact of contractions on muscle blood flow at the level of the femoral artery. We demonstrated that muscle contractions had either a facilitory, neutral, or net impedance effect during upright knee extension exercise as intensity increased from very light to ~70% peak work rate.&#xd;
This led to the question of what impact a change in contraction frequency might have on the coupling of blood flow to metabolic rate during cycling exercise. The blood flow/VO2 relationship has been shown to be linear and robust at both the central (i.e., cardiac output/pulmonary VO2) and peripheral (leg blood flow/leg VO2) levels. However, an increase in contraction frequency has been reported to either decrease, have no effect, or increase the blood flow response during exercise. Study 2 determined if the steady state coupling between muscle blood flow and metabolic rate (centrally and/or peripherally) would be altered by varying contraction frequency. Our results indicate that both central and peripheral blood flow/VO2 relationships are robust and remain tightly coupled regardless of changes in contraction frequency.&#xd;
Study 3 examined muscle microvascular hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation within the contraction/relaxation cycle to determine if microvascular RBC volume was preserved and if oxygen extraction occurred during contractions. We concluded that microvascular RBC volume was preserved during muscle contractions (i.e., RBCs remained in the capillaries), which could facilitate continued oxygen delivery. Further, there was a cyclic pattern of deoxygenation/oxygenation that corresponded with the contraction/relaxation phases of the contraction cycle, with deoxyhemoglobin&#xd;
increasing significantly during the contractile phase. These data suggest that oxygen extraction continues to occur during muscle contractions.&#xd;
Significant insight has been gained on the impact of muscle contractions on oxygen delivery to and exchange in active skeletal muscle. This series of studies forms a base of knowledge that furthers our understanding of the mechanisms which govern the control of skeletal muscle blood flow and its coupling to muscle metabolic rate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The harmful workplace behavior field, although relatively new, is fragmented.  Despite a few collaborative efforts (Fox &amp; Spector, 2005; Keashly &amp; Jagatic, 2003; etc.) there is no agreement on the correct terminology to employ. The current paper corrects this by developing a new scale that is a combination of similar, but previously distinct, variables and concepts.  This new scale is comprehensive and based off of an intensive review of the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are epizootic hosts for plague (Yersinia pestis); however, alternate enzootic hosts are important for the maintenance of the pathogen.  We determined small rodents and prairie dog associations and quantified rodent and flea relationships in the presence and absence of prairie dog colonies and plague. We identified potential alternate hosts and flea vectors for the maintenance and transmission of plague in the prairie ecosystem.  This is the first multi-year study to investigate associations between prairie dogs, rodents and fleas across the range of the black-tailed prairie dog.  Few rodent species associated with black-tailed prairie dogs and were found to be highly abundant on colonies.  Rodent species implicated in plague were present at study areas with and without plague.  Peromyscus maniculatus and Onychomus leucogaster, two widely occurring species, were more abundant in areas with a recent history of plague.  Flea community characteristics varied within each study area in the presence and absence of prairie dogs.  Based on flea diversity on rodents, and the role of rodents and fleas in plague, we identified P. maniculatus and O. leucogaster and their associated fleas, Aetheca wagneri, Malareus telchinus, Orchopeas leucopus, Peromyscopsylla hesperomys, and Pleochaetis exilis to be important for the dynamics of sylvatic plague in our study areas. Peromyscus maniculatus and O. leucogaster were consistently infected with Bartonella spp., another blood parasite.  Presence of prairie dog fleas on other rodents at both off and on prairie dog colonies suggests the potential for intra and interspecific transmission of fleas between rodent hosts, and between other small rodents and prairie dogs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This was a case study of two middle schools in New Mexico. Using organization for instruction (Marks and Louis, 1997) as a crux, the purpose of the building level study was to explore the elements of school leadership, instruction, and middle level program and to infer aspects of language policy. The needs threshold was based on the timeliness of reexamining linguistic diversity and on the importance of language concerns in education, principally as they related to ELLs and other linguistically diverse students. The problem stemmed from dynamic, culturally evolving changes in the environment of the two middle schools under study. Changes from economic factors, district leadership, immigration, and demographic shifts in the local area affected the two buildings’ capacity to effectively deliver educational and language services. The significance of the study maintained that school level language planning was rapidly becoming a competing theme in the process of education and required attention in light of important environmental and sociological factors. Metaphor was employed to help symbolize increasing complexities (e.g., array of special interests, human and individual diversity, etc.) found in context of the school with reference to organization, leadership, instruction, and program.&#xd;
Since the research was a case study, no hypotheses were formulated; instead a major research question and four sub questions were posed. A mixed method, multiple sources of information methodology was used in the collection and analysis of data. Twenty (N = 20) participants made up of building leaders (n = 4) and teachers (n = 16) were interviewed. Tables of student achievement scores were presented along with other demographic data. Although interviewees reported sensitivity to linguistic diversity, findings pointed to a lack of knowledge about language policy at all levels on the part of building leaders and teachers. Implications drawn described the important role language policy formation could play in educational structuring of middle school programs and instruction. A list of recommendations provided criteria to follow in making decisions about the feasibility of conducting school level language planning and made suggestions for further research. An extensive bibliography of relevant sources and transcripts of interviews were provided.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the advent of multi-core processors and rich language support for concurrency, the paradigm of concurrent programming has arrived; however, the cost of developing and maintaining concurrent programs is still high. Simultaneously, the increase in social ubiquity of computing is reducing the "time-to-market" factor while demanding stronger correctness requirements. These effects are amplified with ever-growing size of software systems. Consequently, there is (will be) a rise in the demand for scalable and accurate techniques to enable faster development and maintenance of correct large scale concurrent software.&#xd;
&#xd;
    This dissertation presents a collection of scalable and accurate approaches to tackle the above situation. Primarily, the approaches are focused on discovering dependences (relations) between various parts of the software/program and leveraging the dependences to improve maintenance and development tasks via program slicing (comprehension) and verification.&#xd;
&#xd;
    Briefly, the proposed approaches are embodied in the following specific contributions:&#xd;
   1. New trace-based foundation for control dependences.&#xd;
   2. An equivalence class based analysis to efficiently and accurately calculate escape information and intra- and inter-thread dependences.&#xd;
   3. A new parametric data flow style slicing algorithm with various extensions to uniformly and easily realize and reason about most existing forms of static sequential and concurrent slicing.&#xd;
   4. A new generic notion of property/trace sensitivity to represent and reason about richer forms of context sensitivity.&#xd;
   5. Program dependence based partial order reduction techniques to enable efficient and accurate state space exploration in both static and dynamic mode.&#xd;
&#xd;
    In an attempt to simplify the approaches, they have been based on the basic concepts/ideas of the affected techniques (e.g. program slicing is a rooted transitive closure of dependence relation).  As trace-based reasoning is well suited for concurrent systems, an attempt has been made to explore trace-based reasoning wherever possible.&#xd;
&#xd;
    While providing a rigorous theoretical presentation of these techniques, this effort also validates the techniques by implementing them in a robust tool framework called Indus (available from&#xd;
http://indus.projects.cis.ksu.edu) and then providing experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques on various concurrent applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
    Given the current trend towards concurrent programming and social ubiquity of computing, the approaches proposed in this dissertation provide a foundation for collectively attacking scalability, accuracy, and soundness challenges in current and emerging systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Because it is predicted to be durable and broad spectrum, quantitative trait loci (QTL)-based resistance is an important option for rice disease control. However, manipulation of this type of resistance requires knowledge of the contributing genes. This study demonstrates the contribution of two of three defense response (DR) genes to QTL-governed resistance, and identifies a third gene that negatively regulates resistance. The contribution to QTL-governed resistance of one of nine rice OsPAL genes, which encode phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, was determined using reverse genetics. Mutant ospal4 contains a 750 bp deletion in OsPAL4 and was identified using a PCR-pooling strategy. OsPAL4 underlies a QTL on chromosome 2, and is located in cluster with three other OsPAL members. Rice lines mutated in OsPAL4 are more susceptible to a virulent strain of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) than lines with the wild type allele. RNAi suppression was used to evaluate the contributions of genes encoding oxalate oxidase-like proteins (OsOXL) and a 14-3-3 protein (GF14-e) to disease resistance. Silencing of 12 OsOXL genes clustered on chromosome 8, varied from suppression of a few gene members to silencing of all expressed family members. Screening of transgenic lines by challenge with Magnaporthe grisea (Mg), the rice blast pathogen, revealed that the more chromosome 8 OsOXL genes suppressed, the more susceptible the plants were to Mg. GF14-e co-localizes with a disease resistance QTL on chromosome 2. Specific suppression of GF14-e by RNAi silencing did not result in enhanced susceptibility to Mg. Instead, the lines exhibited spontaneous HR-type lesions. The presence of this lesion mimic phenotype correlated with enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of Xoo, suggesting that the GF14-e encoded 14-3-3 protein functions as a negative regulator of plant cell death and bacterial resistance in rice. This study supports the hypothesis that DR genes, such as OsOXL and OsPAL4 contribute to disease resistance governed by QTL. The role of GF14-e is less clear, however its down regulation may contribute to QTL-governed resistance. Thus, incorporation of regions harboring the effective DR gene alleles into rice will enhance broad spectrum and durable resistance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Unstructured decision making is a dynamic process where an individual must create an alternative because one is not available or provided. In this type of a decision, an individual may not have formed preferences or may not know the path to arrive at a solution. As opposed to selecting from existing alternatives, little research examines when decision makers create an alternative. Electronic commerce websites allow individuals to create a product by customizing it. A web-based simulation called Interactive Choice was developed for the investigation. It is an interactive naturalistic decision space permitting experimental controls such as random placement of participants into conditions and random display of stimuli. Participants customized three products (pizza, cell phones, shoes). Building on theoretical foundations of unfolding model and Image Theory, a model asserts the presentation of the information and preparation of the decision maker influences a decision maker. A phased examination explores decision makers’ cognitive processes by measuring participants’ evaluations of the product created and the process to create it.&#xd;
In the first phase, three experiments find, contrary to previous independent investigations, participants rarely retain a pre-selected default value. Logistic regression reveals that the odds ratio of predicting default retention is dependent on product type. In the second phase, results identify that problem solving instructions influence decision making. Analyses of multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis reveal patterns for default retention and problem solving instructions that define an electronic decision aid called Choice Builder. The dissertation suggests that when an individual creates a product, he or she has more control over the process that subsequently reduces the influence of the default. A new theoretical foundation is proposed identifying that for unstructured decisions individuals construct both decision strategies and preferences while creating an alternative. With an active process of acquiring and evaluating information, an individual forms a decision strategy and updates preferences to achieve an ideal outcome. This dissertation makes four contributions that include 1) a research tool, Interactive Choice, for exploration, 2) the identification of cognitive processes involved, 3) a proposal of a new theoretical approach, and 4) an electronic decision aid, Choice Builder.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this research, proximal measurements of hyperspectral reflectance were used to develop models for estimating chlorophyll content in tallgrass prairie at leaf and canopy scales.  Models were generated at the leaf scale and then extended to the canopy scale. Three chlorphyll estimation models were developed, one based on reflectance spectra and two derived from derivative transformations of the reflectance spectra. The triangle chlorophyll index (TCI) model was derived from the reflectance spectrum, whereas the first and second derivative indices (FDI and SDI)   models were developed from the derivative transformed spectra. The three models were found to be well- correlated with the chlorophyll content measured with solvent extraction. The result indicated that the three models were effective for the leaf scale estimates of chlorophyll content.&#xd;
The three chlorophyll models developed at the leaf scale were further extended to the canopy scale and fine-scale images. The three models were found to be conditionally effective for estimating canopy chlorophyll content. The TCI model was more effective in dense vegetation, and the FDI and SDI models were better in sparser vegetation. This research suggests that the extension of chlorophyll models from the leaf scale to canopy scale is complex and affected not only by soil background, but also by canopy structure and components</dc:description>

<dc:description>Juniperus virginiana, an important woody plant invader in the U.S. Central Plains, has increased considerably in density and cover in large areas previously dominated by tallgrass prairie.  Change in the phenology and nitrogen use efficiency of the dominant plant communities as J. virginiana replaces native prairies may lead to increased plant productivity and biomass accumulation, but may also alter the microclimate and litter quality that affect soil microbial communities responsible for key soil processes.  I have focused my investigations on changes in key soil processes that could lead to differences in soil N availability, as well as changes in ecosystem C and N pools and fluxes as J. virginiana expands into native grasslands.  Juniperus virginiana forest soils exhibit greater cumulative annual net N mineralization (11.52 ± 0.38 µg N g¯1 soil y¯1) compared to prairie soils (7.90 ± 0.26 µg N g¯1 soil y¯1) (F = 60.67, P = 0.016), yet slightly reduced potential soil C flux.  Examination of internal soil N cycling revealed that both J. virginiana and prairie soils minimize potential soil N losses, by rapid microbial immobilization of inorganic N, and constraining nitrification via substrate limitation or environmental constraints.  Leaf-level photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was over a magnitude higher in the dominant grass, Andropogon gerardii, but high annual ecosystem-level NUE and greater soil N availability may contribute to the higher productivity and rapid accrual of C in newly established J. virginiana forests.  Increased plant productivity and elimination of fire in J. virginiana forests have allowed at least 80,000 kg ha-1 increase in ecosystem C storage in about half a century.  Soil organic C, an important long-term sink, has also increased significantly in J. virginiana forests, with approximately 34% replacement of C4 grass-derived soil C with new C from trees in the A-horizon.  The observed high productivity of J. virginiana and increased N availability necessary to support continued plant biomass accumulation are possible because of substantial (~ 44%) increase in ecosystem N in measured pools, which is a likely a result of reduced volatilization of N from biomass burning, possible increased exogenous N inputs, and/or N translocation from deeper soil horizons.  Reduced fire return intervals in prairie provide an opportunity for J. virginiana to establish and facilitate N accrual, which may allow this species to accelerate is own establishment through creating conditions of increased N availability and efficient utilization of N.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This report is based on an exhibition of 37 photographs at the Kemper Gallery in the Student Union of Kansas State University.  All photographs presented here and in the exhibit were created during the past 28 years of my career.  Hence the exhibit is a mid-career retrospective.&#xd;
	My photojournalism experience is very unique in that I am the only photojournalist in the world who has worked as a presidential photographer, published photo essays in National Geographic Magazine as a freelancer, and been on the staff of a large metro newspaper.  The photographs chosen for the exhibit were highlighted by, but not limited to, assignments from those three experiences.  &#xd;
	This report mirrors the exhibit except for a few additional photographs that, because of space limitations, didn’t make it into the final edit for the exhibit.  There are three sections: Moments from Kansas to Papua New Guinea, The Presidency, and After 9/11.  The “moments” section presents a wide variety of photographs from a wide variety of assignments.  The “presidency” section focuses on my tenure as Official White House Photographer for President Reagan, and also includes photographs of the Reagan funeral, other presidents, and a possible future president.  “After 9/11” begins at the Pentagon on 9/12, and then follows the course of events in Afghanistan during the following weeks.&#xd;
	Extensive captions accompany most of the photographs.  The captions are written in the third person which is customary for gallery exhibitions.  More than the who, what, where and when, they provide some additional context and are intended to inform both the journalism student and the layperson.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Usability practitioners need effective usability assessment techniques in order to facilitate development of usable consumer products. Many usability evaluation methods have been promoted as the ideal. Few, however, fulfill expectations concerning effectiveness. Additionally, lack of empirical data forces usability practitioners to rely on personal judgments and/or anecdotal statements when deciding upon which usability method best suits their needs. Therefore the present study had two principal objectives: (1) to validate a hybrid usability technique that identifies important and ignores inconsequential usability problems, and (2) to provide empirical performance data for several usability protocols on a variety of contemporary comparative metrics. The User-Centered Hybrid Assessment Tool (User-CHAT) was developed to maximize efficient diagnosis of usability issues from a behaviorally-based perspective while minimizing time and resource limitations typically associated with usability assessment environments. Several characteristics of user-testing, the heuristic evaluation, and the cognitive walkthrough were combined to create the User-CHAT. Prior research has demonstrated that the User-CHAT supports an evaluation within 3-4 hrs, can be used by individuals with limited human factors / usability background, and requires little training to be used competently, even for complex systems. A state-of-the-art suite of avionics displays and a series of benchmark tasks provided the context where the User-CHAT’s performance was measured relative to its parent usability methods. Two techniques generated comparison lists of usability problems – user-testing data and various inclusion criteria for usability problems identified by the User-CHAT, heuristic evaluation, and cognitive walkthrough. Overall the results demonstrated that the User-CHAT attained higher effectiveness scores than the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough, suggesting that it helped evaluators identify many usability problems that actually impact users, i.e., higher thoroughness, while attenuating time and effort on issues that were not important, i.e., higher validity. Furthermore, the User-CHAT had the greatest proportion of usability problems that were rated as serious, i.e., usability issues that hinder performance and compromise safety. The User-CHAT’s performance suggests that it is an appropriate usability technique to implement into the product development lifecycle. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Septoria tritici blotch caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), is an important disease of wheat worldwide capable of reducing yields by as much as 30 to 40%. In Kansas, the disease is widespread and losses in individual fields can exceed 25%. This study examined the genetic structure of Kansas populations of M. graminicola at different spatial scales (micro-plot, macro-plot, and statewide) using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Three primer pairs were used to resolve 174 polymorphic loci from 476 isolates. The results indicated high levels of genotypic variability, which is consistent with a genetically diverse initial inoculum. Genetic identities among populations representing the three spatial scales were >98%. Tests for differentiation among populations due to population subdivision revealed that on average 97.5% of the genetic variability occurred within populations with a correspondingly high migration rate of 16 to 23 individuals per generation. We observed little evidence of linkage disequilibrium, on average, only 4.6% of locus pairs were in disequilibrium. Our results indicate that Kansas populations of M. graminicola are characterized by regular recombination, are genetically diverse, and appear to be homogenous across different spatial scales. These populations are probably components of a larger pathogen pool that is distributed at least across much of Kansas and probably the central Great Plains. Because of the frequent recombination, the risk of adaptation of Kansas populations of M. graminicola to fungicide treatments or resistance genes is high and could be dispersed very quickly, whether these new pathogenic traits occur locally through mutation or by migration from other areas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Technological changes have always been subject to numerous debates and studies to establish if and how much they benefit society. Glyphosate resistant soybean can be seen as such a technological improvement that has generated numerous studies attempting to measure the welfare gains. There are obvious gains from adopting the technology from a production efficiency standpoint, as it significantly decreases production cost and simplifies weed control management. However, with some consumers being reluctant to embrace such a change, especially in Europe, it is not obvious that overall welfare gains are positive. This study attempts to address some shortcomings perceived in recent economic literature, namely the disregard of consumers’ demand responses and the lack of analysis over time.&#xd;
A partial equilibrium model is created where supply and demand functions are estimated based on observed prices and quantities, the adoption rate of the new technology, and production information such as yield and harvested areas. The model developed considers 6 different regions, namely the U.S., Europe, China, Argentina, Brazil and the rest of the world, and develops for each one of them a supply function and three demand functions for soybean grain, meal and oil. Once those are calibrated, the gains for the different players in the industry are computed.&#xd;
The findings are that the gains are proportionally allocated to the different consumers based on the share of the demand for the specific country. Price supports in the U.S. in the early years provide, proportionally to the adoption rate, more gains to the consumers. Producers gain or lose from the technology depending on whether they have adopted it or not. Countries like the U.S. or Argentina, who were the earlier adopters, definitely see an increase in their producer surplus from the adoption of the technology. Countries such as Brazil, which have delayed adopting the technology for political reasons, have faced a significant loss due to lower prices without the benefits of enjoying a cost-saving production technology. The innovator’s gain increases over time as the adoption rate rises. &#xd;
From a country perspective, the U.S. is without doubt the country that has benefited the most from the technology. The main reasons are that the U.S. has the largest acreage of soybean that is grown using the Glyphosate resistant technology. The U.S. consumer base for soybean products is the largest and the monopoly is a U.S.-based company. Therefore some of the gain captured abroad by the monopoly funnels into the U.S. &#xd;
This study finds that, from 2002 to 2005, even if the European consumer completely stopped purchasing soybean, the U.S. as a whole would still benefit from the technology. For the earlier period 1998-2005, the study finds that if Europe had decreased its demand from 35% to 48%, there would have been a possibility for the U.S. as a whole to have been made worse off by the technology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Growing resistant cultivars is an economically effective method to control wheat disease Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum. Ninety-five wheat lines mainly from China and Japan were evaluated for resistance to initial infection (type I), spread of symptoms within a spike (type II), and deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation in infected grains (type III). Most of lines were resistant or moderately resistant, 15 lines had DON content lower than 2 ppm and six lines showed a high level of resistance for all the three types. Deoxynivalenol content was significantly correlated with type II, but not type I resistance.&#xd;
Fifty-nine of the ninety-five lines were evaluated for genetic diversity on the basis of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Genetic relationships among these lines were consistent with pedigrees and their geographic distribution. Chinese lines had broader genetic diversity than Japanese lines. Sumai 3 is a widely used Chinese variety for FHB-resistant breeding in the US and elsewhere. Haplotype patterns of the SSR markers linked to FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 3BS, 5AS and 6BS of Sumai 3 indicated that only a few Sumai 3 derivatives carry all of these Sumai 3 QTL. SSR data also suggested that these QTL in Sumai 3 were derived from Chinese landrace Taiwan Xiaomai. Some highly resistant lines may carry novel QTL for FHB-resistance QTL, and need further investigation. &#xd;
A mapping population of 139 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross of Wangshuibai (resistant Chinese landrace)/Wheaton (susceptible cultivar) was genotyped with more than 1300 SSR and AFLP markers. Five QTL for type I resistance were detected on chromosome arms 3BS, 4BS, 5DL, 3AS, and 5AS; seven QTL for type II resistance on 3BS, 1AL, 5AS, 5DL, 7AL, and 3DL; and seven QTL for type III resistance on 3BS, 5AS, 1AS, 5DL, 1BL, and 7AL. These QTL together explained 31.7%, 64%, and 52.8% of the phenotypic variation for FHB type I, II, and III resistance, respectively. QTL on 5AS, the distal end of 3BS, and 5DL contributed to all three types of resistance. FHB resistance QTL identified in Wangshuibai can be used in developing wheat cultivars with enhanced FHB resistance by pyramiding FHB resistance QTL from other sources.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation examines the influence of the treaty system inaugurated at the Washington Naval Conference of 1921-22 upon innovation in the design of the interwar U.S. fleet.  The way in which sea power was viewed by the U.S. Navy of the period combined with the Navy’s unique organizational structure to shape the Navy’s efforts in building a “treaty fleet.”  In particular, the General Board of the Navy, a formal body established by the Secretary of the Navy to advise him on both strategic and other matters with respect to fleet, served as the organizational nexus for the interaction between fleet design and treaty implementation.  The General Board members orchestrated the efforts by the principal Naval Bureaus, the Naval War College, and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in ensuring that the designs adopted for the warships built and modified during the period of the Washington (Five Power) and London Naval Treaties both met treaty requirements while meeting strategic needs.  The leadership of the Navy at large, and the General Board in particular, felt themselves especially constrained by Article XIX (the fortification clause) of the Five Power Treaty that implemented a status quo on naval fortification in the Western Pacific.  The treaty system led the Navy to design a measurably different fleet than it might otherwise have done in the absence of naval limitations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This naturalistic case study was designed to provide descriptive data to examine the possible role of student learning styles in their collaborative participatory behaviors in an online text-based learning environment; and whether the technology-rich environment that promotes collaborative, project-based learning can have an effect on learners’ participation behavior from the point of view of learning styles. In this study, graduate and advanced undergraduate students’ discussion posts, project reports, reflections, and archived chat records were carefully analyzed. The research results indicated that, in an online collaborative learning environment participants were observed to use the Convergent, Divergent and Accommodating learning styles more often than Assimilating learning styles. Indeed, participants with the Assimilating learning style did not show a positive attitude towards online collaboration. Moreover, students who took a leadership role had their learning style kite shape close to the Concrete Experience learning mode; others who were more supportive had their kite shape close to the Reflective Observation “watching”; and those usually took both a leadership role and a supportive role and were comfortable with a variety of learning modes had their kite shape balanced along two or more dimensions of the learning cycles. The discussion of identified themes in this study is related to Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory framework. The study provides extended implications and suggestions for future research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Three studies, using descriptive sensory analysis with highly trained panelists, were conducted to better understand the sensory characteristics of fresh and processed tomatoes.&#xd;
A “green” note often has been described as part of tomato flavor and is noted in many fruits, vegetables, grains and processed products. Thus, the first study developed a sensory lexicon for green characteristics in foods. The lexicon, consisting of 17 sensory attributes, was&#xd;
used to characterize sensory properties of 22 chemicals potentially associated with green odor.&#xd;
Green characteristics can be differentiated as green-unripe, green-peapod, green-grassy/leafy,&#xd;
green-viney and green-fruity. Additional attributes that are important in various green&#xd;
characteristics included musty/earthy, pungent, bitter, sweet and floral. Various chemicals were&#xd;
described as green at different concentrations. Green-grassy/leafy was the most common characterizing green attribute of many of the chemicals studied. Changing the concentrations of&#xd;
the chemicals resulted not only in changing the intensity of the attributes, but it also altered the sensory profile of many of the chemicals.&#xd;
A sensory lexicon for describing tomatoes also was developed. A variety of fresh tomatoes, processed tomatoes, and tomato-based products such as ketchup and pasta sauce were used to create the lexicon. The characteristics of tomatoes can be described using 33 aroma,&#xd;
flavor and texture attributes. Some characteristics were common across all or most fresh and processed tomatoes. However, reducing the number of attributes may be possible for certain studies because some attributes were appropriate only for fresh or processed tomatoes, not both.&#xd;
A third study determined the sensory characteristics of five tomato types, including&#xd;
newer and older cultivars that varied in their physical traits and primary use. The impacts of&#xd;
processing on the sensory quality of tomato products were investigated, with juice (minimal&#xd;
processing) and paste (higher level of processing) being made from the cultivars. Fresh tomatoes differed significantly because of cultivar and ripening stage differences. Fresh tomatoes differed considerably from processed tomatoes. A low processing level intensified some key aroma and flavor attributes, but differences in flavor attributed to cultivar became minimal after a higher degree of processing. Textural differences among cultivars after processing were more pronounced than flavor differences.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation has two complementary components: educational, in a survey of students in Weed Science and their perception of the Kansas State University Agronomy Learning farm, and research, regarding interactions between mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides.  The Learning Farm serves as a resource where undergraduate students at KSU can develop agronomic skills through hands-on field site experiences and investigations.  Students’ perceptions of experiential learning activities in the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills were studied as a result of the Learning Farm.  Activities included: undergraduate students in Weed Science (AGRON 330) developing a weed management recommendation, and Undergraduate Research Assistants (URAs) conducting weed science research projects at the Learning Farm.  Students stated that experiential learning activities increased their critical thinking skills, required effective time management, and presented concepts that could be used in other situations.  Pre- and post-project evaluation questionnaires showed that URAs had an increased interest in agronomy, weed science, and research following the completion of their project.  For the research project, field and greenhouse studies were conducted from 2003 to 2006 to evaluate the efficacy of various sulfonylurea herbicides when applied with mesotrione or mesotrione + atrazine.  Research demonstrated that the addition of mesotrione to sulfonylurea herbicides decreased efficacy of sulfonylurea herbicides on green foxtail, yellow foxtail, and shattercane.  The addition of atrazine to the tank mix, or increased mesotrione rates, resulted in additional decrease in sulfonylurea herbicide efficacy on shattercane and foxtail species.  Additional studies were performed to determine if absorption, translocation, or metabolism was the basis for the reduction in sulfonylurea herbicide efficacy when mixed with mesotrione or mesotrione + atrazine.  Results indicated that the cause of antagonistic interaction between mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides in green and yellow foxtail was reduced absorption and translocation of the sulfonylurea herbicides.  Producers who choose to apply mesotrione and sulfonylurea herbicides to corn should apply the herbicides sequentially to achieve maximum control of weedy grass species.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to identify where secondary public school principals are spending their time while at school by using the population of secondary school principals in Nevada as a study group. A secondary purpose was to identify any statistically significant differences between how Nevada secondary public school principals spend their time in relation to grade configuration: middle school vs. high school, the size of the building they serve, age of the principal, gender of the principal, years of administrative experience and annual yearly progress classification. &#xd;
All secondary principals in the state of Nevada were sent the Time Management for Secondary School Principals’ survey instrument with a (Likert-type) rating scale developed by the researcher. &#xd;
Two statistically significant differences emerged as a result of this study. One, principals of schools with student enrollments of 1,001 students or more rate themselves as spending more time on management items than do principals with student enrollments of 1,000 students or less. Two, females rate themselves as spending more time on instructional leadership items than do their male counterparts. Also, the need to focus on critical components of instructional leadership so that principals can adequately address the 43% of schools not making annual yearly progress in Nevada is discussed.&#xd;
The intent of this study was to identify areas where time was being wasted so that recommendations could be provided to help principals balance their time in a more efficient manner. Principals identified strategies that could prevent focusing all their efforts on managerial issues and allow time for instructional leadership activities. Also, the perception vs. reality and practice vs. theory topics are discussed in relation to time management and instructional leadership. The findings derived from this study are reported in chapter 4 and recommendations to principals regarding effective time management strategies based on responses of Nevada principals are reported in chapter 5.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The goal of this project was to define mechanisms responsible for Na+ transport in two hormonally-sensitive epithelium, the bovine mammary gland and porcine vas deferens. Glucocorticoid stimulation in these epithelia results in a significant increase in amiloride-sensitive ion transport, suggesting regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC. ENaC has typically been described as a heteromultimeric ion channel with at least three different types of subunits, the most common being , β, and γ. Glucocorticoid-induced regulation of these subunits at the transcriptional level appears to be very different in the porcine vas deferens as compared to the bovine mammary gland. &#xd;
The aims of the study in mammary epithelium were to elucidate the mechanisms by which apical electrolytes and cytokines compromise barrier function in mammary epithelium. The long term goal is to better understand and manage the interaction between ionic composition of milk and breakdown of the gland epithelium that occurs during mastitis. Our results suggest a causal link between changes in milk electrical conductivity and epithelial barrier breakdown that has not been appreciated previously. Results will provide benefits to dairy farmers by characterizing steps that might prevent the development of mastitis or hasten recovery.&#xd;
The aims of the study using porcine vas deferens epithelial cells include determining the time course, concentration- and structure-dependency for regulation of amiloride-sensitive ion flux by corticosteroids. Corticosteroids caused a concentration-dependent increase in amiloride-sensitive Isc with a rank order of potency of dexamethasone>prednisolone>cortisol. Hill analysis indicates steep concentration dependency. The corticosteroid-induced, amiloride-sensitive current is Na+ absorption as indicated by radiotracer flux measurements. Studies employing selective antagonists (spironolactone, mifepristone) define glucocorticoid receptor mediation. These results suggest that vas deferens epithelia are exquisitely sensitive to corticosteroid exposure. Observed changes in epithelial function in response to corticosteroid exposure would rapidly and chronically affect the luminal environment to which sperm are exposed. Thus, physiological and pharmacological corticosteroid exposure is expected to affect male fertility.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The directed-assembly of small molecular building-blocks into discrete supermolecules or extended networks through non-covalent intermolecular interactions is an on-going challenge in the field of crystal engineering.  This synthetic challenge may be overcome by identifying or establishing a hierarchy of intermolecular interactions which, in turn, may facilitate a modular supramolecular assembly process producing final products in high yields.   &#xd;
A family of three 3-pyridine/amino-pyrimidine supramolecular reactants (SR’s) was prepared and allowed to react with aromatic carboxylic acids producing nine 1:1 molecular co-crystals and four 1:1 ionic salts through heteromeric O-H···N/N-H···O or charge-assisted N–H+···O-/N–H···O- hydrogen bonds with the amino-pyrimidine binding site.  We introduced a Q-value, based on AM1 calculations, to show that the amino-pyrimidine moiety is a superior hydrogen-bond acceptor for an incoming carboxylic acid. The amino-pyrimidine/carboxylic acid synthon resulted 13/13 times (100 % yield) even in the presence of other potentially disruptive intermolecular interactions.  However, reacting a 4-pyridine/amino-pyrimidine SR and a carboxylic acid in a 1:2 ratio, resulted in structures containing both acid/amino-pyrimidine and acid/pyridine synthons.&#xd;
The same family of pyridine/amino-pyrimidine SR’s were allowed to react with halogentated benzoic acids in which the amino-pyrimidine/carboxylic acid synthon formed 7/7 times (100 % yield) and halogen bonds (N···I or N···Br) extended the SR/acid dimers into polymeric networks 4/7 times (57 %).  These results were rationalized through a hierarchial view of intermolecular interactions consisting of hydrogen and halogen bonds.  &#xd;
Four bifunctional 3-pyridine/amino-pyrimidine or amino-pyridine SR’s were reacted with neutral metal complexes producing thirteen crystal structures in which the pyridyl moiety coordinates to the metal center 13/13 times (100 % yield) and amino-pyrimidine···amino-pyrimidine hydrogen bonds link the neighboring metal-ligand complexes 10/13 times (77 % yield) into 1-D or 2-D extended architectures.  &#xd;
Finally, we synthesized and characterized a series of tetra-substituted hydrogen bond donor and acceptor functionalized, i.e. pyridyl, amino-pyridine, carboxylic acid, resorcinarene-based cavitands forming deep-walled cavitands through amino-pyridine···carboxylic acid heteromeric synthons and a heterodimeric molecular capsule through pyridyl···carboxylic acid hydrogen bonds.  The heterodimeric capsule is only one of three, of its type, characterized crystallographically.</dc:description>

<dc:description>John Deere Corporation sponsors 16 schools within the United States that are designed to educate students to become future agricultural equipment technicians.  At the time of this study, the schools’ enrollments were at a less-than desirable level, 80% capacity.   However, the company was receiving feedback that dealerships needed technicians.  The need to determine the disparity between the need for technicians and the level of enrollment led to the pursuit of this study.&#xd;
The researcher sampled 306 John Deere agricultural service managers across the continental United States to determine: (a) if the dealerships truly needed technicians, (b) the methods dealerships were using for locating technicians, and (c) the service managers’ perceptions of the John Deere (JD) Ag Tech program.  The study also analyzed the relationships between the service managers’ perceptions of the JD Ag Tech program and five independent variables: (a) number of technicians employed at John Deere dealerships, (b) number of stores dealer-organizations own, (c) distance between John Deere dealerships and the closest JD Ag Tech school, (d) number of JD Ag Tech students John Deere dealerships have sponsored, and (e) service managers’ age.&#xd;
The results of the study indicated that John Deere service managers did plan to hire technicians over the next 12 months as well as over the next three years.  However, it was also determined that 60% of the service managers were only somewhat knowledgeable or unfamiliar with the JD Ag Tech Program.  For the service managers that had experienced sponsoring JD Ag Tech students, those service managers were satisfied with the JD Ag Tech graduates.  &#xd;
The researcher’s recommendations focused upon two areas.  The first was to improve the marketing of the JD Ag Tech program to insure that all John Deere service managers become familiar with the program.  The second recommendation was to focus on improving the “student” component of the partnership, by recruiting the students earlier in their high school careers, and having the partners work together to target high caliber students.</dc:description>

<dc:description>2-Formylbenzoquinoline and a selection of novel chiral bis(pyridine-imine) and bis-amide ligands derived from (1R,2R)-cyclohexanediamine and (R)-[1,1’-binaphthalene]-2,2’-diamine have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized.  Subsequently, their coordination chemistry has been investigated.  Metallation with Zn(II), Ni(II) and Fe(II) has resulted in the formation of a series of helical complexes, some of which exhibit unusual coordination modes.  &#xd;
Bis(imine-pyridine) ligands were found to form dinuclear complexes upon reaction with ZnCl2.  In one case, the use of Zn(CF3SO3)2 resulted in the formation a single stranded monohelix, after the ligand had undergone a reduction at one imine bond.  The use of NiI2 as the metal salt resulted in the formation of penta-coordinate complexes with N3-coordination and helical dinuclear complexes with bridging iodo ligands.  Ni(CF3SO3)2 was also used, this resulted in the formation of a double stranded mononuclear complex.  The ligand, in this case was hydrolyzed to yield a tridentate ligand, subsequently two of these new ligands coordinate to one metal center to form the complex.  &#xd;
Bis-amide ligands were reacted with FeCl2 and Fe(CF3SO3)2  to form complexes with various different colors.  In all but one case, several attempts to structurally characterize the Fe(II) complexes were unsuccessful.  Suitable crystals of this complex revealed a double stranded helicate complex that coordinates through carbonyl oxygens rather than amide nitrogens.  The work described herein, is an account of the synthesis, characterization and study of a new family of tetradentate nitrogen donor ligands and their respective transition metal complexes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Finding qualified teachers is a growing concern to school districts nationwide. Special Education is one of those areas that is highly in need.&#xd;
Researchers have suggested the reason for these shortages is not recruitment of special education teachers, but the retention of special education teachers. The research has also shown that lack of effective building administrative support may&#xd;
be a critical factor in a teachers’ decision to stay or leave the field. This study was developed to determine what administrative behavior special education teachers value the most. Additionally, this study sought to find out if there were&#xd;
differences in the administrative behaviors that special education teachers value and what building administrators perceive to be of value.&#xd;
A survey was sent electronically to a random sample of convenience to 200 special education teachers and 200 building administrators in the state of Kansas; 276 surveys were returned. The survey collected data to determine the perceived value of administrative support behaviors by the special education teachers, and any differences of the perceived value of administrative supports by the building administrators. The survey items were categorized into four subgroups of administrative behaviors: emotional, environmental, technical, and instructional.&#xd;
The administrative behaviors of most value to the special education teachers were those that were emotional in nature. Respondents reported that the&#xd;
most valued support actions included providing praise and acknowledging that the teacher makes a difference, supporting the teacher in front of parents, and trusting the teacher’s judgment. Findings also indicated that there were statistically significant differences between what administrative supports special education&#xd;
teachers valued and what building administrators perceive to be of value to special education teachers, with the exception of the technical administrative support actions. These findings suggested that it would benefit school districts positively to implement strategies to evaluate the emotional support provided and desired by&#xd;
their special education teachers as one method to reduce special education teacher attrition. One way of ensuring administrators provide these supports is to hold them accountable, perhaps through policy change in the evaluation process. With recent legislation such as No Child Left Behind, mandating all students receive a quality education form qualified teachers despite the current shortage of special education teachers; administrators must implement strategies to reduce teacher attrition.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Teaching visual literacy in the secondary English/language arts classroom: an exploration of teachers’ attitudes, understanding and application</dc:title>

<dc:description>With changes in technology over the past decades, literacy now requires receiving and transmitting information using various, multiple media. Recognizing the need for students to be literate in more the traditional areas of reading and writing, professional organizations and states have set standards for English/language arts related to non-print literacy, including visual literacy. Yet, it has been unclear how secondary English/language arts teachers feel about the mandate to teach non-print literacy, if they understand what is expected of them in teaching non-print literacy, and if they indeed are teaching concepts related to comprehension and production of information in non-text format. This study attempts to discover teachers’ attitudes toward, understanding of, and use of visual literacy concepts through a survey of secondary English/language arts teachers in three counties in central Kansas. &#xd;
Based on the information from the responses to the survey, secondary English/language arts teachers in central Kansas have received little formal training in teaching visual literacy and that their informal training consists mainly of discussions with colleagues and independent study. Because they have received little training, most respondents see teaching visual literacy as secondary to teaching traditional literacy rather than as an integral part of such instruction. The state of Kansas has several standards relating to teaching non-print text. Yet, the emphasis on state and national tests is on print text. As a result, secondary English/language teachers surveyed know little about what it means to teach visual literacy. Training in how to incorporate visual literacy instruction with traditional literacy instruction, how to set outcomes for visual literacy and how to assess those outcomes are necessary if standards related to non-print text are to be addressed in secondary English/language arts classes across the state. While English/language arts pursue training in visual literacy on their own, teachers-preparatory institutions and public school systems also have a responsibility to see that English/language arts teachers know how to help their students become literate, not only in traditional literacies but also in non-traditional literacies such as visual literacy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Advocacy is an increasingly integral role for school counselors, and advocacy dispositions, knowledge, and skill competencies are critical for school counselors to function effectively in the contemporary school setting. This study assessed the perceptions of school counselor educators regarding the degree of importance of including advocacy dispositions, knowledge, and skill competencies (Trusty &amp; Brown, 2005) in master’s degree school counseling programs; the extent to which the advocacy competencies are taught in the program; and the relative readiness of program graduates to apply the advocacy competencies. Additionally, this study also investigated whether there were significant differences between the responses of participants associated with CACREP-accredited and those with non-CACREP-accredited school counselor preparation programs. &#xd;
Stratified proportional sampling was used to identify study participants. A sample of 250 counselor educators teaching in master’s degree programs in school counseling was identified and a survey was sent to each participant. One-hundred thirty six surveys were returned (54.4%); this represented 69 CACREP-accredited programs and 67 non-CACREP-accredited programs involving respondents in each region of Association for Counselor Education and Supervision. Mean ratings for respondents indicated that counselor educators perceived inclusion of the 15 advocacy competencies in master’s programs in school counseling as moderately to very important, moderately taught in their programs, and their graduates to be moderately ready to apply the advocacy competencies. Using independent samples t-tests to compare the mean ratings, the results showed no statistically significant differences between CACREP-accredited and non-CACREP-accredited respondents.&#xd;
It was concluded that the advocacy disposition, knowledge, and skill competencies delineated by Trusty and Brown (2005) are appropriate for inclusion in master’s degree programs in school counseling, and that additional focus on advocacy competencies might be needed within programs to ensure that all school counseling graduates learn and are able to apply the competencies. It was also concluded that the perceptions of counselor educators in CACREP-accredited and non-CACREP-accredited programs are more similar than different relative to the importance of including the competencies in graduate programs, the extent to which they are taught, and the readiness of graduates to apply the competencies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Polyoxometalates have attracted much attention over the last few decades and have been studied in a wide variety of fields such as catalysis, medicine, imaging, photochromism, and magnetic materials. While many of these systems are easy to prepare, the ability to functionalize polyoxometalates is an ongoing challenge.&#xd;
Two approaches used to functionalize polyoxometalates involve insertion of metal&#xd;
fragments into a lacunary polyoxometalate or the direct replacement of terminal oxo ligands with the isoelectronic organoimido ligand. This process has been proven successful in many cases and with a wide variety of organoimido compounds. One of our group’s goals has been to synthesize a functionalized hexamolybdate species that is capable of metal coordination.  However, previous results have been hindered because the electron withdrawing effect of the cluster is transmitted to the metal binding sites.&#xd;
In order to combat the electron withdrawing effect of the cluster, 4-amino piperidine dithiocarbamate ligands, which have no conjugation in the ring and are capable of metal binding, have been synthesized and characterized. A series of transition metal complexes have been made and a single crystal has been grown of a nickel(II) complex. Attempts to attach these species to clusters are described.&#xd;
Imido hexamolybdate clusters have been functionalized with styryl and iodophenyl&#xd;
groups. The styrene functionalized hexamolybdate was copolymerized with 4- chloromethylstyrene in moderate yields. This copolymer has the capabilities for further substitution at the chloromethyl group. The iodophenyl functionalized hexamolybdate was fully characterized including a single-crystal X-ray structural determination. This functionalized hexamolybdate can be used in carbon-carbon bond formation through coupling reactions.&#xd;
A chromium(V) nitrido polyoxometalate has been synthesized from a lacunary Keggin precursor and characterized. This nitrido species shows promise as a nitrogen transfer agent.  Likewise, this nitrido species could be an entry point to other derivatives through reactions with various nucleophiles and electrophiles.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine selected financial implications of various mandates in the No Child Left Behind Act (P.L. #107-110 popularly known as NCLB) of 2001 on Kansas public school districts. Specific mandates included accountability for student achievement, more educational choices for parents, teaching methods that produce results, emphasis on reading, emphasis on math, hiring highly qualified teachers, and teaching English to all students. Expenditures for these mandates were identified and analyzed to estimate which mandates were perceived as having the greatest financial impact on Kansas school districts’ budgets during FY 2006—the fiscal year of record for this study.&#xd;
	A survey research design was utilized for this study. The survey instrument sought opinions about expenditure items categorized according to the selected mandates. A seven-point one-directional intensity scale was used to determine school superintendents’ attitudes toward the financial impact of selected mandates on their school districts’ budget. Data were analyzed and reported using measures of central tendency, range, inter-quartile analysis, and standard deviation. Narrative responses from respondents were also presented.&#xd;
	Analysis of data revealed that many Kansas public schools are presently experiencing economic and political conditions that could interfere with the state’s ability to provide a quality education for all students under NCLB. Such conditions often include:  (1) decreasing student enrollment, resulting in consolidation of some school districts; (2) difficulty hiring and retaining highly qualified teachers and administrators: (3) increasing numbers of superintendents with less experience in a position that has become more demanding and complex; (4) increased need to use existing funds to improve the academic performance of economically disadvantaged and special education students; and (5) having to rely on the singular standard of annual assessment of student performance in math and reading to determine accreditation success or failure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study made use of a three round Delphi survey process to explore the influential factors in the personal clinical theory development of marriage and family therapists. The sample consisted of marriage and family therapy trainees in COAMFTE accredited masters programs around the country. The initial round began with 64 items and resulted in 94 items. The last round resulted in 94 items being rated as to their amount of influence upon the personal clinical theory development of the trainees. A core set of variables were identified that were seen to be highly influential in the theory development process. Panelists were able to reach a strong consensus on all but one of these variables. A much larger set of variables were deemed moderately high in importance and varied in&#xd;
the overall degree of consensus that was obtained among all panelists. The results of this study, in terms of personal clinical theory development, point to the power of the personal relationships formed in the training process. Multiple variables related to the power of personal relationships with MFT program supervisors/professors. Key graduate and undergraduate courses were identified as being highly influential. Recommendations for future study, and program emphasis are offered.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Marriage and family therapists (MFTs) over the past twenty years have increased their visibility by using their clinical skills and a systemic framework in other areas outside of therapy (i.e., business, school, medicine). Many of these individuals have pioneered roads of systems theory application through a creative process. Traditional creativity research has focused mainly on individual factors. However, Csikszentmihalyi’s theories of flow and creativity have offered important insight on the systemic nature of the creative process. Recently, research regarding intrinsic motivation and group creativity has provided more insight on how Csikszentmihalyi’s theory could be further developed. Furthermore, applying an ecological systems theory framework to his current model provides additional levels of influence to be examined in regards to maximizing creative potential in individuals and groups. Using deductive and inductive methodologies, an ecological systems theory of creativity is presented providing a framework for studying how MFTs that have successfully entered into non-traditional realms of systemic application go through the creative process of entering into their endeavors. Interviews with successful MFTs applying skills in non-traditional areas of applications were conducted using a modified phenomenological approach. Creative processes were outlined based on themes and patterns that emerged during the analysis. Implications of these findings are made regarding how to improve creativity in MFTs at the individual, academic, and professional field levels. In addition, implications are made regarding how to improve student recruitment and maximize potential in MFT trainees. Finally, implications regarding the maximization of productivity in university settings and applying systemic creativity to business, school, government, and education settings are presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purposes of this study were to explore factors associated with residents’ dining experience in assisted living facilities and to investigate the influence that these factors had on perceived quality and residents’ satisfaction with their dining experience.  Food quality, service quality, mealtime customization, and dining room environment were the four constructs explored.  Focus groups were conducted with residents of three assisted living facilities to determine attributes of the constructs that were important to them.  A total of 22 residents participated in the three focus groups.  A questionnaire developed by Huang was revised to include measurement items identified in the focus groups.  The questionnaire was distributed to residents of 16 randomly selected assisted living facilities within a 110 mile radius of the research institution.  Of the 492 residents in 16 facilities, 246 completed the questionnaire for a response rate of 50%.  Residents evaluated the attributes on a 5-point likert scale (1-strongly disagree; 5-strongly agree).  Service quality (4.03) and dining room environment (3.97) attributes were rated significantly higher than food quality (3.64) and customization attributes (3.42).  Resident satisfaction also was evaluated on a 5-point scale (1-very dissatisfied; 5-very satisfied).  Residents were satisfied with the overall dining experience (3.94) and the overall facility (3.97).  Residents were less satisfied with food served (3.67) or the amount of choices they had at meals (3.58).  Residents were satisfied with services (3.95) and the dining room atmosphere (3.98).  Satisfaction with services and the dining room atmosphere were significantly higher than food served and amount of choices at mealtimes. Residents’ perceptions of food quality, service quality, level of customization, and dining room environment had a positive influence on their satisfaction with the overall dining experience.  Residents’ perceptions of food quality had a positive influence on satisfaction with the food served, service quality impacted satisfaction with services, level of customization effected satisfaction with the amount of choices, and dining room environment influenced satisfaction with the dining room atmosphere.  Administrators, foodservice directors, and dietitians employed in assisted living facilities can use the results to improve the dining experience for residents and ultimately improve residents’ quality of life.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research was conducted to investigate the potential of charged-water spray in controlling dust in livestock buildings.  Specific objectives were to: (1) develop a method to measure the electrostatic charge of airborne particles; (2) characterize the size distribution and charge of airborne particles in a livestock building; (3) evaluate the effectiveness of charged-water spray in controlling dust concentration in enclosed spaces under laboratory conditions; (4) model the effectiveness of charged-water spray in controlling dust in an enclosed building; and (5) develop and evaluate an electrostatically-assisted particulate wet scrubber (EAPWS).&#xd;
A dynamic Faraday-cage sampler was developed for measuring the net charge-to-mass ratio of particles.  The device involves collecting particles on a filter and measuring the charge induced.  The sampler was calibrated and then used to measure the charge of dispersed particles (i.e., corn starch, NaHCO3, positively charged water spray, negatively charged water spray, and uncharged water spray).  The corresponding net charge-to-mass ratios were -0.11 (SD=0.07), +0.20 (0.001), +7.24 (1.6), -6.47 (0.9), and -0.30 (0.12) mC/kg. &#xd;
Characterization of dust in a swine building showed mean dust concentration of 0.89 (SD=0.45) mg/m3, geometric mean diameter of particles of 9.34 μm, and geometric standard deviation of 2.11.  The Faraday-cage sampler was also used in the swine building; the net charge-to-mass ratio of particles was +0.68 mC/kg (SD=0.31 mC/kg).&#xd;
The effectiveness of charged-water spray in reducing dust concentration was investigated in an experimental chamber.  Test particles (i.e., corn starch, NaHCO3) were dispersed into the chamber and then charged water was sprayed into the chamber.  The charged-water spray was significantly more effective than either the uncharged-water spray or no water spray.  The removal efficiency of the charged water spray (4 min spray duration, 120 mL/min), based on mass, ranged from 88% to 92% for particles ≤ 10 µm equivalent aerodynamic diameter (EAD) and from 34% to 70% for particles ≤ 2.5 µm EAD.   A model based on coagulation was used to predict the particle concentration after spraying of charged water.  Predicted values of concentration and removal efficiency agreed well with measured values.&#xd;
A prototype EAPWS was also developed.  Laboratory and field evaluations of the EAPWS indicated that it had significantly higher particle removal efficiency than either the control (i.e., no water spray) or the uncharged wet scrubber.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the study was to research, develop, and validate a step-by-step guide for museum and public school partnerships that wish to create motivational standards-based curriculum materials in high school social studies.   &#xd;
	Museum and Public School Partnerships: A Step-by-Step Guide for Creating Motivational Standards-Based Curriculum Materials in High School Social Studies was developed using the research and development methodology of Borg and Gall (1989).  The research and development process used in this study included seven steps:  1) research analysis and proof of concept, 2) product planning and design, 3) preliminary product development, 4) preliminary field testing, 5) revision of the prototype, 6) main field testing, and 7) revision of the final product.  A prototype of the guide was produced and then evaluated by museum and public school experts in the preliminary field test.  Revisions were made to the guide based on their feedback.  The guide was then distributed to practitioners in the main field test.  The reviewers in the main field test were museum staff or high school history educators; or museum, curriculum, or technology directors in the United States.  Feedback from the main field test was used to create the final product.  &#xd;
	Major conclusions of the study were: a) there was a lack of literature specifically for museum and public school partnerships that wished to create motivational standards-based curriculum materials for high school social studies, b) museum and public school personnel benefit from quality resource step-by-step guides, c) educational guides developed through research and development methodology offer museum and public school personnel practical and valuable products for improving education, d) a step-by-step guide is a useful tool when museums and public schools partner to create motivational standards-based curriculum materials for high school social studies, e) this study produced the first step-by-step guide for museums and public schools that wish to partner to create motivational standards-based curriculum materials for high school social studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study poses questions about the nature of tutoring processes in college level writing centers.  As tutors engage student writers, they are presented with complex rhetorical and interpersonal decisions.  This researcher seeks to understand deliberate strategies and thought processes applied by tutors to encourage critical thinking abilities in students.  How do writing center tutors decide which strategies are needed for different tutoring situations?  How do they perceive the reasons why they themselves apply particular strategies?  In order to explore these and other questions, the researcher observes tutorial sessions conducted by ten college-level writing center tutors.  Triangulated research methodologies are applied, including observation/video-taping, audio-taped think-aloud protocols, transcribed text analysis, a group exit interview, and external collaborator analysis. Immediately following each video-taped tutorial session, the researcher views the video-tape with each respective tutor.  Following instruction in think-aloud protocol process, tutors are asked to reflect orally on the process and decision-making strategies applied throughout the tutorial session.  Each of these think-aloud sessions is audio-taped.  All ten of the video-taped and audio-taped tutorial sessions are then transcribed and coded for thematic patterns.  Two credible outside co-raters are asked to analyze the texts, as well, providing interater reliability.  Conclusions and implications about how writing center peer tutor perceive individual strategies applied in tutorial sessions are considered.  How do tutors decide what types of questions and comments to ask?  How do they facilitate the process of fostering student learning and critical thinking?  What are the perceived barriers to success in each session?</dc:description>

<dc:description>Contingent valuation (CV), choice experiment (CE) and experimental auction (EA) or the combinations of the three methods are often used by researchers to elicit consumer willingness to pay for food attributes (food label).  The main concern about these approaches is that different quality attributes of food are assumed independent.  &#xd;
The problem of the independence assumption of a food attribute is that one attribute can signal information about another attribute or could be a proxy of overall product quality.  In addition, in surveys consumers tend to be forced to focus on the limited attribute information that are presented by researchers, whereas in the real world, consumers have various sources of food quality information.  The limited attributes provided in a survey may lead respondents to allocate their budgets to those limited attributes rather than allocate their budgets to a larger number of product attributes to truly reveal their preferences.&#xd;
The main objective of this study is to reveal the marginal impacts of additional food quality attributes on consumer WTP for food labels.&#xd;
Surveys containing a series of online CEs were collected to investigate the effects of additional beef steak attributes on consumer WTP in two different US markets.  Both surveys included the same four questionnaires.  Two questionnaires test the effect of additional attributes when no cue attributes are provided to the respondents, while the other two questionnaires test the effect of additional attributes when cue attributes are also presented.  Every questionnaire contains two CEs, with the second CE having one more attribute than the first. &#xd;
Random parameters logit models are estimated for each CE in the four questionnaires with survey results from both samples, resulting in 16 sets of estimations altogether.  The models with the different survey samples reveal consistent results regarding changes in WTP with more attributes added to the CEs.  Consumer WTP for the most important attributes in the CE decreases when the number of attributes increases from three to four, while the WTP for the most important attributes increases when the number of attribute increase from four to five.  The changes in the WTP for attributes depend on their relationships with the newly added attributes to the CEs and the number of attributes in CEs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Over the years sampling and experimental design have developed independently with little mutual compatibility.  However, many studies do (or should) involve both a sampling design and an experimental design.  For example, a polluted site may be exhaustively partitioned into area plots, a random sample of plots selected, and the selected plots randomly assigned to three clean-up regimens.  In this research the relationship between sampling design and experimental design is discussed and a basic review of each is given.  An estimator that combines sampling and experimental design is presented and it's development explained.  Properties of this estimator will be derived and some applications of the estimator will be examined.  Finally, a simulation study comparing this estimator with the traditional estimator will be presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Carbon adsorbents, namely, activated carbons and carbon molecular sieves, can be variously applied in the purification and separation of gaseous and liquid mixtures, e.g., in the separation of nitrogen or oxygen from air; often, carbon adsorbents also serve as catalysts or catalyst supports. The formation of carbon adsorbents entails the modification of the original internal surfaces of carbonaceous substrates by resorting to a variety of chemical or physical methods, thereby augmenting the carbonaceous substrates' adsorbing capacity. The formation of carbon adsorbents proceeds randomly, which is mainly attributable to the discrete nature, mesoscopic sizes, and irregular shapes of the substrates utilized as well as to their intricate internal surface configuration. Moreover, any process of carbon-adsorbent formation may fluctuate increasingly severely with time. It is desirable that such a process involving discrete and mesoscopic entities undergoing complex motion and behavior be explored by means of the statistical framework or a probabilistic paradigm. This work aims at probabilistic analysis, modeling, and simulation of the formation of carbon adsorbents on the basis of mechanistic rate expressions. Specifically, the current work has formulated a set of linear and non-linear models of varied complexity; derived the governing equations of the models formulated; obtained the analytical solutions of the governing equations whenever possible; simulated one of the models by the Monte Carlo method; and validated the results of solution and simulation in light of the available experimental data for carbon-adsorbent formation from carbonaceous substrates, e.g., biomass or coal, or simulated data obtained by sampling them from a probability distribution. It is expected that the results from this work will be useful in establishing manufacturing processes for carbon adsorbents. For instance, they can be adopted in planning bench-scale or pilot-scale experiments; preliminary design and economic analysis of production facilities; and devising the strategies for operating and controlling such facilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We investigated the effect of shear on the structure and aggregation kinetics of unstable colloids using small angle light scattering.  We used an aqueous suspension of 20 nm polystyrene latex microspheres and MgCl2 to induce aggregation.  The sample was only sheared once for approximately 33 seconds at different times, typically 1 min., 5 min., or 15 min., after the onset of aggregation.  The average shear rate was in the range of 0.13 - 3.56 s-1, which was in a laminar regime.  The unsheared sample gelled after ca. 45 min.  When the sample was sheared soon after the onset of aggregation, the aggregation followed DLCA kinetics to yield  = 1.80 ± 0.04 aggregates unaffected by the shear.  The gel time also remained the same as the unsheared gel.  Shearing at later stages of aggregation shortened the gel time and enhanced the scattered light intensity significantly indicating rapid growth.  Then, depending on the shear rate, there were three different behaviors.  At high shear rates, the aggregate structure was inhomogeneous after the shear was stopped with a crossover in slope in the scattered light intensity vs. q, to imply hybrid superaggregates with two different fractal dimensions.  At intermediate shear rates far from the gel point, there was a similar crossover after the shear was stopped; however, the fractal dimension regained 1.80 ± 0.04 at the gel point.  At low shear rates, the aggregation rate was increased, but the aggregate structure was uniform, and the fractal dimension remained 1.75 ± 0.05.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study examined end-of-the-year seventh grade students’ rational number knowledge using comparison tasks and rational number subconstruct tasks. Comparison tasks included: comparing two decimals, comparing two fractions and comparing a fraction and a decimal. The subconstructs of rational number addressed in this research include: part-whole, measure, quotient, operator, and ratio. Between eighty-six and one-hundred-one students were assessed using a written instrument divided into three sections. Nine students were interviewed following the written instrument to probe for further understanding.  Students were classified by error patterns using decimal comparison tasks. Students were initially to be classified into four groups according to the error pattern: whole number rule (WNR), zero rule (ZR), fraction rule (FR) or apparent expert (AE). However, two new patterns emerged: ignore zero rule (IZR) and money rule (MR).  Students’ knowledge of the subconstructs of rational numbers was analyzed for the students as a whole, but also analyzed by classification to look for patterns within small groups of students and by individual students to create a thick, rich description of what students know about rational numbers. Students classified as WNR struggled across almost all of the tasks. ZR students performed in many ways similar to WNR but in other ways performed better. FR and MR students had more success across all tasks compared to WNR and ZR. On average apparent experts performed significantly better than those students classified by errors. However, further analysis revealed hidden misconceptions and deficiencies for a number of apparent experts. Results point to the need to make teachers more aware of the misconceptions and deficiencies because in many ways errors reflect the school experiences of students.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Graphing calculators have been used in education since 1986, but there is no consensus as to how, or if, they should be used. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National Research Council promote their use, and ample research supports the positive benefits of their use, but not all teachers share this view. Also, rural schools face obstacles that may hinder them from implementing technology. The purpose of this study is to determine how graphing calculators are used in mathematics instruction of high schools in western Kansas, a rural region of the state. In addition to exploring the introduction level of graphing calculators, the frequency of their use, and classes in which they are used, this study also investigated the beliefs of high school mathematics teachers as related to teaching mathematics and the use of graphing calculators. Data were collected through surveys, interviews, and observations of classroom teaching. Results indicate that graphing calculators are allowed or required in almost all of the high schools of this region, and almost all teachers have had some experience using them in their classrooms. Student access to graphing calculators depends more on the level of mathematics taken in high school than on the high school attended; graphing calculator calculators are allowed or required more often in higher-level classes than in lower-level classes. Teachers believe that graphing calculators enhance student learning because of the visual representation that the calculators provide, but their teaching styles have not changed much because of graphing calculators. Teachers use graphing calculators as an extension of their existing teaching style. In addition, nearly all of the teachers who were observed and classified as non-rule-based based on their survey utilized primarily rule-based teaching methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It is still a dream to image the dynamics of electrons in atoms and molecules experimentally. This is due to the fact that such motion takes place in an ultra-short time scale; for example, an electron moves around the Bohr orbit in about 150-as (1 as = 10 -18 s), and pulses much shorter than this limit are not currently available to probe such fast dynamics. In recent years, an isolated single attosecond pulse has been produced by extracting the cutoff of harmonic spectrum driven by a laser pulse as short as ~ 5fs (1fs =10-15 s). But, these pulses are still too long in order to make the dream come true. Here, we study the possibility of generation of a much shorter and wavelength tunable single attosecond pulse by using polarization gating. &#xd;
In the experiment, we compressed ~30fs pulses from the laser amplifier down to ~6fs and characterized them. These linearly polarized pulses were converted to ellipticity varying pulses, and by exploiting the property of the strong dependence of the harmonic signal with the ellipticity of the laser, an XUV supercontinuum was produced in the harmonic spectrum which could support 60-as pulses. The bandwidth of such a supercontinuum, and therefore the duration of the attosecond pulses, is limited mainly by the currently available energy of the driving laser pulses at few cycle limits. In this project, we present an approach which allowed us to scale up the energy of such pulses by a factor of 1.5 in “Hollow Core Fiber / Chirped Mirrors Compressor”. &#xd;
Finally, in order to temporarily characterize the attosecond pulses we designed and built an “Attosecond Streak Camera”. Most of such cameras to date are limited to measuring a 1 dimensional energy spectrum and have only a few degrees of acceptance angle. Our camera is capable of measuring 2d momentum of the photoelectrons with large acceptance angle, for example ~ 65o at the photoelectron of energy ~15 eV. Recently, we observed the sidebands in addition to the main peaks in their laser assisted XUV photoelectron spectrum. The single attosecond pulses, after being characterized with this high speed camera, can be used to explore the dynamics of electrons at the attosecond scale.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to create a handbook for school and museum educators to support their development of curriculum materials that provide meaningful access to diverse learners.  The handbook was developed using the research and development methodology (R&amp;D) developed by Borg and Gall (1989).  The steps in the R&amp;D cycle used in this study included:  &#xd;
(1) Research analysis and proof of concept; a proof of concept consisted of interviews with three national experts in the areas of accessibility, education, and museum education to determine the need for the resource.&#xd;
(2) Product planning and design; information was gathered through a literature review, curriculum materials derived from a collaborative partnership between Kansas State University and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum were used as examples.&#xd;
(3) Product development; a prototype of the handbook was created. &#xd;
(4) Preliminary field test; the handbook was evaluated by five national leaders in the fields of education, accessibility, and museum education. &#xd;
(5) Product revision; revisions were made based on feedback from the preliminary field test.&#xd;
(6) Main field test; seven potential users from the areas of education and museum education reviewed the handbook.&#xd;
(7) Operational product revision; feedback from the main field test was used for final revisions.&#xd;
Conclusions: &#xd;
1.  There was a need for a resource to assist professionals in the design of curriculum materials that were accessible to diverse learners in both the school and museum setting.&#xd;
2.  The handbook was useful to both intended audiences.  Museum educators found the handbook expanded their thinking to include cognitive accessibility.  School educators reported the handbook increased their skills in designing learning activities for diverse learners.&#xd;
3.  The handbook provided specific instructions in the applications of differentiated instruction and universal design to curriculum developed for museums.&#xd;
4.  Physical accessibility was accepted as an important concern for museum educators.  This awareness provided a useful bridge to cognitive accessibility.&#xd;
5.  Cognitive accessibility was accepted as an important concern for school educators. The handbook increased their skills in reaching diverse learners.&#xd;
6.  Both museum and school educators appreciated the technology resources that prompted reviewers’ expanded thinking.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explored the effects of personal epistemological beliefs about mathematics and beliefs about the ability to do well in mathematics on achievement in a college-level, developmental mathematics class. The influences of gender, age, and ethnicity on these beliefs as they relate to mathematics achievement were also explored. The Mathematics Belief Scales (MBS) was adapted from the Indiana Mathematics Belief&#xd;
Scales and Self-Description Questionnaire III to measure beliefs about the time it takes to&#xd;
solve mathematics problems, the importance of conceptual understanding in mathematics, the procedural emphasis in mathematics, the usefulness of mathematics, and self-concept about mathematics. MBS was administered to 159 participants enrolled in Intermediate Algebra over two semesters at an urban, state-supported mid-western university and two small private mid-western universities. Responses to the surveys and&#xd;
scores on the final exams for the Intermediate Algebra courses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Pearson product-moment correlations, analysis of variance techniques, and hierarchical regression analysis.&#xd;
Results indicated that students generally held nonavailing beliefs about mathematics and mathematics self-concept. Students typically believed that mathematical problems should be solved within ten minutes. Students generally did not believe that math problems can be solved with logic and reason instead of learned math rules. Over 40% of the students did not believe that mathematics beyond basic mathematics was&#xd;
useful to everyday life. Students were also generally not confident in their ability to solve&#xd;
mathematics problems.&#xd;
Additionally, men’s self-concept was significantly higher than women’s self-concept.&#xd;
Adult learners’ self-concept was also significantly higher than traditional age&#xd;
students’ self-concept. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the importance of&#xd;
understanding mathematical concepts positively influenced final exam scores for men more so than women and self-concept positively influenced final exam scores for women more so than men. These results indicate a need for academic experiences at the college-level that will challenge students’ current belief system and provide an environment that is supportive and conducive to building individual self-confidence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Upland soils in east central Kansas have a complex genesis, often contain one or more paleosols, and form in multiple parent materials including loess, colluvium, residuum, and alluvium. Quaternary loess/paleosol investigations have largely ignored this region of Kansas, as the total loess thickness on uplands is &lt;2 m thick. In this study, the objectives are to examine the morphology and genesis of the soils of interest and how these characteristics vary within soil profiles, across landscapes, and throughout the current series mapping extent. The series of interest include the Irwin, Konza, Dwight, and Ladysmith soil series. Methods used in this study include field&#xd;
descriptions and sampling, terrain analysis, micromorphological investigations, and laboratory characterization, including silt and clay mineralogy. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was used for numerical dating and determination of stable carbon isotope values (δ13C) for selected paleosols. Radiocarbon ages ranged from 24,000 to 19,000 yr BP and δ13C values were between -19 and -17 ‰ (PDB), indicating that the&#xd;
paleosols were formed in Gilman Canyon loess or the Severance formation, under a mix of C3 and C4 vegetation. Terrain analysis results illustrated that, in given drainage areas, the soil series were mapped on a wide range of slope positions. Field observations and terrain analysis confirmed no relationships between mollic epipedon&#xd;
thickness, solum thickness, paleosol thickness, or depth to the paleosol with respect to&#xd;
landform. Micromorphological investigations revealed increasing soil development with&#xd;
depth, i.e., the presence of two paleosols beneath the modern soil. Mean particle size&#xd;
and mineralogy vary geographically within individual series. Pedogenic carbonate&#xd;
accumulations and redoximorphic concentrations are common features of the soils of interest, and less common features include sodium and gypsum accumulations, slickensides, and redoximorphic depletions. Results from this study will be provided to the USDA-NRCS for use in future soil survey updates, and will contribute to Quaternary&#xd;
loess/paleosol knowledge in Kansas and the Great Plains.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was designed to investigate teaching practices of mathematics teachers in rural high schools in Kansas in the context of the NCTM Principles and Standards.  National reports advocate for change in the mathematics classroom while state assessments force teachers to focus on test scores.  This study investigated the extent to which teachers whose students experienced repeated success on state assessments integrated the NCTM Process and Content Standards into the mathematics classroom.  Those data were then compared with the teaching practices in schools whose students repeatedly did poorly on state assessments. &#xd;
This two-phase study used both quantitative and qualitative data from four main sources: survey, interview, observation, and collection of artifacts.  Phase I surveyed all mathematics teachers in high performing  and low performing rural high schools throughout the state of Kansas.  Data collected in Phase I were used to examine differences and similarities in teaching practices of teachers from high and low performing schools.  During Phase II qualitative data were collected and analyzed to further explore any existing patterns among high performing and low performing schools.  Results from teachers in high and low performing schools were compared and contrasted to determine if there were differences between the teaching practices that were demonstrated by each group of teachers.&#xd;
Results of surveys, interviews, observations, and artifacts revealed teachers in high performing schools used a variety of different representations to teach and assess a topic while those teachers from low performing schools used one or two representations.  Students from high performing schools had more frequent opportunities to communicate with the teacher to gain additional assistance in learning the mathematics content.  Teachers in high performing schools also used formal assessment strategies as part of the learning process more consistently than their counterparts from low performing schools.  Results from interviews, observations, and artifacts reveal that teachers in high and low performing schools implement teaching practices aligned with the algebra content standards in a very similar manner.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Tariff rate quotas (TRQs) are one of the most widely used trade policy instruments in agricultural trade. The issue of whether TRQs are efficient trade policy instruments for improving market access has been widely debated. Some believe that TRQs impose an extra barrier to trade, circumvent the reforms sought under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and World Trade Organization (WTO) and may not be as attractive as initially envisioned. Others believe that the TRQs are useful and facilitate trade and liberalization. Any expansion in quota, or decrease in tariffs, or combinations of the two, has the potential to liberalize trade in a specific industry. There is strong clamor for continued reforms in the conduct of agricultural trade – including the implementation of TRQs. The purpose of this study is to increase the understanding of TRQs, and determine the impact of their implementation on the Philippine corn market. Specifically, the study will estimate the quantities of supply, demand, imports, domestic equilibrium prices, and border prices under different TRQ liberalization regimes. &#xd;
In this study, an existing TRQ model was utilized to determine how effective TRQs are as a trade policy instrument for trade liberalization and increasing market access. The results reveal that the Philippine corn market was restricted by the out-quota tariff. De facto liberalization of the TRQ at the level of the out-quota rate (50%) or even at 35% (in-quota rate), does not completely liberalize the corn market. Progressively reducing both tariffs liberalizes the market and leads to increases in surpluses. The lower tariffs, however, lead to less government revenues. The smaller the gap between the in-quota and out-quota, the smaller the quota rents become. Increasing the quotas has no significant impact in liberalizing the corn market, and the increase in imports decrease producer surplus in all cases. &#xd;
The TRQ model of the Philippine corn sector reveals that changing the components of the TRQ would lead to different impacts on supply, demand, consumer, producer and net surplus, and government revenues. Knowledge of the regime in which the country is trading can determine which individual policy instrument of the TRQ, the in-quota and out-quota tariff and the quota, should be used to increase market access or address the concerns of stakeholders in the corn sector. It is thus important for policy makers to find a workable tariff level that would serve the interest of all stakeholders in the sector.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Oil exports, non-oil exports and economic growth: time series analysis for Kuwait (1970-2004)</dc:title>

<dc:description>Kuwait is an oil-based economy that adopts an export promotion policy as the fundamental strategy for economic growth. The country has experienced remarkable economic growth and high per capita GDP for the last four decades. The export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis has been commonly used to examine the impact of exports on economic growth. Numerous studies support this hypothesis and found evidence that exports have a significant positive relationship with economic growth. However, it is not yet known how effective the ELG hypothesis is in small oil producing country like Kuwait. The central question addressed is whether the ELG hypothesis is valid in the case of Kuwait. &#xd;
This empirical research investigates the relationship of two components of exports (oil exports and non-oil exports) with economic growth by examining the ELG hypothesis using annual time series data for the Kuwaiti economy over the period 1970-2004. The study applies a number of econometric techniques: unit root test, cointegration test, error correction model (ECM), impulse responds function (IRF), and Granger causality test. &#xd;
The results of this dissertation show that all the variables are stationary in the first difference. Moreover, the cointegration test confirms the existence of the long run relationship among the three variables. The Granger test shows bidirectional causality between oil exports and economic growth, and a unidirectional causality from non-oil exports to economic growth. However, the causality results are consistent with the results reported by the ECM.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Degenerative valve disease is the most common cardiac affliction facing our canine population.  To date, canine research has focused on characterizing the disease itself and the histopathological features.  Because of the ability to routinely repair or replace diseased valves in human medicine, research focus in humans has been on perfecting these techniques rather than elucidating etiology.  The recent interest in valvular interstitial cells has been primarily due to their capacity to degrade collagen with the knowledge that disorganized collagen is a hallmark characteristic of degenerative valve disease.  In this project, an easily reproducible cell culture protocol for canine valvular interstitial cells was developed.  These cells were phenotyped by utilization of RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry.  The use of these cells in a research project looking at response to endothelin exposure with and without protection of vitamin E is demonstrated as an example of the unlimited possibilities for these cells to elucidate not only the etiology of the disease process but also the response to therapy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The overall objective of these experiments was to develop management and feeding programs to increase sow longevity and productivity by improving welfare conditions.  In Exp. 1, 208 gestating sows and 288 gestating gilts were utilized to determine the effect of feeding frequency (2 vs. 6) on performance and welfare issues.  Feeding frequency had no affect on growth and reproductive performance in gestating sows; however, increasing the feeding frequency did improve the welfare measurements in this trial.  Gilts fed six times a day did have increase ADG during d 0 to 42; however, there was no affect on performance from d 42 to farrowing.  In Exp. 2 (630 pigs in 4 studies), increasing the feeding frequency (2 vs. 6) of a restricted feeding level increased growth performance of finishing pigs.  This affect is likely due to the increase of available energy above maintenance when compared with the gestating sows.  In Exp. 3, different feed drops used for delivering feed were evaluated.  The Accu and the Ultra feed drops were more accurate than the Econo feed drop at angles of 90, 75, and 60°.  The difference in accuracy is potentially related to the way that the drops attach to the feed line.  However, the amount of feed that is collected in each drop appears to increase linearly as the feeder settings are increased.  Thus, regression equations for the angle of the feed drop can be developed to adjust for the variability in the amount of accumulated feed.  In Exp. 4, Alimet® was used to determine the TID TSAA:Lys ratio for ADG and G:F of 63 and 66% for Genetiporc and 61 and 56% for PIC pigs weighing between 10 to 20 kg.  In Exp. 5, the optimal TID Lys:Calorie ratio was estimated to be 3.7 and 4.1 g Lys/Mcal ME for the Genetiporc and PIC pigs weighing between 10 to 20 kg .  The ratios were than validated at two energy levels and the amount of TID Lys that was used for lean gain was similar for both genetic lines at approximately 20 g of Lys for each kg of gain.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Over 50 years of research has supported the positive relationship between feedback and performance improvement. A recent meta-analysis suggests that feedback may not be beneficial for performance, and that it may actually be harmful for performance (Kluger &amp; DeNisi, 1996). This study suggests that these inconsistencies exist because positive and negative feedback are treated like opposite sides of the same scale. In reality, positive and negative feedback are two very different types of information and should be treated differently.&#xd;
Current research examines feedback delivered interpersonally. When delivering feedback this way, positive feedback is often accepted while negative feedback is rejected. The current study states that alternate delivery methods may be better for the acceptance and use of negative feedback. It is suggested that negative feedback received directly from the task itself may be more accepted, more intrinsically motivating, and result in less negative emotion for receivers than negative feedback from interpersonal sources. Two hundred and two university students participated in a simple computer simulation task. They received feedback regarding their performance and then participated in the task a second time.&#xd;
Results revealed no differences between conditions in acceptance, possibly a result of task. When receiving negative feedback from the task, participants experienced greater intrinsic motivation than when receiving negative feedback from interpersonal sources. Finally, negative feedback from the task resulted in less negative emotion than negative feedback from interpersonal sources. By removing the interpersonal interaction, the task removes a great deal of negative emotion associated with the supervisor.&#xd;
This study revealed great potential for the task as a source of negative feedback. Although the workforce may not be ready for a full task-feedback system, it may serve as a good supplement for interpersonal feedback and worthy of future research in the field setting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this exploratory case study was to explore the middle school science classroom of a constructivist teacher and examine how constructivist-based teaching influences ELL students and their learning of science. The researcher’s purpose was to discover patterns which emerged after close observations, careful documentation, and thoughtful analysis of the research topic. What was discovered by this exploratory case study was not sweeping generalizations but contextual findings.&#xd;
	This case study was conducted in the spring of 2006. The researcher sought to answer the question, “How does constructivist teaching help middle school English Language Learners understand science?” Two variable clusters were examined: 1) the independent variable cluster of the constructivist teaching practices of the one selected teacher; and 2) the dependent variable cluster of the middle school English Language Learners understanding of the science concepts being taught. Four broad categories of data were collected: 1) observations of teaching and learning (including teaching plans and other teaching materials); 2) interviews related to teaching and learning; 3) inventories of teaching and learning; and 4) artifacts of learning.&#xd;
	Steve Loos an eighth grade middle school science teacher is an expert constructivist-based teacher. His teaching influences English Language Learners understanding of the science concepts being taught. Steve’s teaching influenced the English Language Learners through a variety of pedagogical strategies. The researcher concluded in this study that, “Constructivist teaching helps middle school English Language Learners understand science.”</dc:description>

<dc:description>Global climate change could lead to less frequent but more severe precipitation events in the Great Plains, altering the hydrologic regimes of streams.  It is important to quantify species roles in these dynamic systems, because changes in stream communities are likely to accompany predicted changes in hydrology.  The effects of species on ecosystem processes also are limited by the frequency of disturbance, because prairie streams are harsh, nonequilibrium systems characterized by a wide range of disturbances.  In particular, frequent floods that reset the ecosystem to an early successional state can override the influence of consumer populations because the availability of resources is too unpredictable to maintain stable populations of those species or because species are absent following the flood.  As flood frequency decreases, potential consumer effects may intensify.  Using a combination of field and experimental stream mesocosm experiments, I (1) characterized the ecosystem effects of southern redbelly dace (Phoxinus erythrogaster), a grazing minnow, (2) tested the interactive effects of flood frequency and the presence of water column (red shiner; Cyprinella lutrensis) or grazing minnows (Phoxinus) on ecosystem processes, and (3) tested the effects of species loss from the grazer functional feeding group on stream ecosystem structure and function.  I found that dace affected some aspects of ecosystem structure but not function, which suggested that grazer effects in prairie streams may not be consistent across taxa.  In the context of flood frequency, both the water column omnivore and dace affected recovery of prairie stream primary producers following flooding disturbance by stimulating production, presumably through nutrient remineralization.  However, some of these effects were transient or dependent on flood frequency, and my results indicate that consumer effects depend not only on environmental venue but also on the balance between consumptive losses and nutrient stimulation.  In a comparison of the effects of removing different taxa from a grazer assemblage, the loss of crayfish, snails, or dace from a grazer assemblage did not differentially affect ecosystem processes, suggesting overlap in the ecosystem roles of these species in the context of this experiment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Post-anthesis high temperature stress in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major cause of yield reduction. This process results in the loss of viable leaf area and a decrease in green leaf duration ultimately causing a yield loss. The objectives of this study were to (i) phenotype a recombinant inbred line population for heat tolerance traits, (ii) understand the genetic basis of heat tolerance by mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to yield-related traits under high temperature, (iii) model stay-green under high temperature stress and map the QTL linked to stay-green parameters, and (iv) validate the markers linked to QTL under field conditions. A filial6:7 (F6:7) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was developed by crossing Ventnor, a heat-tolerant white winter wheat with Karl 92, a relatively heat susceptible hard red winter wheat. From 10 DAA to maturity, the treatments of optimum temperature or high temperature stress (30/25°C) were imposed on the RILs. The traits measured included grain filling duration (GFD), kernels per spike, thousand kernel weight (TKW), and grain filling rate (GFR). The stay-green traits calculated were: i) time between 75% and 25% green, ii) maximum rate of senescence, iii) time to maximum rate of senescence, and v) percent green at maximum senescence. Genetic characterization was performed using microsatellite (SSR), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and a sequence tag site (STS) markers. GFD was positively correlated with TKW and negatively with GFR and maximum rate of senescence. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed kernels per spike, maximum rate of senescence, and TKW accounted for 98% of total variability among the genotypes for heat tolerance. The most significant QTL for yield traits co-localized with marker Xgwm296 for TKW, Xgwm356 for kernels per spike, and Xksum61 for GFR. The QTL for stay-green traits co-localized with markers P41/M62-107 on Chromosome 2A, Xbarc136 on Chromosome 2D, P58/MC84-146 on Chromosome 3B, P58/M77-343 on Chromosome 6A, and. P58/MC84-406 on Chromosome 6B. These results indicate that increased green leaf area duration has a positive effect on the grain yield under high temperature. Once the kernels per spike are established, GFD and TKW can be used as selection criteria for post-anthesis heat-tolerance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Technological advances affect the very fabric of our world, from the way we do business to the way we educate children.  The National Education Association (2005), predicted that by 2006, most school children would take at least one course online before graduating from high school.  The Peak Group estimated that by 2006, one million K-12 students would enroll in online courses (Davis &amp; Niederhauser, 2007).  In March, 2006, Michigan passed legislation requiring high school students to have at least one online educational experience to graduate (eSchoolNews, 2006).  Online classes open doors to educational opportunities students might not otherwise have due to lack of sufficient student interest in a subject, school budgets, or teacher expertise.  The quality of programs, in terms of academic rigor and compliance to state educational standards, varies widely.  &#xd;
Research examining and documenting online education explicitly in K-12 settings has only recently been conducted and published (Blomeyer, 2002) and there is very little of it.  This dissertation is a case study of three virtual high school programs, two well established programs and one that is only two years old.  Administrator and teachers were interviewed and an examination of program documents to define what attributes and characteristics indicate a high quality program, what commonalities are found among online high school programs, and what online teachers and programs do to assure a high quality learning experience for students.  &#xd;
Findings include:  Extensive descriptions of each program regarding course design, teacher training, program organization and funding, and administration.  Common themes across participating programs included concerns related to collaboration, high quality courses – whether vendor provided or faculty written, professional development of online teachers, finding ways to control quality of courses from design to student learning and student satisfaction, and the importance of competent and enthusiastic teachers.  Recommendations, based on the findings of this study, are that administrators considering joining an online high school program should look at course catalog, professional development, quality control, teachers, service and support, any additional benefits from joining the program, and ability to access administrators and teachers currently using the program or references.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fusobacterium necrophorum, a gram negative anaerobe and an opportunistic pathogen, causes necrotic infections in humans and animals.  Two subspecies of F. necrophorum, subsp. necrophorum and subsp. funduliforme are described.  Leukotoxin (Lkt), a secreted protein encoded by a tricistronic operon (lktBAC), is the major virulence factor of F. necrophorum.  The concentration of Lkt produced by subsp. necrophorum is higher than that of subsp. funduliforme.  Quantitative-PCR was used to determine the relative expression of lktA by the two subspecies of bovine origin.  The mRNA transcript of lktA was detectable in early-log phase of growth in subsp. necrophorum, whereas in subsp. funduliforme, the lktA transcript was detected only in the mid-log phase.  Q-PCR analysis revealed that subsp. necrophorum had 20-fold more lktA transcript than subsp. funduliforme.  The amount of lktA transcript declined by late-log phase in both subspecies; but lktA mRNA levels in subsp. necrophorum was 8-fold higher than in subsp. funduliforme.  Leukotoxin protein stability assays showed the Lkt to be stable in both subspecies despite the decrease in the concentration of the protein during late-log phase.&#xd;
&#xd;
The subspecies identity of human F. necrophorum strains and whether they possess lktA and leukotoxin activity are not known.  Human clinical isolates (n = 4) of F. necrophorum were identified as subsp. funduliforme based on 16S rRNA sequence and absence of hemagglutinin gene.  Four human strains had the lkt promoter, lktB, and lktC similar to that of subsp. funduliforme.  One strain had full length lktA, while other three strains exhibited considerable heterogeneity.  All four strains secreted Lkt that was toxic to human leukocytes.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Fusobacterium equinum, formerly F. necrophorum, is a newly recognized species.  It is associated with infections of the respiratory tract in horses.  Little is known about the virulence factors of F. equinum.  Southern hybridization revealed that F. equinum strains had lktA gene with greater similarities to F. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum.  The toxicity of culture supernatants of isolates to equine leukocytes was variable.  Our data indicate that F. equinum isolates possess lktA gene and exhibit leukotoxin activity.  The importance of leukotoxin as a virulence factor in human and equine fusobacterial infections needs to be investigated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was aimed at understanding the retrospective experiences of adults who have fathers who are cross-dressers. This study addressed common concerns that partners of men who cross-dress have regarding the impact of fathers’ cross-dressing on children. Previous research indicated that some women in relationships with men who cross-dress actively chose to not have children due to not knowing what effects their partner’s cross-dressing may have on children. &#xd;
Qualitative data from five interviews conducted with adult children of cross-dressing fathers was utilized. Participants reflected upon the following areas: The individual and relational factors that impacted their reaction to having fathers who are cross-dressers; the meanings they created about their fathers’ being cross-dressers; the perceived impact on their social development; and advice they would give to others that may promote the adjustment process for children who have fathers who cross-dress. &#xd;
This study revealed thick description of the adjustment processes for a sample of adult children of cross-dressing fathers. Specifically, the results revealed that the participants adjusted to having fathers who are cross-dressers relatively easily. The closeness of their relationships, the timing and nature of disclosure, their fathers’ comfort levels with being cross-dressers, and the familial response to the fathers’ cross-dressing were all revealed to play important roles in the participants’ acceptance of and adjustment to their fathers’ being cross-dressers. Overall, the participants identified more positive effects than negative in reference to their relationships with their fathers and their social adjustment. This research can assist clinicians in helping couples facing this issue to make informed decisions about having children and in deciding the timing and the preferred circumstances in which fathers should disclose their cross-dressing to their children.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The first essay develops a simple sequential-move game to characterize the endogeneity of third-party intervention in conflict. We show how a third party’s “intervention technology” interacts with the canonical “conflict technologies” of two rival parties in affecting the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium outcome. From the perspective of deterrence strategy, we find that it is more costly for a third party to support an ally to deter a challenger from attacking (i.e., to maintain peace), as compared to the alternative case when the third party supports the ally to gain a disputed territory by attacking (i.e., to create war), ceteris paribus. However, an optimally intervening third party can be either “peace-making,” “peace-breaking,” or neither depending on the characteristics of the conflict and the third party’s stake with each of the rival parties.  &#xd;
The second essay develops a simple model to characterize the role that an intervening third party plays in raising the cost of rebellion in an intrastate conflict. Extending the Gershenson-Grossman (2000) framework of conflict in a two-stage game to the case involving outside intervention in a three-stage game, we examine conditions under which an outside party optimally intervenes such that (i) the strength of the rebel group is diminished or (ii) the rebellion is deterred altogether. We also find conditions in which a third party optimally intervenes at a level insufficient to deter rebellion. Such behavior, which improves the incumbent government’s potential to succeed in conflict, is often overlooked in conflict studies evaluating the effectiveness of intervention. One policy implication of the model is that an increase in the strength of inter-governmental trade partnerships increases the likelihood that third-party intervention acts to deter rebellion. &#xd;
&#xd;
In the final essay, a simple model of a college basketball season is constructed to examine the existence of conference bias in college basketball’s Ratings Percentage Index. Given the nature of the RPI formula and the hierarchical structure of college basketball’s 31 conferences, we expect the RPI to be biased against teams playing a difficult conference schedule. The model verifies that, even in a perfect world where teams play to expectation and can be transitively compared based on revealed performance level, the RPI does not necessarily provide an ordinal mapping from revealed team ability level to the real number line. This result has important implications on NCAA tournament selection and seeding.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is integrated on a numerical lattice for up to three-dimensional problems. The wave packet propagation technique has been applied to ion – atom collisions in a strong laser field, the vibrational nuclear motion in small &#xd;
homonuclear diatomic molecular ions, and for the scattering of an ion in front of a metallic surface. For laser-assisted proton – hydrogen collisions it is shown, that strong circularly polarized radiation significantly alters the capture and ionization probabilities and results in a dichroism with respect to the helicity. In a pump – control – probe scheme, “stroboscopic” exposure of a nuclear wave packet of the deuterium molecular ion by a single or a series of short and intense laser control pulses may be used to produce an almost stationary distribution of a single vibrational level, where the nodal structure can be tested using the Coulomb explosion imaging technique. Using a pump – probe setup with variable probe delays it is proposed to use Fourier analysis of the time dependence of the Coulomb explosion kinetic energy release spectrum to reveal insight into the initial vibrational state distribution for small diatomic molecules. A last application demonstrates, that resonant charge transfer for scattering of a negative hydrogen anion on a metal surface depends crucially on the position of surface and image states relative to the conduction and valence band, thereby implying different reaction mechanisms for different surface cuts of a metal.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study sought to understand reasons for participation and non-participation in national incident management system (NIMS) and incident command system (ICS) training by elected officials in the state of Kansas as well as motivations and perceived barriers to participation in this training. County commissioners and mayors from first class and second class cities in the state were the population for this study (n = 202). One instrument comprised of three parts was utilized; a slightly modified version of the Deterrents to Participation Scale (DPS-G) developed by Darkenwald and Valentine in 1984, a slightly modified version of the Education Participation Scale (EPS-A) used by Morstain and Smart (1974) and based on the original work of Boshier (1971), and the third part of the instrument which gathered demographic information. &#xd;
Findings for the study noted that while there was a self-reported percentage of over 51% completion of NIMS training, the target population may be unaware of the Homeland Security and Kansas Emergency Management parameter for participation and are not in compliance with the emergency management institute (EMI) testing and reporting standards. The question of motivations to participation noted that although the EPS-A showed strong reliability to the target population, upon closer scrutiny the questions did not align for this population as they had for previously surveyed populations.  A new version of the EPS for elected officials has been suggested for subsequent studies. The DPS-G was found to be a valid and reliable instrument for the target population.  Additional demographic variables of age, rural/urban and time in position were explored. None of these variables were found to be significant to the participation decision.  The possibility of a prediction model for participation was explored through a stepwise logistic regression.  The model should be explored further utilizing several factors from the DPS – G (personal problems, lack of personal priority, and lack of confidence) as possible significant barriers. The qualitative responses on the survey noted the high percentage of respondents that had a lack of knowledge or understanding of the requirements or had questions on availability of the training.  Implications and recommendations for the target populations and to the field of study are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In England, 1532‐1649 was an era during which questions about obedience to rulers dominated ethical discussions.  Most English people also respected biblical authority for governing certain behaviors.  Obedience was central to the monarchy’s survival and the Bible was central to reformation of an English Church laden with medieval accretions.  St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans 13:1‐7 was the most important biblical passage for understanding the Christian’s relationship to civil authority during this period, and interpreters had such high regard for biblical authority that the backing of this passage was crucial to the acceptance of any political theory that involved ideas about obedience or disobedience.&#xd;
   &#xd;
Though eisegesis was not out of the question as a technique among these interpreters, societal and political circumstances motivated most exegetes to examine the text more closely than they might have if St. Paul’s meaning had been irrelevant.  These conditions led to creative handling of the text that permitted the exegetes to continue to submit to biblical authority while advocating their varied opinions on obedience to civil authority.  Some interpreters moved outside the constraints of traditional views of monarchy and obedience to develop a theory that God mediated his call to rulers through those who elected them.  Acceptance of this theory finally brought about rejection of divine right monarchy, as symbolized by the execution of Charles I in 1649.  By too quickly concluding that these English expositors merely sought biblical justification for their views after the fact, scholars have failed to appreciate how Romans 13 positively shaped Reformation views of the Christian’s relationship to the state.&#xd;
 &#xd;
As the title suggests, this study will examine the discernable shift from seeing Romans 13:1‐7 as a text that commands non‐resistance to rulers to one that not only permits disobedience, but requires it.  Thus, Romans 13 is not simply an influential political text, but stands as the most important political text of the period under consideration.  This dissertation supplies a needed analysis of representative exegesis of Romans 13:1‐7 during this critical period of English history and considers the influence of these expositions on the development of republian ideals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper asks why a progressive social movement formed in a conservative place. The People for a Progressive University City (PPUC) formed as a Political Action Committee (PAC) in a mid-sized community in order to influence the city commission and school board election of 2005. Resource Mobilization theory assumes that social movements form when they have access to resources including money, networks and leadership (Barkan 1979, McCarthy and Zald 1977). Political Opportunity theory assumes that social movements form when opportunities for mobilization are visible (Goodwin, Jaspers and Jaswin 1999, Tarrow 1996). The Framing Perspective assumes that social movements form when they describe grievances and their solutions in a way that is reasonable to potential participants (Benford and Snow 2000, Gamson and Modigliani 1989). I have taken an Action Research approach to understand what developments led to the organization’s formation and which theory best described why the movement formed in 2005. Through 31 in-depth interviews with community members, I concluded that no one theory alone can explain why the organization formed. I argue that the best theoretical explanation is a synthesis of all three. I outline several theoretical implications as well as practical implications for community organizing in University City. I argue that the future of the PPUC will depend on how it responds to changes in community discontent and if it is able to mobilize people. Additionally, I suggest the story of the PPUC has implications for the study of social movements in general.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In today’s production agricultural sector, managing risk is essential to insuring the economic well being and sustainability of successful enterprises.  Considering the inherent risks present in today’s agricultural arena, risk management has become the central focus of discussions for policy makers and producers alike.  Therefore the objective of this research paper is to examine the impact a whole-farm adjusted gross revenue insurance risk management program (AGR-Lite) has on reducing farm income variability using historical farm level data for Southeast Kansas farms.    &#xd;
	A panel data set of actual farm level income data was compiled to evaluate the impact of AGR-Lite on farm income variability for 219 Southeast Kansas farms.  Although actual income tax records were not available annual data over the period 1993 to 2005 from the Kansas Farm Management Association was used to reproduce the essential information a farm manager would need from IRS form 1040 schedule F and inventory records to purchase AGR-Lite (Langemeier, 2003).  Income distributions for each farm from 1999 to 2005 were calculated for two strategies; the farm manager did not insure and the manager insured each year using AGR-Lite as a stand-alone product.  The AGR-Lite insurance strategy assumed a 75% coverage level and 90% payment rate.  The income distributions were compared using three premium scenarios.&#xd;
     In general, the results of this study reveal participation in the AGR-Lite program, in most instances, reduced standard deviation, Coefficient of Variation (CV), and Downside Risk (DR).  Additionally average minimums and Certainty Equivalents (CE) were increased with the product.  The following results reflect application of Actuarially Fair Average Rate for farms with Indemnities (AFARI), which is believed to reflect actual market performance.  Additionally the following reflects results using Net Farm Income (NFI).  Results reveal that purchasing AGR-Lite reduced standard deviations 7.01%, 11.34%, 0.29%, and 2.53% for total, crop, livestock, and dairy farms assuming AFARI.  However beef farms were the lone category to sustain a 0.81% standard deviation increase.  Despite reductions in absolute variability, relative risk (CV) increased 18.94%, 17.12%, 53.84%, and 3.19% for total, livestock, beef, and dairy.  Crop farms were the only category to generate a CV reduction (9.52%).  Under AFARI crop farms generated the largest minimum increase, reducing downside risk, by 69.97%.  For total and dairy farm categories average minimums increased 62.93% and 0.60%.  The remaining farm categories, livestock and beef, yielded 65.07% and 57.03% reductions to average minimum.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to identify the informational resources used by small manufacturing owners who were in the NAICS 336 sector of manufacturers in Sedgwick County, Kansas, and determine which are most helpful to the owner in managing their business. Prior studies have utilized all small businesses and have not examined industry specific information gathering.  &#xd;
	A qualitative method was used in the study using a semi-structured interview process to provide in-depth information from the perspective of the small manufacturing owner. The semi-structured interview identified the information resources used by small manufacturing owners in managing their business and the level of helpfulness those resources had for them. &#xd;
	Ten small manufacturers whose owner was on site and employed from 20-100 employees were used in the study. Informal resources were most often used by this group of manufacturers. The Internet was identified by the manufacturers as the most important and useful resource to managing their businesses. The small manufacturers used multiple resources to manage their business and rarely relied on only one resource of information whether it was for financial, management, marketing/sales or benchmarking information.  Formal sources of information such as colleges, trade schools and seminars were less frequently used. Nonformal resources which were mostly governmental and included the Small Business Association, Small Business Development Center, Manufacturing Extension Partnerships, SCORE, local and federal government resources were rarely used by this group of manufacturers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The first part of this thesis deals with the syntheses of ovalicin and its analogues. Ovalicin inhibits the endothelial cell proliferation. Apart from being anti-angiogenic it also exhibits antibiotic, antitumor, and immunosuppressive properties. Unlike other syntheses, we started with an acyclic compound, ethyl propiolate (1.66). Our flexible route towards the synthesis used intramolecular Heck cyclization reaction to construct an appropriately functionalized 3-methylene-6-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)cyclohexene (1.63) from 1.66 in four steps. A number of synthetic analogues were synthesized via this strategy. Upon selective epoxidation and dihydroxylation of 1.63, a mixture of diols (3S*,4R*,5S*,6S*)-6-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-1-oxaspiro[2.5]octane-4,5-diol (1.107) and (3S*,4S*,5R*,6R*)-6-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-1-oxaspiro[2.5]octane-4,5-diol (1.108) were obtained. Subsequent functional group transformations of diols 1.107 and 1.108 gave ketones (3S*,4S*,5R*,6R*)-6-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-5-methoxy-1-oxaspiro[2.5]octan-4-one (1.112) and (3S*,5S*,6S*)-6-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-5-methoxy-1-oxaspiro[2.5]octan -4-one (1.117). Addition of vinyl lithium to the ketones followed by functional group transformation gave ovalicin analogues. Several intermediates were subjected to biological activity test for inhibition of growth of T. brucei. Our synthetic efforts towards the synthesis of ovalicin are discussed.&#xd;
	The second part of my thesis deals with the synthesis of different tricyclic pyrone (TP) analogues which inhibit the aggregation of Aβ peptides. Alzhemier’s disease (AD) is caused by accumulation of fibrillar amyloid deposits in the AD brain. We synthesized a series of tricyclic pyrone derivatives and evaluated their counteraction on amyloid toxicity. TP analogue, (5aS,7S)-7-[(1R) and (1S)-2-(N3-adenyl)-1-methylethyl]-3-methyl-1H,7H-5a,6,8,9-tetrahyro-1-oxopyranol[4,3 -b] [1] benzopyran (CP2) is nontoxic, small and permeable molecule prevents the death of human neuroblastoma MC65 cells that conditionally expressed SβC gene. We further found that CP2 ameliorates the toxicity and inhibits the formation of Aβ oligomeric complexes. Binding studies using surface plasma resonance and atomic force microscopy studies suggest that CP2 permeates into the cells and interacts with Aβ peptides and inhibits the Aβ oligomerization. To understand the mechanism of Aβ aggregation and toxicity, CP2 and its derivatives are synthesized to evaluate their action. The key intermediate in the synthesis of CP2 is (5aS*,7S*)-7-[(1R*) and (1S*)-2-bromo-1-methylethyl]-3-methyl-1H,7H-5a,6,8,9-tetrahyro-1-oxopyranol[4,3-b][1] benzopyran (2.9), which in turn can be prepared from our previously reported method. Our aim is to synthesize a series of compounds and investigate the biological activities of different TP analogues.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The wild relatives of crop plants are sources of useful genes, but such genes when transferred to agricultural crops are often associated with deleterious traits. Because most of the recombination and the disease resistance genes are localized towards the ends of wheat chromosomes, cryptic terminal alien segments, carrying rust resistance genes, were transferred from Aegilops geniculata (UgMg) and Ae. triuncialis (UtCt) into common wheat without the usual linkage drag. The alien segment with the leaf rust and stripe rust resistance genes Lr57 and Yr40 in translocation T5DL•5DS-5MgS(0.95) was found to be less than 3.3 cM in genetic length and spans less than four overlapping BAC/PAC clones of the syntenic rice chromosome arm 12L. The alien segment with leaf rust resistance gene Lr58, transferred from Ae. triuncialis, was found to be less than 5% of the chromosome arm 2BL of wheat in T2BS•2BL-2tL(0.95), further suggesting that it is feasible to transfer small alien segments with disease resistance genes. Resistance genes Lr57, Yr40 and Lr58 were transferred to Kansas hard red winter wheat cultivars by backcrossing and marker assisted selection. &#xd;
	Tillering, a key component of grain yield, and seed color which influences seed dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting in wheat, are agronomically important domestication traits in wheat. A tiller inhibition mutant with monoculm phenotype was isolated and the mutated gene (tin3) was mapped on the distal region of chromosome arm 3AmL of T. monococcum. As a first step towards isolating candidate gene(s), the tin3 and the seed color gene (R-A1) of chromosome 3A  were mapped in relation to physically mapped ESTs and STS markers developed based on synteny with rice. Physically mapped wheat ESTs provided a useful framework to identify closely related rice sequences and to establish the most likely syntenous region in rice for the wheat tin3 and R-A1 region. Comparative genomic analysis of the tin3 and R-A1 genomic regions with the corresponding region in rice localized the tin3 gene to a 324 kb region spanned by two overlapping BACs and the R-A1 gene was mapped to a single BAC of the colinear rice chromosome arm 1L.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In perennial grasslands, the belowground population of meristems (the bud bank) plays a &#xd;
fundamental role in local plant population structure and dynamics. I tested the “meristem &#xd;
limitation hypothesis” prediction that bud banks increase along an increasing &#xd;
precipitation/productivity gradient in North American grasslands. I sampled bud populations &#xd;
quarterly at six sites across a 1,100 km gradient in central North America. Bud banks increased &#xd;
with average annual precipitation, which explained 80% of variability in bud banks among sites. &#xd;
Seasonal changes in grass bud banks were surprisingly similar across a 2.5-fold range in &#xd;
precipitation and a 4-fold range of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). Secondly, I &#xd;
tested the hypothesis that tallgrass prairie plants respond to increases in a limiting resource &#xd;
(nitrogen) through demographic effects on the bud bank. I parameterized matrix models for &#xd;
individual genets, considering each genet as a population of plant parts (buds and stems). &#xd;
Nitrogen addition significantly impacted bud bank demography of both Sporobolus heterolepis &#xd;
and Koeleria macrantha. In 2005, emergence from the bud bank and growth rates (λ) of the tiller &#xd;
population were significantly higher in S. heterolepis genets that received nitrogen. In contrast, nitrogen addition decreased λ in K. macrantha. Both prospective and retrospective analyses indicated that bud bank dynamics are the key demographic processes driving genet responses to nutrient availability. Lastly, I tested the hypothesis that the effects of fire and grazing on plant species composition and ANPP are mediated principally through demographic effects on bud &#xd;
banks. I found that plants respond to fire and grazing with altered rates of belowground bud &#xd;
natality, bud emergence, and both short-term (fire cycle) and long-term changes in bud density. &#xd;
The size of the bud bank is an excellent predictor of long-term ANPP, supporting my hypothesis &#xd;
that ANPP is strongly regulated by belowground demographic processes. Meristem limitation &#xd;
due to water or nutrient availability or management practices such as fire and grazing may &#xd;
constrain grassland responses to inter-annual changes in resource availability. An important &#xd;
consequence is that grasslands with a large bud bank may be the most responsive to future &#xd;
climatic change or other phenomena such as nutrient enrichment, and may be most resistant to &#xd;
exotic species invasions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Although the processes by which fathers’ presence in the home affect children’s development is not known exactly, ongoing research is making strides toward a greater understanding of this concept (Lamb, 2000). Much of the research conducted on fathering came from researchers’ applying measures and concepts developed to understand mothering. This comparison of fathering and mothering has yielded little understanding of the processes by which father involvement can influence child development and, only in recent decades, has fathering begun to be studied using separate measures designed specifically to understand the unique aspects of fathering (Marsiglio, Amato, Day, &amp; Lamb, 2001). To date, the effects of father involvement in families have been highlighted as a key factor in child growth and development, prevention of poverty, and as a buffer against adolescent risk-taking behaviors (Day &amp; Lamb, 2004). However, in some cases, father involvement can have a very negative effect on children in families, and counter examples of research, showing the deleterious effects of negative father involvement, add an important aspect to fathering studies (Pleck, 2003). Unfortunately, the contradictory opinions and information found in research literature offer practitioners limited information upon which to base their work with fathers and their families. The following is a review of current research literature on father involvement, with an emphasis on families with adolescents.&#xd;
Recent improvements in researchers’ understanding and measurement of father involvement offer practical information for mental health practitioners. The written portion of this report will review current research on father involvement with adolescent children, and then in the presentation, offer suggestions for applying current fathering research to counseling practice. The goal of this report is to offer information that will narrow the research to practice gap for those working with adolescents and their families. Despite the flurry of research on father involvement in recent decades, little appears to have been done to make this research readily available to practitioners. Thus, current practices are limited, in that they are not benefiting from past research on father involvement and are not evolving with improved conceptualization and measurement of fathering activities.&#xd;
Given the current emphasis on evidence-based practice, this report is meant to be an added resource for practitioners, intending to help fathers in families with adolescents. In addition to a critical review of key works focusing on the effects of father involvement on adolescent children, this report will add insight to the work that clinicians do by discussing current perspectives in the fathering literature and offering suggestions for applying these ideas in the talk-therapy arena. Father influence on children during adolescence is the focus of this report due to research evidence showing that fathers influence may become increasingly important in the later stages of child development.

<dc:description>The goal of this study was to explore the use of interdisciplinary PBL projects for teaching mathematical concepts according to NCTM (2000) goals for mathematics instruction. This study sought to answer the question: what are the teaching issues and evidence of student learning of mathematical concepts over a series of three interdisciplinary PBL projects involving STELLA™ modeling software which are designed to engage students, integrate technology, and provide a context for learning mathematics based on the 5 NCTM (2000) goals? HyperStudio™ was used as a communication tool with which students built artifacts of understanding.&#xd;
This study was a naturalistic case study employing videotaped observations, interviews, student-peer reviews and student generated artifacts of learning as data sources. Data were categorized into two variable clusters: Teaching and Learning.&#xd;
Implementation issues for three computer-based PBL simulations are discussed. Themes that emerged from analysis of the data are grouped into teaching themes and learning themes.&#xd;
Themes relating to teaching include the struggle to form a community of learners, relevancy of the simulations to middle school students, need for group-worthy projects, helping students balance creativity and content, lesson adaptation, and critical review and student reflection on&#xd;
constructive feedback. Findings of the study suggest the students were able to meet a majority of the expected content goals. Themes relating to learning include the struggle to find a balance between creativity and content, ownership and control, engagement with the simulations,&#xd;
and students’ ability to think and express themselves mathematically. Recommendations are made for teachers who wish to implement PBL, simulations, and similar teaching strategies and for researchers who are studying similar learning environments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Irrigated cropping systems on the High Plains are dominated by water intensive continuous corn (Zea mays L.) production, which along with other factors has caused a decline in the Ogallala aquifer. Potentially demand for water from the aquifer could be decreased by including drought tolerant crops, like grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), in the cropping systems. This study calibrated the CERES-Maize, CERES-Sorghum, and CROPGRO-Cotton models for the High Plains and studied the simulated effects of different irrigation amounts and initial soil water contents on corn, cotton, and grain sorghum. Input files for calibration were created from irrigated and dryland research plots across Kansas. Information was collected on: soil physical properties, dry matter, leaf area, initial and final soil water content, management, and weather. CERES-Maize simulated grain yield, kernel number, ear number, and seed weight across the locations with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2891 kg ha-1, 1283 kernels m-2, 1.6 ears m-2, and 38.02 mg kernel-1, respectively. CERES-Sorghum simulated grain yield, kernel number, head number, and seed weight with RMSEs of 2150 kg ha-1, 5755 kernels m-2, 0.13 heads m-2, and 4.51 mg kernel-1. CROPGRO-Cotton simulated lint yield and boll number with RMSEs of 487 kg ha-1 and 25.97 bolls m-2. &#xd;
Simulations were also conducted with CERES-Maize, CERES-Sorghum, and CROPGRO-Cotton to evaluate the effects of irrigation amounts and initial soil water content on yield, evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE), available soil&#xd;
water at maturity, and gross income per hectare. Simulations used weather data from&#xd;
Garden City, KS from 1961 to 1999. Irrigation amounts were different for all variables&#xd;
for corn and grain sorghum. For cotton, yield, WUE, soil water, and gross income were&#xd;
not different between the top two irrigation amounts. For corn and grain sorghum, initial&#xd;
soil water content was only different at 50% plant available water. Initial soil water had&#xd;
no affect on cotton, except for ET at 50%. Simulations showed that cotton yields are&#xd;
similar at lower irrigation. Also, cropping systems that include cotton have the potential to reduce overall irrigation demand on the Ogallala aquifer, potentially prolonging the life of the aquifer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Infectious cDNA clones of PRRSV make it possible to construct marker viruses for the study of virus replication and pathogenesis. The nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the single largest protein produced during virus replication. The cDNA of the pCMV-129 infectious PRRSV clone was modified by creating unique Mlu I and SgrA I restrictions sites at nucleotide (nt) positions 3,219 and 3,614, respectively: both located within the C-terminal region of nsp2.  cDNAs coding for oligo- and polypeptide tags, including FLAG, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase were inserted into the newly created restriction sites. The results showed that only the EGFP-containing genomes were properly expressed and produced virus. EGFP fluorescence, but not EGFP immunoreactivity, was lost during passage of recombinant EGFP viruses in culture. Sequencing of a fluorescence-negative EGFP virus showed that the EGFP remained intact, except for the appearance of mutations that may affect chromophore formation.  The results show that nsp2 can be a site for the expression of foreign proteins.&#xd;
     Removal of the region between Mlu I and SgrA I sites resulted in a virus that contained a 131 amino acid deletion. The deleted region was replaced with EGFP or an eight amino acid influenza hemagglutanin (HA) tag.  Recombinant viruses were used to infect pigs. Gross and micro-histopathology showed reduced pathogenesis when compared to the parent wild-type virus. The 131 amino acid peptide, when expressed as a recombinant protein and coated onto enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates, was recognized by sera from pigs infected with wild-type virus, but not the deletion mutants. The results from this study show that nsp2 is a potential target for the development of marker vaccines that can differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) and for virus attenuation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Soil chemical and physical properties beneath cattle feedlot pens are largely unstudied.  This project was conducted to survey select soil chemical and physical properties of soil beneath active open air cattle feedlots.  At four cattle feedlots in Kansas, the concentrations of NH4-N, organic-N, organic-C, Cl-, and P were high at the surface and rapidly decreased within 1.00 m.  At three of the four feedlots, NO3-N was generally below background concentration (4.1 mg kg-1) while one feedlot had a >75 mg kg-1 increase in the top 1.00 m.  Based on feeding data, only a small percent (7.9 to 1.2) of the total N deposited on the surface was found in the top 1.00 m below the pen surface for a range of 25 to 60 years of operation.  While in use, these feedlots do not appear to have a high potential for groundwater pollution from NO3-N leaching.  However, if they were to become inactive they may pose a severe threat to groundwater quality from organic-N mineralization and NH4-N nitrification.  If feedlots were closed and the land could be largely remediated by removing a layer of soil, these feedlots would have an average 48% profile N removed in a 0.25 m thick layer.  &#xd;
A chamber, a modified vacuum desiccator, was tested for the investigation of NH3 volatilization from soil in the laboratory.  Ammonia volatilization at the soil surface is dependent on air flow, soil and air temperatures, soil water content, pH, the concentrations of NH3 and NH4+ in the air and soil solution, and factors affecting soil temperature including humidity.  This chamber was built to control and/or quantify as many of these variables as possible.  A technique for quantifying and predicting NH3 volatilization is important because AFOs are one of the largest contributors of NH3 to the atmosphere, which can cause acid precipitation and particulate matter deposition downwind from the operation.  The chambers created allowed for repeated measurements with little error and appear to be a feasible, inexpensive apparatus to investigate NH3 volatilization mechanisms.  Using synthetic urine as an N source, NH3 volatilization was affected by initial soil moisture content and soil texture and may be affected by initial soil pH.  This chamber has promise to provide excellent data to assist the efforts being made to understand and model NH3 volatilization from feedlot pens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We have studied two critical binary liquid mixtures in the mixed phase regime with x-ray&#xd;
and neutron reflectometry to verify universal critical scaling at a non-critical interface. We&#xd;
compared our results with previous results obtained with ellipsometry.&#xd;
At a solid-liquid or liquid-vapor interface of an AB binary liquid mixture the component&#xd;
with the lower surface tension will dominate that interface. If the surface tension differential between the components of the mixture is large enough the composition of the&#xd;
surface layer will loose its dependence on. This case is referred to as strong adsorption.&#xd;
We study the case of strong adsorption for a binary liquid mixture at the critical composition&#xd;
with respect to the demixing phase transition. Sufficiently close to the critical&#xd;
temperature Tc the influence of bulk critical behavior is expected to dominate the way&#xd;
the surface adsorption layer decays with depth z from the surface composition to the bulk&#xd;
composition. The length scale of the decay profile is expected to be proportional to the composition&#xd;
correlation length, and is expected to scale with a universal composition scaling&#xd;
function.&#xd;
In a neutron reflectometry study of a critical mixture of D2O and 3-methylpyridine&#xd;
against a quartz substrate we verify universal critical scaling using a scaling function previously&#xd;
used to describe ellipsometry data. In an x-ray reflectometry study of the liquid-vapor&#xd;
interface of a critical mixture of n-dodecane and 1,1,2,2 tetrabromoethane, which had previously&#xd;
been studied with ellipsometry, we find that we are able to describe all data by&#xd;
using the same scaling function provided that we account for non-critical, system dependent&#xd;
surface structure as well. We are also able to simulate ellipsometry with our mathematical&#xd;
profile model and compare the simulation to the previous ellipsometry data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Variable N fertilizer application recommendations would benefit from crediting the N that will be mineralized and available to the crop during the growing season. During the 1994 and 1995 growing season, the spatial and temporal pattern of N mineralization was assessed on two central Kansas corn fields. Net N mineralization was measured in the field using a buried bag and a resin core method. A 60 m sampling grid was established on the field and the N mineralization was measured at each grid point. The field N mineralization measured was then compared to three lab incubation (14 day anaerobic incubation, CO₂ evolved 1 day after rewetting, and N released on autoclaving) measurements to determine if the field N mineralization could be predicted by a laboratory test. Nitrogen mineralization in the field was highest in May and declined during the growing seasons. Patches of high N mineralization appeared and disappeared during the season, areas of high and low mineralization were not found in the same areas month after month. The semivariance of the laboratory incubations tended to be smoother near the origin than the field incubations, indicating that the field incubations were subject to more sources of variability (such as microclimatic variations) than the laboratory incubations. &#xd;
Crop yields were not correlated with N mineralization in these fields. Soil moisture appeared to be more important to crop yields than the N contributed by mineralization. In these fields N mineralization does not need to be included in N fertilization recommendations unless the amount of fertilizer applied is much lower than in this study.&#xd;
Finally, a method to estimate the initial δ¹³ C content of a soil is proposed. This method can be used if a location can be found that has had a continuous C₃, a continuous C₄crop and a C₃/ C₄rotation treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Characterizing traffic-aware overlay topologies: a machine learning approach</dc:title>

<dc:description>Overlay networks are application-layer networks that are constructed using the existing Internet infrastructure. Nodes in an overlay network construct logical links toward other nodes to form an overlay topology. Common routing algorithms, such as the link state and distance vector algorithms, are then used to determine how to route data in the overlay network. Previous work has demonstrated that overlay networks can be used to improve routing performance in the Internet. These quality of service improvements make overlay&#xd;
networks attractive for a variety of network applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
Recently, game-theoretic approaches to constructing overlay network topologies have&#xd;
been proposed. In these approaches, nodes establish logical links toward other nodes in a decentralized and selﬁsh manner. Despite the selﬁsh behavior, it has been shown that desirable global network properties emerge. These approaches, however, neglect the traffic-demand between nodes. In this thesis, a game-theoretical approach is presented to constructing overlay network topologies that considers the traffic-demand between nodes. This thesis shows that the traffic-demand between nodes has a signiﬁcant effect on the topologies formed. Nodes with statistically higher traffic-demand from others become members of the graph center, while nodes that have statistically higher traffic-demand toward others establish logical links toward members of the graph center. This thesis also shows that a traffic-demand aware overlay network topology is better suited to transport the required traﬃc in the overlay network.&#xd;
&#xd;
Unfortunately, the game-theoretic approach is intractable. In order to construct larger&#xd;
overlay networks, approximate or heuristic approaches are required. In this thesis, a machine learning approach is proposed that characterizes the attributes of neighbor nodes during the construction of the overlay network topology. The approach proposed uses this knowledge and experience to learn a set of human-readable rules. This rule set is then used to decide whether to construct a logical link toward a node. This thesis shows that the machine learning approach results in similar overlay network topologies as the game-theoretic approach.&#xd;
Additionally, it is shown that the machine learning approach is tractable and scales to larger networks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The use of computer-based and personal assistive technology is projected to increase as the boomer generation continues to age. Technology is infiltrating and improving the lives of older adults, including their education. This study determined older adults’ preferences toward the use of technology to learn about nutrition and health. The sample included 132 volunteer subjects, mostly female, white non-Hispanic, ranging in age from 65−92 years, recruited from local organizations, senior centers, churches, and senior apartments. All participants completed a newly developed, 32-item pilot tested questionnaire that included demographic and self-rated health characteristics, current use of technology, factors that motivate and/or influence attitudes and interest toward use of technology, and preferred formats and topics of interest for nutrition and health education information. The results indicated that, overall, these older adults self-rated their health as either excellent or good, and that those who were younger and among the higher income brackets and education levels were more likely to use computers than those who were older, with less income, and education levels. Findings also indicated that older adults were interested and willing to learn about technology, had positive attitudes toward it and showed a high demand for user-friendly programs and training. Finally, results show that although newsletters, magazines and television were mostly preferred by older adults, computers were also considered very helpful and were used to learn about nutrition and health information.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The multidisciplinary quality of green roofs involves landscape architects, architects, structural engineers, horticulturalists, and increasingly ecologists in design and implementation.  A standard of measurement of green roof sustainability is necessary with increasing professional and public interest in green roofs and green roof impact on stormwater and urban ecology.  Currently, green roof LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) credits do not address the sustainability of green roofs.  The intent of this research is to take a critical look at green roof sustainability in regards to the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED green building standard credits.  It is also my intent to be (at least) a small, yet integral part in advancing the LEED standards and environmental standards as a whole. &#xd;
 &#xd;
Precedent studies, archival research and professional interviews provide a solid foundation for the development of green roof LEED credits to measure success and increase green roof sustainability.  Dialog with the USGBC and professionals provide a sound base for the development of the green roof criteria.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Today the HIV/AIDS epidemic is one of the many crises families may face. Many people have died of the disease while others are still living with it. At the end of 2003, an estimated 1,039,000 to 1,185,000 persons in the United States were living with HIV/AIDS, with 24-27% undiagnosed and unaware of their HIV infection. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that approximately 40,000 persons become infected with HIV each year (CDC, 2007). Stigmatization and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS is one of the many challenges that individuals and families affected by the disease face. They are unable to get employment, are denied health care, cannot access services in their communities and sometimes lose respect and power as a result of stigma. Stigma and discrimination also have been recognized as one of the main obstacles to HIV/AIDS, testing, prevention and treatment and yet little has been done to combat it. Stigma and discrimination is not only experienced by people living with HIV/AIDS but their family members, close friends, service providers and people that work with them also are stigmatized by association.&#xd;
This report highlights the need for family life educators to expand HIV educational programs to include issues on stigmatization and discrimination. It identifies some of the reasons why people stigmatize, the ways which stigma and discrimination are expressed and the impacts it has on individuals and their family members. Using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model of human development, this report identifies the need to look at HIV-related stigma and discrimination as a societal problem rather than individual problem, and presents implications for education programs for the general public.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Understanding irrigation water demand is vital to policy decisions concerning water scarcity.  This thesis evaluates irrigation water-use responses to changes in prices, while accounting for cross-sectional characteristics of irrigators’ resource settings.  An irrigator’s profit-maximizing decision is modeled in two stages.  In the first stage, he decides which crop to plant, and in the second stage he decides how much water to apply given the crop choice.&#xd;
This thesis employs an econometric modeling technique not previously used in the irrigation water demand literature, a multinomial logit selectivity model.  This econometric technique allows the intensive (change in water use for each crop in the short run) and extensive (change in water use in the long run due to changes in crop-choice) margin effects to be computed in a simultaneous equation system.  A multinomial logit selectivity model has applications to many resource issues in production agriculture where the two-stage decision process is common.  The model is estimated from field-level data on water use and crop-choice for a 25-county region in western Kansas over the period 1991-2004.&#xd;
Water use was found to be highly inelastic to the price of natural gas, but becomes more elastic as the price increases.  The intensive margin effect was significant for natural gas price.  The extensive margin effect only comprised half the total effect under high natural gas prices and was negligible for low prices.  However, the extensive margin effect under high natural gas prices declined over time due to more efficient irrigation systems and improved crop varieties.  The intensive margin effect explained most of the water use response from changes in other variables, including corn price.  An increase in corn price has a negligible extensive margin effect because corn is most often substituted with alfalfa, which has a similar water requirement.  &#xd;
Inelastic demand implies that policies aiming to conserve the Ogallala Aquifer by increasing the price of water will not accomplish their purpose and will affect irrigators’ incomes. More effective policies would be voluntary or mandatory quantity restrictions. However, efficient restrictions would need to account for spatial variation in the rate of depletion and the remaining saturated thickness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study is an integration of GIS, the Arc Hydro data model and tools, and&#xd;
hydrologic models to solve land use planning issues in the Little Kitten Creek&#xd;
watershed, Riley County, Kansas. Every day designers plan and design in watersheds.&#xd;
These designs alter the land use cover and change the hydrologic regime. Generally&#xd;
the design and development process does not consider upstream/downstream impacts&#xd;
on water quality and quantity. As a result development often increases flooding and&#xd;
water pollution.&#xd;
With the advent of the geodatabase, and the Arc Hydro geodatabase data model,&#xd;
designers have a flexible new tool for rapid simulation of a watershed. Arc Hydro allows&#xd;
the incorporation of traditional hydrologic data into linked modeling software together&#xd;
enabling users a “one-stop” approach for assimilating and modeling water resource&#xd;
systems. Once hydrologic data is in the Arc Hydro format it can be incorporated into&#xd;
assessment models, such as the Map to Map model.&#xd;
This case study assessed the floodplain analysis capabilities of the Map to Map&#xd;
model in the Little Kitten Creek (HUC 14) watershed. Steps to accomplish this goal&#xd;
were: data collection (digital and field surveys) and processing, geodatabase&#xd;
construction, linking the geodatabase with hydrologic modeling programs and, analysis&#xd;
of land uses within the watershed using the Map to Map model with the intent to&#xd;
produce flood maps based on land use changes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Perforated neutron detectors suffer the unfortunate effect that their efficiency is a strong function of the direction of neutron incidence. It is found, by Monte Carlo simulation of many perforation shapes, that sinusoidal-type perforations greatly reduce the variation of detector efficiency. Detectors with rod-type perforations are modeled using a hybrid transport&#xd;
method linking the MCNP transport code and a specialized ion-transport code to&#xd;
calculate the probability that a neutron is detected. Channel, chevron, and sinusoidal perforations&#xd;
are modeled using other customized transport codes. Detector efficiency calculations&#xd;
are performed for neutrons incident at various polar and azimuthal angles. It is discovered&#xd;
that the efficiency losses of the detectors result from the decreasing solid angle subtended&#xd;
by the detector from the source and streaming through the detector at specific azimuthal&#xd;
angles. Detectors achieving an efficiency in excess of 10% and having a relatively flat ± 1%&#xd;
angular dependence in all azimuthal angles and polar angles between 0 and 60 degrees are predicted. Efficiencies up to 25% are achievable at the loss of directional independence.&#xd;
&#xd;
In addition to minimizing the directional dependence of the perforated detectors, the&#xd;
feasibility of developing a neutron detector for deployment in cargo containers to locate&#xd;
nuclear weapon pits is investigated using the MCNP transport code. The detector considered&#xd;
is a 7-mm diameter, 6LiF, rod-perforated detector surrounded in a cylinder of polyethylene.&#xd;
The optimum thicknesses of surrounding polyethylene, to maximize the response of the&#xd;
detector, is determined to be 10 cm of radial, 5 cm of front, and 5 cm of back polyethylene&#xd;
for end-on neutron incidence. Such a detector is predicted to produce a count rate between 12&#xd;
and 15 cpm from a nuclear-weapon pit composed of 90% 239Pu and 10% 240Pu at a distance&#xd;
of 3 m. Side incidence is also considered, and the optimum moderator dimensions are 8 cm&#xd;
of radial, 10 cm of front, and 10 cm of back polyethylene that produce approximately the&#xd;
same count rate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Educators have realized that low-income students have a higher probability of lower&#xd;
achievement than students from a higher SES background and that these low-income students&#xd;
may very well continue into the cycle of poverty. The purpose of this study was to refine our&#xd;
understanding of the relationships between low-income student status and low income academic&#xd;
achievement in Kansas high schools. This study explored high school low income, low reading,&#xd;
low mathematics, low science achievement correlations among three metropolitan locations and&#xd;
four sizes of high schools. The dependent variables were the school building rates of low income&#xd;
and the school building rates of low achievement. The independent variables were school&#xd;
location and school size. The data was retrieved from the Kansas State Board of Education&#xd;
website. The three metropolitan areas studied were the Wichita, the Topeka-Lawrence and the&#xd;
Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Areas. The four sizes of high schools studied were the 6A-,&#xd;
5A-, 4A-, and 3A-sized high schools. There were seven research questions in this study. All the&#xd;
research questions were non-directional except for research question #2. Correlation coefficients,&#xd;
standard deviation scores, range scores, frequency scores, intercorrelations, coefficient of&#xd;
determinations, partial correlations and ANCOVA scores were used to analyze the data.&#xd;
The major conclusions for each research questions were: (1) the unsatisfactory + basic&#xd;
scores of all three low achievement areas (reading, mathematics and science) were the most&#xd;
consistent representation of low achievement. (2) in the three metropolitan areas, where income&#xd;
differences were greater, low income and low achievement correlations were greater. Where&#xd;
income differences were smaller, low income and low achievement correlations were smaller. (3)&#xd;
smaller schools did not have the better school results. (4) the low reading, mathematics and&#xd;
science correlations had different magnitudes depending on the group. Either low mathematics or&#xd;
low science achievement produced the largest correlations with low income in all seven groups.&#xd;
(5) the smaller standard deviation and range scores may have contributed to the smaller&#xd;
correlations in metropolitan area 2 and the 4A-sized high schools. Findings in the frequency&#xd;
distributions have reinforced the standard deviation and range results. (6) low mathematics and&#xd;
low science achievement were as important as low reading achievement. (7) the lowachievement&#xd;
rates (adjusted for low-income rates) did not differ much across the subject areas&#xd;
when the seven subgroups were considered. The idea of building smaller schools was not&#xd;
supported by the findings.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the study was to determine the reading methods New Mexico teachers considered important to use in their classrooms and schools. Design of the study was based on a fixed goals COBRA (content-based reading approach) model, which is in development by Heerman (2002).  The New Mexico COBRA model was revised to fit the socio-cultural context of the diverse student population served by middle schools in the state.    &#xd;
Teachers in New Mexico were asked to respond to a reading survey built around 44 reading methods distributed among seven goals of the COBRA model.  The researcher surveyed 153 New Mexico middle school educators in 110 middle school building in order to determine the relative emphasis placed on various reading methods. A revision of the original survey used by Al-Fadda was conducted, which included drafting ELL survey items used at the middle schools with reference to culturally and linguistically diverse students or ELLs.&#xd;
Five research questions were used to build the rationale for the COBRA framework, develop the survey, conduct the survey research, and analyze the results. Middle schools included in this survey research were characterized as middle schools with a student population of 200 and above. The pool of educators asked to participate in the survey taught or were involved with the reading program at their respective schools.  These included reading teachers, English language arts teachers, Bilingual/ESL/TESOL teachers, and instructional and school improvement leaders familiar with the building’s reading program. &#xd;
These middle level teachers perceive as important a first line conventional framework for middle level reading, which includes skills instruction, narrative literature instruction, and writing.  These teachers give first emphases to reading instruction and communicative competence while content reading instruction is a secondary emphasis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Antibiotics and pharmaceuticals are used to improve the quality of life worldwide. However, incomplete metabolism in humans has resulted in the release of large amounts of pharmaceutical drugs into municipal wastewater treatment plant. Past research has shown the release of antibiotic resistant organisms through wastewater effluents into streams and several studies have reported the occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in major U.S. Rivers. Antibiotic resistant bacteria evolve and are selected by long-term environmental exposure to the low concentrations of antibiotics at the ng /L to  g/L range.  Infections caused by antibiotic resistant organisms are difficult to treat. The aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic resistance patterns in selected wastewater bacteria that include fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci. Microorganisms in municipal wastewater treatment plant influent, secondary clarifier effluent and disinfected effluent were plated in the presence of predetermined concentrations of selected antibiotics. These antibiotics included ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim and vancomycin. The diversity of enterococci was further investigated with PCR analysis. Fecal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci were found to be resistant or highly resistant to one or more target antibiotics in the influent and secondary clarifier (SC) effluent.  Biological treatment reduced the number of overall and resistant bacteria in the SC effluent sample. UV disinfection was generally very effective and eliminated all fecal indicator organisms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation has focused primarily on the relationship between aggregate private output and a measure of the public fixed capital stock for the U.S. economy using two different approaches for the years 1947-2005.  The study starts with a brief survey of the existing literature on the relationship between private output and public capital and continues with an analysis of data on some macroeconomic variables related to private output and public capital.  It employs a production function approach to provide empirical estimates and analyze its econometric problems, and continues with a vector autoregression (VAR) model.  It uses two criteria, the Akaike Information Criterion and the Schwartz Bayesian Criterion, to compare the performance of the two models tested.  &#xd;
There are several differences between this study and the existing literature.  The most important difference is that each of the other studies uses only a single approach to analyze the relationship between the public capital stock and private economic growth while this study uses two different methodologies to analyze the same relationship and tests the two models using the same aggregate macroeconomic annual data on the U.S. economy from 1947 to 2005.  This study represents the first attempt to provide estimates of the elasticities of private output with respect to the private capital stock, private labor stock, public nonmilitary capital stock, and public core infrastructure capital stock by employing two different approaches so that the comparison of the elasticities resulting from the two different approaches can be most meaningful.  Moreover, this study also represents the first attempt to provide estimates of the marginal products of the above four inputs.  Second, the studies that employ a production function approach are ad hoc and so is the production function approach of this study, but the production function approach section of this study is the only one having an explicit capital evolution equation for both the private and the public capital stock.  All of the other studies using annual data use aggregate macroeconomic data on related variables for less than thirty years while this study employs aggregate data from 1947 to 2005 (fifty nine years).  Lastly, the other production function studies are incomplete in the sense that they either do not attempt to deal with some major econometric problems such as a common trend (resulting in a spurious correlation) and the direction of the causation or when they do acknowledge major econometric problems, they do not do anything to correct them.  This study, on the other hand, will try to detect major econometric problems.  Once the problem is detected, the study will employ measures to deal with the problem.&#xd;
	Major findings of this study are as follows.  First, the causation runs from the public fixed capital stock to private output rather than in the other direction.  Second, most of the studies in the existing literature report a positive impact of the private fixed capital stock on private output that is too small to be credible, whereas they report a positive impact of the public fixed capital stock on private output that is too large to be credible.  However, the estimates of this study suggest not only a positive impact of the public capital stock on private output that seems credible but also a positive and very large impact of the private capital stock on private output.  Third, the results of several joint hypothesis tests conducted show that there is enough sample evidence to claim that not only that the private sector operates under constant returns to scale in all inputs, private and public, for the years 1947-2005 but also that the private fixed capital stock is more important to the aggregate private production process than either of the two measures of the public fixed capital stock.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When compared to adult mothers, adolescent mothers are more prone to parenting challenges (Whitman et al., 2001). Age is considered influential on a mother’s belief in her ability to successfully organize and execute her parenting plan (Bandura, 1999).&#xd;
The purpose of this study was to examine potential predictors of self-efficacy (determinant of parenting) among first-time mothers applying Belsky’s (1984) parenting framework. Maternal age, maternal depression, available social support and infant temperament were all considered to be potential predictors of maternal self-efficacy.&#xd;
A sample of first-time mothers (N = 115) with no other children in the home with an infant between the ages of four and six months was recruited from local alternative high schools, home and center child care facilities, and various other social services agencies and programs that typically serve new mothers. Participants self-reported on the above variables by completing a survey measuring self-efficacy as well as the hypothesized predictors. Responses were analyzed using group mean comparisons between 3 age groups: mothers 19 years and under (23%); mothers 20-26 years of age (29%); and mothers 26 years of age and older (48%).&#xd;
No significant differences in self-efficacy, perceived infant temperament, social support were found between age groups. Age differences in maternal depression fell just below significance. Maternal income level was significantly (and negatively) correlated with maternal depression, therefore was controlled for in additional analyses.&#xd;
Annual income, depression, and self efficacy were significantly correlated to perceived infant temperament. Mothers with lower incomes, who perceived less social support, who reported higher levels of depression, or had lower levels of self-efficacy were found to rate their infants as more temperamentally difficult.&#xd;
Regression analyses demonstrated that level of perceived social support significantly predicted maternal self-efficacy levels across all age groups. Additionally, infant temperament and maternal depression levels predicted self-efficacy. These findings provide evidence to support the importance of equal accessibility and affordability of social support for all new mothers to assist with the positive transition to parenthood.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Material formulation and extrusion process parameters affect the foaming process in terms of expansion, cell nucleation, and resultant foam microstructure, which, in turn, control mechanical properties.  This study utilizes non-invasive x-ray microtomography (XMT), in combination with mechanical testing and novel phase transition analysis techniques, to understand these complex relationships.  The first part of this study provided significant insight into the deformation mechanism of extruded cornstarch foams.  Microstructure features, including average cell diameter (2.07-6.32 mm), wall thickness (0.13-0.25 mm) and number density (18-146 cm-3), were measured.  Microstructure had moderate to high correlations (|r| = 0.48 - 0.81) with mechanical properties, including compression modulus (2.2-7.8 MPa), crushing stress (42-240 kPa), number of spatial ruptures (2.6-3.6 mm-1), average crushing force (22-67 N) and crispness work (6.4-22 N-mm). The second part of this study investigated the effects of formulation, using model systems comprising of cornstarch, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sucrose, on phase transition behavior, and physical, microstructure and mechanical properties of extrudates.  Increase in WPI led to greater specific mechanical energy (SME) and higher extrudate expansion.  WPI had a foaming effect, which increased the cell number density accompanied by decrease in average cell diameter.  Increase in sucrose led to lesser SME and lower expansion of extrudates.  Contrary to expectations, phase transition properties (softening temperature, Ts, and flow temperature, Tf) were not good indicators of SME.  The concluding part of this study investigated glass transition and rheological properties of cornstarch at different moisture contents (18-30% wet basis) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), phase transition analysis (PTA) and on-line slit-die rheometry. Glass transition temperature (Tg) (31.20 - 57.55 C) of extrudates decreased as moisture content increased.  Ts (42.5 - 85.6C) and Tf  (109 - 136C) also followed the same trend, and exhibited high correlations (r = 0.89 and 0.86, respectively) with Tg.  These parameters were good estimates of phase transition properties of the complex and heterogeneous formulations.  As expected, on-line rheological parameters, including flow behavior index, n (0.0438 - 0.304) and consistency coefficient, K (10,500 - 45,700 Pa-sn-1), were functions of in-barrel moisture, and were related to phase transition properties using WLF kinetics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Wheat lignans are phenylpropane dimers linked by β-β bonds with a 1, 4-diarylbutane structure.   They are biosynthesized in the cell cytoplasm through action of enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase (PLR) catalyzes the final steps of biosynthesis of wheat lignans. In epidemiological and clinical investigations, studies show that high plasma lignan amounts correlate with reduced risks of breast, colon, and prostate cancers. However, in some of the studies, the results are not consistent. More consistent results are observed when animal and cell culture models are used. Our previous studies in the Wang lab demonstrated that treatment of human colon cancer cells, SW480 with lignans results in a dose and time dependent inhibition of cancer cell growth.  In the first paper, we investigated direct experimental cancer preventative characteristics of a wheat lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) vs. its metabolite enterolactone in human colon cancer SW480 cells. Treatment of cancer cells with 0-40 µM SDG or enterolactone resulted into inhibition of cancer cell growth as observed by reduction of cell numbers. The reduction appeared related to induction of S-phase cell cycle arrest rather than cytotoxic effect. Further analysis revealed that SDG was more stable in cell culture medium than enterolactone. HPLC-MS/ESI showed that enterolactone is the principle metabolite in cancer cells but undetectable SDG or its metabolites were in the cells treated with SDG. In the second paper, we investigated over expression of the PLR gene and enhancement of lignan levels in transgenic wheat. We transformed wheat cultivars (‘Bobwhite’, ‘Madison’, and ‘Fielder’ respectively) with the Forsythia intermedia PLR gene under the regulatory control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. Of the total 217 transgenic wheat lines, we successfully obtained 7 transformants with the inserted ubiquitin PLR gene as screened by PCR. Real-time PCR further indicated 109-117% PLR over expression over the transgenic control in 3 transformants of the 7 at T0 generation. In addition, the levels of SDG, as determined by HPLC was found to be significantly elevated in one of the 3 positive transgenic plants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reported that genetically engineered wheat with over expressed PLR enzyme enhancing phytochemical lignan has been successfully achieved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Events of war have long been considered traumatic and research has found that those exposed to war may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or psychological difficulties. Although research has indicated the instance of increased PTSD and other symptoms in returning Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) soldiers, it has yet to explore the trauma experiences of their female partners. The current study sought to address this limitation by exploring the ways in which&#xd;
partners’/wives’ primary trauma influenced the marriage relationship. Given the tendency&#xd;
for trauma to negatively influence relationship satisfaction, it was expected that the primary trauma experiences of the female partners of OIF/OEF soldiers would likewise negatively impact relationship satisfaction for both themselves and the soldiers. &#xd;
     Results from this study indicated that female primary trauma, particularly trauma related to PTSD symptoms, has an influence on levels of relationship satisfaction, both for female partners and soldiers. Specifically, female partner re-experiencing symptoms were found to most significantly predict their own relationship satisfaction, while female partner arousal symptoms most significantly predicted soldier relationship satisfaction. &#xd;
     Understanding female primary trauma may be important given the seeming sensitivity females have for developing PTSD and for experiencing symptoms that are chronic in nature. In addition, female civilian partners may play a key role in helping military families to function well throughout the deployment process given their assumption of major family responsibilities. Further, their emotional wellbeing may be considered a “family affair” due to the role that family relationships may serve in helping individuals cope with trauma, including returning soldiers. Indeed, civilian female partners appear to play a major role in helping military families cope with stresses associated with war and the deployment process. As such, the emotional condition of military families can no longer be considered solely within the realm of soldier trauma or secondary traumatization, but instead include consideration of the influence of female primary traumatic experiences.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Monte Carlo model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of different biosecurity strategies for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) on cow-calf farms.  Where possible, risk distributions were defined in the course of a critical literature review covering all publications since 1990 relevant to BVDV on cow-calf farms.  The prevalence of persistent infections (PIs) in adult cows was unknown, so a survey of viremia in 2,990 adult cows for sale in the Midwest during 2006 was performed; prevalence was calculated to be 0.07%.  In order to validate a newly developed RT-nPCR for pooled serum used for the survey, sensitivity was determined based on 100 known viremic serum samples; sensitivity was 95%, with no detectable effect of strain type.&#xd;
A Monte Carlo model was developed to calculate the risk of introducing BVDV to a cow-calf herd and number of PIs introduced in one year, based on herd imports and biosecurity strategies.  The results of that model were integrated with a stochastic SIR model for the spread and impact of BVDV through a cow-calf herd over 10 years, based on herd size and control strategies.  The resulting model was integrated with a stochastic model for the cost of both the biosecurity and control measures used and the financial impact of BVDV infection on the herd over 10 years.  The lowest risk option of 14 biosecurity strategies were calculated for 400-, 100-, and 50-head herds with 8 different import profiles, and management factors that increase financial risk due to BVDV were determined.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Expansion of dough and hence breadmaking performance is postulated to depend on a dual mechanism for stabilization of inflating gas bubbles. Two flours were used in this study, one from the wheat variety Jagger (Jagger) and the other from a composite of soft wheat varieties (soft). The primary stabilizing mechanism is due to the gluten-starch matrix surrounding the bubble. The secondary mechanism operates when gas bubbles come into close contact during later proofing and early baking. When discontinuities occur in the gluten-starch matrix surrounding gas bubbles, thin liquid lamellae stabilized by adsorbed surface active compounds, provide a secondary stabilization.&#xd;
&#xd;
A key parameter in the primary stabilizing dough film is thought to be the property of strain hardening. Jagger flour gave higher test-bake loaf volume than soft wheat flour and higher strain hardening index for dough. Rheological properties of doughs were varied by addition of protein fractions prepared by pH fractionation. Fractions were characterized by SE-HPLC and MALLS. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of fractions progressively shifted to higher values as the pH of fractionations decreased. Mixograph peak development time paralleled the MWD. However, the strain hardening index and the test-bake loaf volume increased with increasing MWD up to a point (optimum), after which they declined. At a given strain rate the behavior at the optimum appeared to result from slippage of the maximum number of statistical segments between entanglements, without disrupting the entangled network of polymeric proteins. Shift of MWD to MW higher than the optimum results in a stronger network with reduced slippage through entanglement nodes, whereas a shift to lower MWs will decrease the strength of the network due to less number of entanglements per chain.&#xd;
&#xd;
In order to study the secondary stabilizing mechanism, different lipid fractions were added incrementally to the defatted flours. No effects were observed on the rheological properties of the dough. However, large effects on the loaf volume were measured. The additives used were the total flour lipid and its polar and non polar fractions and the fatty acids palmitic, linoleic and myristic. Polar lipids and palmitic acid had positive or little effect on loaf volume respectively. Non polar lipid, linoleic and myristic acids had negative effects on loaf volume. 1&#xd;
The different effects of the lipid fractions are thought to be related to the type of monolayer that is formed. Polar lipid and palmitic acid form condensed monolayers at the air/water interface whereas non polar lipid, linoleic and myristic acids form expanded monolayers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine what social factors influenced ninth-grade students asked to participate in dramatic oral reading activities in the context of their high school English classroom. Participatory action research was completed in cooperation with a classroom teacher and his student teacher. A grounded theory design advised the transcription, coding, and data analysis of the study.&#xd;
&#xd;
In 2006, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Foundation formed Poetry Out Loud, a National Recitation Contest where high school students around the country recited poetry in a contest form. This study used materials and some curriculum from Poetry Out Loud, but rather than memorizing and reciting the poems, the students were asked to perform dramatic oral readings of them. This focus on reading stemmed, in part, from studies completed by&#xd;
Rasinski (2005) claiming ninth-grade students still lacked fluency in their reading in addition to work in the areas of Automaticity (LaBerge &amp; Samuels, 1974) and Prosody (Schreiber, 1991). These students participated in six weeks of activities designed to build skill in dramatic oral reading. Field notes were taken throughout the project. Performances were recorded using video and audio devices, student interviews were recorded and transcribed, and teacher interviews were&#xd;
recorded and transcribed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Data revealed fourteen categories during the open coding stage that contributed, through axial coding, to three different themes: family versus dysfunctional family, positive performance conditions versus adverse performance conditions, and literate identity versus anti-literate identity. These three themes and each respective antithesis were progressively contingent on each other when laid out in a lateral manner with the results of the project being that students either developed a literate identity when the conditions were in place or developed a decidedly anti-literate identity. This theory, grounded entirely in data collected during the study, provided an understanding of the social context at play in this classroom. This study provided qualitative insight necessary for continuing to explore dramatic oral reading fluency at the high school level by revealing the importance of community in asking students to perform in front of their peers, a&#xd;
potentially socially jeopardizing situation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Glycerolipids are the most abundant lipids and are important constituents of various virulence factors in the protozoan parasite Leishmania. The dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase LmDAT catalyzes the first step of the ether, and possibly ester glycerolipid biosynthetic pathway. A L. major null mutant of LmDAT grew slowly, died rapidly during the stationary phase of growth, and more importantly, was attenuated in virulence in mice. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular basis responsible for the attenuated virulence. Western blot analysis revealed that the ∆lmdat/∆lmdat null mutant synthesized altered versions of the virulence factor lipophosphoglycans that were not released in the media, suggesting that its lipid anchor structure was altered. The ∆lmdat/∆lmdat strain differentiated into virulent metacyclics, but with lower efficiency compared to the wild type. Using the autophagosomal marker ATG8-GFP, the ∆lmdat/∆lmdat line produced twice as many autophagosomes as the wild type, suggesting that it is either defective in degradation of autophagosomes or that autophagy is simply induced. In conclusion, the attenuated virulence of ∆lmdat/∆lmdat may be explained by i) its inability to synthesize and release normal forms of lipophosphoglycan, ii) its inability to fully differentiate into virulent metacyclics, and iii) altered autophagy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Most rangelands are harvested at some point during the year and removal of plant leaf area and biomass alters a host of ecosystem processes including gas exchange. An experiment was conducted in 2005 and 2006 to study the effects of&#xd;
clipping tallgrass prairie at different dates on water vapor and CO2 fluxes. A portable,&#xd;
non-steady-state chamber was designed to measure CO2 and water vapor fluxes from&#xd;
small plots in less than 40 s. A combination of sunlit and shaded readings allowed&#xd;
measurements of net carbon exchange (NCE) and ecosystem respiration (RE); by summing NCE and RE, gross canopy photosynthesis (GCP) was calculated.  Throughout the two-year study, the chamber had a minimal effect on microclimate, i.e.,&#xd;
average chamber temperature increased 2.9° C, while chamber pressure increased&#xd;
only 0.3 Pa during measurements, and photosynthetically active radiation attenuation was 10%. The immediate effect of all clipping treatments was a loss of leaf area that led to reductions in GCP, NCE, and RE and in most cases decreased water vapor flux.  Further patterns of carbon flux were governed by the amount of water stress during&#xd;
canopy development, while water vapor flux rates varied with water availability.&#xd;
Canopies that developed during periods of low water stress quickly increased carbon&#xd;
flux rates following precipitation after a mid-season drought. However, flux rates of&#xd;
canopies, which developed during the mid-season drought, responded considerably&#xd;
slower to subsequent water availability. A separate experiment was conducted from&#xd;
June-October of 2006 to estimate GCP, leaf area index (LAI), and total aboveground&#xd;
biomass with a hyperspectral radiometer. Indices such as the Normalized Difference&#xd;
Vegetation Index and the Simple Ratio were used to estimate LAI and biomass had&#xd;
poor correlations with measured values. However, GCP was significantly correlated to&#xd;
all six indices derived in this study. While GCP measured from June-October was&#xd;
significantly correlated with all indices, removal of the senesced canopy scans recorded&#xd;
during October greatly increased the relationship.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Biosecurity, biocontainment and security practices are important in production animal agriculture. Procuring cattle from multiple sources and commingling them into a single confinement operation increases risk of disease introduction. The large concentration of animals makes a feedyard a more likely target of a domestic or international terror group. Controlling or eradicating an intentionally introduced pathogen or toxin would be costly. The aim of these surveys was to gather information from experts about perceived risks and mitigation strategies and to assess current practices of biosecurity, biocontainment and security in Central Plains feedyards. Consulting veterinarians and feedyard managers shared similar views on the likelihood of disease caused by terrorism, natural introduction or accidental introduction, and on the importance of on-site security. They disagreed on the importance of preventative products, disease transmission control, and environmental control. Generally speaking, feedyard managers believed environmental control to be more important than consulting veterinarians. In reference to a survey of current practices, some feedyards use equipment for both manure and feed handling. Many feedyards are not cleaning and disinfecting oral treatment equipment, treatment facilities, or unloading facilities on a regular basis which may increases their risk for indirect disease transmission of endemic agents such as Salmonella or BVDV. Most feedyards in this survey import some cattle directly from an auction market, do not require clean boots or foot covering to be worn by visitors, and do not require trailers to be cleaned. Smaller feedyards were more likely to require trailers to be cleaned before loading incoming cattle. Less than half of the feedyards reported having a fence that will stop humans or kept protein supplements or micro-nutrients secured from access. Some feedyards enforced a visitor log or employed a night watchman. Most feedyards learned about a future employee by calling references listed in resume, but some performed a criminal background check. A cost-benefit analysis should be done on all management practices to determine economic benefits. More research is needed to better understand which practices are most beneficial.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Current practices in software development heavily emphasize the development of reusable&#xd;
and modular software, which allow software components to be developed and maintained independently.&#xd;
While a component-oriented approach offers a number of benefits, it presents several&#xd;
quality assurance challenges including validating the correctness of individual components as well&#xd;
as their integration. Design-by-contract (DBC) offers a promising solution that emphasizes precisely&#xd;
defined and checkable interface specifications for software components. However, existing&#xd;
tools for the DBC paradigm often have some weaknesses: (1) they have difficulty in dealing with&#xd;
dynamically allocated data; (2) specification and checking efforts are disconnected from quality&#xd;
assurance tools; and (3) user feedback is quite poor.&#xd;
We present Kiasan, a framework that synergistically combines a number of automated reasoning&#xd;
techniques including symbolic execution, model checking, theorem proving, and constraint&#xd;
solving to support design-by-contract reasoning of object-oriented programs written in languages&#xd;
such as Java and C#. Compared to existing approaches to Java contract verification, Kiasan can&#xd;
check much stronger behavioral properties of object-oriented software including properties that&#xd;
make extensive use of heap-allocated data and provide stronger coverage guarantees. In addition,&#xd;
Kiasan naturally generates counter examples illustrating contract violations, visualization of code&#xd;
effects, and JUnit test cases that are driven by code and user-supplied specifications. Coverage/-&#xd;
cost trade-offs are controlled by user-specified bounds on the length of heap-reference chains and&#xd;
number of loop iterations. Kiasan’s unit test case generation facilities compare very favorably&#xd;
with similar tools. Finally, in contrast to other approaches based on symbolic execution, Kiasan&#xd;
has a rigorous foundation: we have shown that Kiasan is relatively sound and complete and the&#xd;
test case generation algorithm is sound.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the STAR-LM (Secure Transportable Autonomous Reactor-Liquid Metal) reactor concept developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), a supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) Brayton cycle is used as the power conversion system because it features advantages such as a higher efficiency due to less compressive work, and competitive cost due to a reduced complexity and size. From the components of the cycle, high performance of both the recuperator and precooler has a large influence on the overall cycle efficiency and plant economy. One attractive option for optimizing the performance of the cycle is to use an high efficiency heat exchanger such as the Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger (PCHE) manufactured by Heatric. The PCHE is a compact heat exchanger with high effectiveness, wide operating range, enhanced safety, and low cost. PCHEs are used in various industrial applications, but are relatively new to the nuclear industry.&#xd;
In this study, performance testing of a PCHE using supercritical CO2 and water as heat transfer media were performed at ANL. The heat transfer characteristics of the PCHE under operating conditions of the STAR_LM precooler were investigated. The S-CO2 , defined the “hot-side”, had its outlet condition near the pseudocritical point at 7.5MPa (~31-32 C). We found that of all the thermophysical properties undergoing rapid change near the critical point, heat transfer for S-CO2 is strongly correlated with the specific heat of CO2. Additional experiments performed with different bulk temperatures and pressures on the hot side also supported this conclusion. We proposed plotting the heat transfer results, (Nu2 + Pr2/3) versus (RePr4/3), based on an order-of-magnitude analysis, to reveal the close proximity of the outlet to pseudocritical conditions.&#xd;
In order to check the experimental results, a nodal model of a segmented PCHE using a traditional log-mean temperature difference method was developed. This approach provided the temperature distribution along the heat exchanger. Additionally a CFD simulation (FLUENT) of a 4-layer, zig-zag channeled PCHE was developed. Comparison of the simulation and LMTD nodal model revealed that indeed specific heat strongly influenced the heat transfer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated the strengths and weaknesses of the McNair program at the three Kansas Regents institutions.  The population included 259 former McNair program participants from Kansas State University (KSU), the University of Kansas (KU), and Wichita State University (WSU) who graduated with baccalaureate degrees between 1996 and 2004.  These alumni were asked to complete a two- part survey.  Part one collected data on McNair alumni perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the program on a thirty-three item, five-point Likert scale.  Additionally, part one collected data on McNair alumni recommendations regarding the amount of emphasis that should be placed on program services and activities.  Next, part two collected selected demographics.  This provided useful data to examine how selected demographics relate to program perceptions.&#xd;
One hundred and thirty-seven of the 259 McNair alumni completed the survey.  Overall, the results of the data suggested that they perceived the services and activities to be more of a strength than a weakness.  Also, the recorded comments by the alumni indicated that their experiences as McNair scholars were positive.&#xd;
McNair scholar alumni recommended providing more assistance with how to interview prospective faculty mentors, obtain financial assistance, and stay abreast of resources that would increase the number of McNair scholars enrolling in graduate school and completing a graduate degree.&#xd;
Further study is recommended to survey McNair alumni who have completed doctoral degrees regarding the need for services that would help strengthen areas that were perceived to be weaker than others.  These areas include “Enrollment in a Graduate School Program Leading to a Doctorate Degree” and “Selecting and Working With a Faculty Mentor”.  Additionally, further study is recommended to investigate how alumni differ in their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the McNair Program by major field of study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work is the result of a wide range of computer simulation research into the&#xd;
aggregation behavior of dispersed colloidal and aerosol particles in a number of different&#xd;
environments from the continuum to the free-molecular. The goal of this research has&#xd;
been to provide a bridge between experimental and theoretical researchers in this field by&#xd;
simulating the aggregation process within a known model. To this end, a variety of interparticle&#xd;
interactions has been studied in the course of this research, focusing on the effect&#xd;
of these interactions on the aggregation mechanism and resulting aggregate structures.&#xd;
Both Monte Carlo and Brownian Dynamics codes have been used to achieve this goal.&#xd;
The morphologies of clusters that result from aggregation events in these systems have&#xd;
been thoroughly analyzed with a range of diverse techniques, and excellent agreement&#xd;
has been found with other researchers in this field. Morphologies of these clusters&#xd;
include fractal, gel, and crystalline forms, sometimes within the same structure at&#xd;
different length scales. This research has contributed to the fundamental understanding of&#xd;

<dc:description>With the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (PL 107-110) many pedagogical practices for literacy learning have been re-examined to align themselves with the results of the National Reading Panel report (2000).  The federally funded Reading First initiative mandates systematic and explicit instruction of the key components identified by the National Reading Panel report (phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension). Higher accountability and high stakes testing has caused reflection regarding how instructional time is spent in classrooms.   &#xd;
This qualitative case study was conducted in a combined setting of a kindergarten classroom and music education classroom in a small mid-western community over a period of nine weeks, from February 15 through April 23, 2007.  This study, framed in the socio-cultural theory of constructivism (Vygotsky, 1978) and Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligence (2004) explored the way a kindergarten teacher and music educator provided literacy learning opportunities for young children.   Data were collected through detailed observational fieldnotes, interviews of the kindergarten teacher and music educator, and conversations with children. Data analysis revealed five characteristics that framed the literacy learning environment which included: 1) providing a caring community; 2) use of conversations; 3) connections to prior knowledge and community; 4) collaboration; and 5) consistency.  &#xd;
Pedagogical commonalities were found to include: 1) a gradual release of responsibility; 2) use of metacognition; 3) a sharing of quality children’s literature; 4) purposeful oral language development; and 5) use of active engagement in learning, especially the use of gesturing.  Data also revealed evidence of support of six components of early literacy learning: 1) phonemic awareness; 2) phonics; 3) fluency; 4) vocabulary; 5) comprehension; and 6) concepts about print.  Data identified that the classroom teacher provided more incidences of instruction coded as phonemic awareness, phonics, and comprehension; with the classroom music educator providing more evidence of coded events for fluency and vocabulary learning.  Analysis of combined events identified a balance of instructional methods, experiences, and techniques identifying the critical importance of the elementary music educator’s role in supporting early literacy learning of young children and the importance of collaboration in meeting needs of children.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A series of teaching activities using physical models was developed to present some portions of physics of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and investigate students’ understanding and transfer of learning in physics to a medical technology. A teaching interview protocol consistent with a qualitative research methodology was developed and administered to the students enrolled in an algebra-based introductory level physics course. 16 students participated in individual interviews and another 21 students participated in the group sessions. The major objectives of the teaching interviews were to investigate students’ transfer of physics learning from their prior experiences to the provided physical models, from one model to the other and from the models to the PET problems. &#xd;
The study adapted phenomenological research methodology in analyzing students’ use of cognitive resources and cognitive strategies during knowledge construction and reconstruction. A resource based transfer model framed under the cognitive theory of learning and consistent with contemporary views of transfer was used to describe the transfer of physics learning.&#xd;
Results of the study indicated both appropriate and inappropriate use of the students’ prior conceptual resources in novel contexts. Scaffolding and questioning were found to be effective in activating appropriate and suppressing the inappropriate resources. The physical models used as analogies were found useful in transferring physics learning to understand image construction in PET. Positive transfer was possible when the models were introduced in an appropriate sequence. The results of the study indicate the occurrence of three types of non-scaffolded transfer – spontaneous, semi spontaneous and non-spontaneous. The research found connections between sequencing of hints and phrasing of information in activating students’ different conceptual resources. A qualitative investigation based on Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) has been completed in two contexts – one involving an instructor and the other involving peers. Significant expansion of the students’ ZPD occurred through peer interaction. &#xd;
The results indicate that the appropriate sequencing of learning activities and group interactions can promote learning. Additional research in transfer of physics learning from macroscopic phenomena to microscopic phenomena are warranted by the conclusions of this work.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In today’s classrooms, literacy instruction is undergoing tremendous transformations as new technologies demand new literacies.  The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine how integration of technology supports the emergence of new literacies, within the context of an electronic reading workshop in a fifth-grade classroom.  &#xd;
The electronic reading workshop provided students multiple opportunities to response to e-books, both as readers and technology users.   First, e-book tools allowed the participants to engage in a spontaneous response process as the plot unfolded.  Second, students responded to teacher-constructed prompts in electronic literature response journals.  Analysis of the journals revealed responses from three broad categories: 1) personal meaning making, 2) character and plot involvement, and 3) literary criticism.  &#xd;
Third, students engaged in conversational response while participating in asynchronous message board discussions.  The students composed and posted their own response prompts.  Analysis of the message board transcripts suggested five types of student-constructed prompts: 1) experiential prompts, 2) aesthetic prompts 3) cognitive prompts, 4) interpretive prompts, and 5) clarification prompts.    &#xd;
Virtual guide response projects provided a fourth opportunity for response to e-books. Working in groups, students created virtual guides to the literature in which they visually represented their personal interpretations of the e-books.  The virtual guides were published as multi-modal PowerPoint presentations including sounds, images, animations, and hyperlinks.  As students conceptualized, researched, published and presented their virtual guides to the literature, they used new literacies to fully exploit the potential of the available technologies.  &#xd;
The electronic reading workshop provided a learning environment in which students interacted with each other as they made sense of and accessed the available information and communication technologies.   In particular, socially constructed learning occurred through threaded discussions on an electronic message board and development of virtual guide response projects.  &#xd;
Educators must be responsive to today’s learners.  This study illuminated the expanded possibilities for integrating technology and literacy within the context of an electronic reading workshop. Findings of the study suggest technology integration supports the emergence of new literacies, while the new literacies support students’ utilization of available technologies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this qualitative collective case study was to examine the sociocultural and gender role expectation factors that contributed to the success of 10 Latina/Hispanic female high school graduates now attending a large university in the Midwest. Additionally, the study investigated the characteristics of resilience and persistence that helped these women continue their pursuit of higher education in spite of the challenges they faced. The participants in this study were identified as recent immigrants from Mexico or Mexican-Americans born in the United States of Mexican immigrant parents. All of these respondents graduated from a midwestern K-12 public school system and are now attending a large Midwestern university.&#xd;
	This study used a qualitative paradigm and open-ended, in-depth interviews for data collection. The 17 question interview focused on the areas of sociocultural backgrounds, resilience/persistence factors, and gender role expectations. Demographic data about the participants’ life histories and educational experiences were collected during the 90-minute interviews.&#xd;
Findings in the study indicated that Latinas are faced with many conflicts. They have specific gender role expectations placed on them and are limited by cultural rules and norms. Along with these conflicts they learn to build resilience/persistence attributes to help them succeed in their academic careers. The seven factors that contributed to the lived experiences and factors of resilience/persistence of Latina/Hispanic female academic success included: 1) lived discrimination; 2) the need to obtain an education that would lead to a better life; 3) active involvement in extracurricular activities in school; 4) strict and protective parents; 5) positive role models from family and other Latinas; 6) traumatic life experiences; 7) and strong familial/parental support. Additionally, the study also revealed six more contributing factors to the sociocultural and gender role expectations and pressures that impact the success of Latina/Hispanic female students in a K-12 public school system. Those factors included traditional Hispanic households, living in two worlds, traditional gender role expectations, independence from family, transference of parental gender role expectations, and the behavioral expectations for Latinas. The study offers recommendations for future studies and implications for practice advising and encouraging Hispanic females to pursue their academic goals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the current study was to identify if any significant relationships between inspiration, temperament, and positive affect existed. The dependent variable was inspiration, which was measured by the Inspiration Scale (IS). Temperament was measured by the Keirsey Temperament Sorter II and positive affect by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). One hundred forty-five students attending a large Midwestern university and small community college participated. Initially, participants completed the Keirsey Temperament Sorter II online. The IS and PANAS were administered in the student’s classroom. &#xd;
The data were consequently analyzed to determine if there was a correlation between inspiration and temperament, inspiration and positive affect, and inspiration and the combined effects of temperament and positive affect. The results were mixed:&#xd;
1. No relationship between inspiration and temperament was discovered. ANOVA results indicated that mean inspiration scores for each temperament did not vary significantly. &#xd;
2. A relationship was identified between inspiration and positive affect. Regression results suggested a positive linear relationship between inspiration and positive affect scores. &#xd;
3. When inspiration was correlated with positive affect and temperament combined, no relationship was discovered. A 2 x 4 ANOVA showed no correlation between the variables. &#xd;
The implications these results have on psychology and counseling are discussed, along recommendations for future research. Additionally, limitations of the study, such as inherent risks associated with using self-report measures, are mentioned. The study concludes with a discussion of how future research can investigate inspiration, temperament, and positive affect.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Anthrax is a highly fatal disease caused by the gram-positive, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Spores, rather than the vegetative bacterial cells, are the source of anthrax infections. The spores of B. anthracis are enclosed by a prominent loose-fitting structure called the exosporium. The exosporium is composed of a basal layer and an external hair-like nap. The filaments of the hair-like nap are made up largely of a single collagen-like glycoprotein called BclA. A second glycoprotein, BclB, has been identified in the exosporium layer. The specific location of this glycoprotein within the exosporium layer and its role in the biology of the spore are unknown. We created a mutant strain of B. anthracis ΔSterne that carries a deletion of the bclB gene. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the mutant strain produced spores with increased amounts of the BclA glycoprotein expressed on their surface. Differences in exosporium composition between the mutant and wild-type spores were identified. The mutant was also found to possess structural defects in the exosporium layer of the spore (visualized by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry) resulting in an exosporium that is more fragile than that of a wild-type spore and is easily lost. The resistance properties of the mutant spores were unchanged from that of the wild-type spores. The bclB mutation did not affect spore germination or kinetics of spore survival within macrophages. BclB plays a key role in the formation and maintenance of a rigid and complete exosporium structure in B. anthracis. BclB plays a key role in the formation and maintenance of the exosporium structure in B. anthracis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The polarities of several cells that divide asymmetrically during C. elegans development are controlled by Wnt signaling. LIN-44/Wnt and LIN-17/Fz control the polarities of cells in the tail of developing C. elegans larvae, including the male-specific blast cell, B, which divides asymmetrically to generate a larger anterior daughter and a smaller posterior daughter. We determined that the canonical Wnt pathway components are not involved in the control of B cell polarity. However, POP-1/Tcf is involved and asymmetrically distributed to B daughter nuclei. Aspects of the B cell division are reminiscent of the divisions controlled by the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway that has been described in both Drosophila and vertebrate systems. We identified C. elegans homologs of Wnt/PCP components and have determined that many of them appear to be involved in the regulation of B cell polarity and POP-1 asymmetric distribution to B daughter nuclei. Thus a non-canonical Wnt pathway, which is different from other Wnt pathways in C. elegans, but similar to the PCP pathways, appears to regulate B cell polarity. &#xd;
Molecular mechanisms of this PCP pathway were also investigated. We determined that LIN-17/Fz is asymmetrically distributed to the B cell cortex prior to, during, and after, division. Furthermore, the asymmetric localization of LIN-17::GFP is controlled by LIN-44/Wnt and MIG-5/Dsh. The cysteine rich domain (CRD), seven trans-membrane domain and KTXXXW motif of LIN-17 are required for LIN-17 to rescue lin-17, while only seven trans-membrane domains and KTXXXW motif are required for LIN-17 asymmetric localization. MIG-5::GFP asymmetrically localized to the B cell prior to and after division in a LIN-17/Fz dependent manner. We examined the functions of these MIG-5 domains. The DEP domain is required for MIG-5 membrane association, while the PDZ domain is responsible for different levels of MIG-5 in the B daughters. The DEP and PDZ domain are required to rescue B cell polarity defect of mig-5 males, while the DIX domain is not that important. In summary, a novel PCP-like pathway, in which LIN-17 and MIG-5 are asymmetrically localized, is conserved in C. elegans and involved in the regulation of B cell polarity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Four high schools with high ELL enrollment and a high percentage of teachers taking graduate-level ESL courses participated in this quantitative study. The content-area teachers completed a Survey of Teachers’ Knowledge and Value of Implementation of Content and Language Objectives. The survey included two sections: (a) a demographics section and (b) a support section in which respondents self-rated their knowledge and value on content and language objectives. &#xd;
Descriptive statistics were used to generate the mean, standard deviation, and frequency distribution of the demographics of the samples, which were independent variables of this study. Inferential statistics on the research hypotheses were calculated using multiple correlation/regression and one-way ANOVA. &#xd;
Results from the support section indicated respondents perceived their knowledge and value on content and language objectives were not lacking. However, results also revealed that teachers rated themselves lower on knowledge and value on implementing language objectives than they did on knowledge and value on implementing content objectives. In addition, data analysis revealed that percentage of students who were ELL last year and hours of ESL related training can be linked to the teachers’ self-rated degree of knowledge and value on implementing content and language objectives.&#xd;
As a result of this study, five recommendations for practice were made. Of these, the researcher believes the following to be most crucial: (1) Because the number of ELL students continues to increase, even those teachers who currently have a small number of ELL students in their classrooms must be willing to enhance their knowledge and value on content and language objectives; (2) Teacher educators for pre-service programs should place greater emphasis on the integration and implementation of content and language objectives; and (3) Staff developers should be informed of a need to increase the professional development of in-service teachers with regard to language objectives. &#xd;
Among other recommendations for future research, the researcher suggests the need for future studies to include more specific investigations on how teachers construct language objectives. Furthermore, future studies should pursue ways to encourage educators to participate in ESL related workshops or trainings and to form mentoring relationships with colleagues.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sexual selection via female choice and male-male aggression leads to elaboration of male traits.  If male traits correlated with reproductive success are honest signals of male quality, survival costs may be associated with the expression of those traits. Testosterone (hereafter ‘T’) may enhance male breeding success, but T can also reduce immunocompetence and survival.  Socially monogamous male birds with higher circulating T experience reproductive advantages, but the role of T in lek mating systems is largely unknown.  To address these issues, I individually marked and conducted focal behavioral observations of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) at five lek sites over a 5-year period.  Females were fitted with radio-telemetry to monitor nesting success and survival.  I examined the relationship between male traits and mating success using multinomial discrete choice models, a statistical method not previously applied to studies of sexual selection.  Male mating success was highly skewed at greater prairie-chicken leks with 18.5% of males obtaining 87.2% of all successful copulations (n = 108 males; 85 copulations).  Mating success was influenced most by male behavior, followed by several morphological attributes.  The role of T was quantified using blood samples and by experimentally implanting a subset of males with T.  T did not consistently affect mating success.  Non-territorial males had lower T levels than territorial males.  Among territory holders, T was unexpectedly negatively correlated with mating success.  However, the odds of receiving a copulation were 4.3 times (0.42 to 45.3) greater for T-implanted males than males with sham implants.  Future work should explore the interactions among the immune system, parasite load, and mating success of prairie-chickens.  Annual survival of male prairie-chickens was not related to mating success, behavior, age or T level, suggesting there is no cost of increased male mating success.  Like males, reproductive success of females was also highly skewed because &lt; 10% of nests successfully hatched young.  Comparisons of seasonal and annual survival rates indicate that females experience increased mortality during the breeding season relative to the nonbreeding season.  Synthesis of field estimates of demographic parameters indicates prairie-chicken populations will decline without changes in rangeland management to reduce predator numbers or provide more nesting cover.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and other combustion by-products of gas turbines have long been identified as harmful atmospheric pollutants to the environment and humans. Various government agencies place restrictions on emissions and often require some sort of emissions monitoring even for new low emission gas turbines. Predicting actual emissions from operating parameters that affect the formation of pollutants, called parametric emissions monitoring system (PEMS), has potential economic advantages compared to a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS). The problem is that a simple applicable PEMS does not exist.&#xd;
During this study, a gas turbine combustor model applying first engineering principles was developed to predict the emission formation of NOx and CO in a gas turbine. The model is based on a lean-premixed combustor with a main and pilot burner including the function of a bleeding air valve. The model relies on ambient condition and load. The load is expressed as a percentage of the target speed of the gas producer turbine. Air flow and fuel flow for the main and pilot burner are calculated by the model based on the load through a set of measured input data for a specific gas turbine. To find the combustion temperature characteristics, the combustor is divided into several zones. The temperature for each zone is calculated by applying an energy balance. To predict NOx and CO, several correlations explored by various researchers are used and compared against each other, using the calculated temperatures, pressures and equivalence ratios.&#xd;
A comparison between collected emissions examples from a turbine test cell data spreadsheet and predicted emissions by the developed model under the same conditions show a highly accurate match for NOx emission at any load. Because of the high variation of CO at part load, the model predictions only match the CO data set at full load.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A Surface Tension Element (STE), device was successfully constructed and tested as the primary moisture removal device in a condensing dryer. The STE was tested via the SAE ARP901 bubble-point test method and resulted in an average micron rating of 46.8 microns. The operation of the STE was compared to that of the typical air-to-air heat exchanger/condenser used in condensing dryers. The total power consumption and IEC efficiency of each case were averaged and compared. The results indicated that the STE used an average of 0.616 kilowatt-hours per kilogram dry laundry while the air-to-air heat exchanger/condenser used an average of 0.643 kWh/kg. This resulted in an improvement of the European efficiency label from class C to Class B. An analytical model was also constructed that well predicted the operation of the STE under steady state conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Water quality in the United States needs to be improved. Currently, 42% (39%&#xd;
of rivers and streams, 45% of lakes and reservoirs) of monitored surface water is&#xd;
considered impaired, indicating that it is no longer suitable for its designated uses such&#xd;
as drinking, recreation, habitat, food supply, agriculture, and ground water recharge&#xd;
(USEPA, 2000, Carpenter et al., 1998). Nonpoint source pollution can be associated&#xd;
with animal manure. This project focuses on two sources of nonpoint source&#xd;
pollution. The first source is runoff from soils that have been enriched in nutrients&#xd;
(nitrogen and phosphorus) by manure application. This project evaluates how&#xd;
effective Alfalfa is at removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from nutrient enriched soils.&#xd;
It also evaluates the use of USDA’s Plant Nutrient model in association with nutrient&#xd;
management plans to prevent enrichment of soils. It was determined that Alfalfa is&#xd;
effective in reduction of nitrogen in soils; however, it was not feasible as a stand alone&#xd;
practice to remediate phosphorus. The use of USDA’s Plant Nutrient model indicated&#xd;
that Corn for silage is the most effective crop for reduction of soil phosphorus while&#xd;
alfalfa and the yields produced in 2004 was the most effective in reduction nitrogen.&#xd;
However, the model tends to underestimate soil nutrient uptake, so it is important to&#xd;
have soil tests conducted periodically to prevent nutrient deficiencies. The second&#xd;
source of nonpoint pollution discussed is runoff from animal feeding operations. This&#xd;
paper evaluates the effects of grass filter strips in prevention of pollution transport off&#xd;
of animal feeding operations. It was determined that filter strips with a ratio of runoff&#xd;
area to filter area of 1:2 is the minimum ratio to effectively prevent nonpoint source&#xd;
pollution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objectives were to determine the effects of packaging and injection-enhancement on beef sensory attributes, postmortem proteolysis, and color.  Muscles from USDA Select, A-maturity carcasses were fabricated into 2.54-cm steaks on d 7 postmortem.  In Experiment 1, longissimus lumborum (n=14 pairs) muscles were used.  Packaging treatments were: vacuum packaging (VP); 80% O2/20% CO2 (HiO2); 0.4% CO/35% CO2/64.6%N2 (ULO2CO); 0.4% CO/99.6% CO2; 0.4% CO/99.6% N2; or 0.4% CO/99.6% Ar.  In Experiment 2, longissimus lumborum (n=12 pairs); semitendinosus (n=12 pairs); and triceps brachii (n=24 pairs) muscles from one carcass side were injection-enhanced or non-enhanced.  Steaks were packaged into VP, HiO2, or ULO2CO MAP.  Steaks packaged in HiO2 MAP were in dark storage (2°C) for 4 d and all other steaks for 14 d.  Steaks were displayed under fluorescent lighting for 7 d. Trained color panelists assigned color scores.  Steaks for tenderness, cooked color, and sensory were cooked to 70°C.  Steaks packaged in VP or ULO2 with CO MAP had little or no discoloration.  Steaks packaged in HiO2 MAP discolored faster (P &lt; 0.05) and more (P &lt; 0.05) than steaks in other packaging treatments.  Steaks packaged in HiO2 MAP were less tender (P &lt; 0.05) than other treatments at the end of display, but had 10 d less aging due to shorter dark storage.  Steaks packaged in HiO2 had the lowest (P &lt; 0.05) a* values for internal cooked color of all treatments and exhibited premature browning.  Enhanced steaks were more tender (P &lt; 0.05) than non-enhanced steaks.  Sensory panelists found that non-enhanced steaks packaged in ULO2CO MAP or VP were more tender (P &lt; 0.05), had more (P &lt; 0.05) beef flavor, and had less (P &lt; 0.05) off-flavors than steaks packaged in HiO2 MAP.  Off-flavors for steaks packaged in HiO2 MAP often were described as oxidative and rancid.  Enhanced steaks had more (P &lt; 0.05) off-flavors than non-enhanced steaks.  Postmortem proteolysis measured by desmin degradation was not affected (P > 0.05) by packaging.  Steaks packaged in ULO2 plus CO MAP had superior color stability, tenderness, and sensory attributes compared to steaks in HiO2 MAP.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As energy efficient devices become more necessary, it is desired to increase the&#xd;
efficiency of air conditioning systems. Current systems use on/off control, where the unit&#xd;
primarily operates in the long lasting start up transients. A proposed solution is an air&#xd;
conditioning unit that runs continuously with active computer control implemented to&#xd;
maximize efficiency. The objective of this thesis is to develop a mathematical model for&#xd;
a specific air conditioning unit and to compare this model to measurements made on the&#xd;
specific unit. This model can then be used to develop a multi-input multi-output control&#xd;
law in the future.&#xd;
In this thesis, a linearized moving interface lumped parameter model is presented,&#xd;
and the derivation verified with great detail. The model predicts transient perturbations&#xd;
from a steady state operating point. The air conditioner tested in this work required&#xd;
several modifications including the addition of sensors and controllers. A description of&#xd;
the system is provided. Methods used to determine all of the parameters for the model&#xd;
are given with explanation. The model is simulated with computer software and&#xd;
compared with experimental data. Simulations predict the final value of superheat and&#xd;
pressures in the evaporator and condenser well for step changes in the compressor speed&#xd;
and expansion valve opening.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nutrition education programs strive to help low-income people make optimal food choices while living on a limited budget. This study addressed perceived understanding, acceptance, and usability of Food and Nutrition Bytes, a set of 12 eight- to eleven-minute online Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) lessons. Clients in EFNEP during 2005-2006 were surveyed on internet usage and interest in online nutrition lessons. Lessons were developed and assessed for reading levels using two formulas. Clients and professionals in six Kansas counties completed a Likert scale survey and gave comments after they viewed one online lesson. Fifty-five percent of 75 EFNEP clients who had internet access indicated they were interested in taking nutrition lessons online. The new lessons averaged a 6.64 grade reading level. Two lessons had content that was rated too general to be useful. For the remaining lessons, both groups ranked their perceived understanding, helpfulness of graphics and audio, and usefulness of information at the first or second most-desirable rating. They rated length and amount of information as “Just Right.” The only difference found between the groups was when clients rated one lesson as having a little too much information and professionals rated it as having not quite enough (Mann-Whitney U = 35.0, p = 0.039). Within-sample associations were measured for two lessons. Clients older than 30 years of age found the Grains lesson’s pictures and graphics to be more helpful than did younger clients (Kendall tau-b = 0.593, p = 0.002). White clients evaluated the Cooking lesson as being easier to understand than did non-white clients (Kendall tau-b = -0.477, p = 0.020). The most frequent comments pertained to the importance of portion sizes and appropriate pictures and graphics. Overall, Food and Nutrition Bytes lessons were easy to read, and perceived by both clients and professionals to be easy to understand, helpful and useful, and also optimal in length and amount of information. Despite low numbers of EFNEP clients who had internet access, over half were interested in taking lessons online. Limitations of this study include small samples, convenience samples, subjects’ time constraints, and interviewer bias.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 2003, the EPA changed Confined Animal Feedlot Operation (CAFO) regulations to allow an alternative treatment system for feedlot runoff if a 25-year simulation can show better performance for the alternative treatment system when compared to a traditional lagoon system.  A continuous computer simulation model written in C was developed to compare the release of water, nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from a Vegetated Treatment Area (VTA) system and a conventional lagoon system in Kansas. The model simulates the transport of water and constituents in a feedlot, settling basin, lagoon, and VTA.  The feedlot runoff is based on NRCS unit hydrograph method for the water balance and AnnAgNPS for the constituent runoff concentrations.  The settling basin is a simple water balance with sediment, organic-N, P, and COD removed with settling of the solids.  The VTA is designed to calculate infiltration with Green-Ampt Equation and overland flow with Manning's Law.  The VTA removes organic-N and P with the Kentucky Filtration Model.  The lagoon is derived from Koelliker et al. model water balance and pumping schedule with constituent balance from Miner et al. model.  &#xd;
VTA portion of the model was analyzed for sensitivity and calibrated with three storms.  The sensitivity analysis showed that the size of the VTA and conductivity of the soil in the VTA causes the greatest variability in the release of N, P, and COD.  The calibration of the release of organic-N and P for mean particle diameter showed that a diameter of 1.5 µm produced the best agreement.  The model was used for a lagoon and VTA system at two sites in Kansas with 35 years of weather data.  The sites were located in Ottawa and Greenwood Counties, KS.  The simulated results showed that the lagoon system performed better for both sites when comparing the mean values of total-N, total-P, and COD released over the 35 years.  The VTA system performance was better when median values of total-P and COD were compared at Greenwood County.  This model was designed for use in Kansas, but with modifications may be useful in other areas.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The field of microfluidic devices has being developed quickly. It is aimed at integration of many chemical functions in a single chip, such as sample pretreatment, preconcentration, separation and detection, which provides a number of advantages including simplicity, automation, reduced analysis time, decrease in amount of samples and reduced formation of waste. Its potential applications have been conducted in the fields such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, life sciences, public health, agriculture and related areas.&#xd;
Membrane technology has been applied in analytical chemistry for many years and has won substantial growth in microfluidics over the past 10 years. Membrane is used to control transfer of some kinds of species, which can be employed for sample concentration, sample preparation, sample filtration and microreactors and so on. Sol-gel process, which usually involves catalytic hydrolysis of sol-gel precursor(s) and catalytic polycondensation of the hydrolyzed products and other sol-gel-active components present in the reaction medium to form a macromolecular network structure, is one of the most suitable methods for membrane fabrication. In this work, titanium membrane was fabricated inside glass microchips using the precursor of titanium isopropoxide. The resulted membranes demonstrated the excellent preconcentration effect. Followed separation and detection were also achieved.&#xd;
CE has been highly accepted as an efficient separation technique for qualitative and quantitative determination, which is performed using a narrow-bore capillary tube. It offers advantages of simplicity, high resolution separation, and minimal cost in terms of analysis time and sample consumption. In this work, protein separations were carried out by CE. Laser-induced fluorescence was used as detection. On-column fluorescence labeling using a fluorogenic labeling reagent was made. Under suitable experimental conditions, an excellent separation performance with about 1.4 million theoretical plate numbers was achieved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Polycarbonate products have been used extensively world wide for decades because they are lightweight, shatter-resistant and considered to be safe. Polycarbonate is a thermoplastic that is used to make compact discs, phones, lenses, and food contact products such as water bottles, baby bottles and food storage containers.&#xd;
&#xd;
For more than half century, there has been interest in polycarbonate (PC) products and the monomer bisphenol-A (BPA) because BPA can leach from food polycarbonate containers. The environmental fate for both chemicals in air, water and soil is of interest, also. To understand the fate of polycarbonate, its main degradation pathways, main degradation mechanisms and main products are reviewed.  These pathways are thermal degradation, photo-degradation and hydrolysis under different conditions. Furthermore, key topics like PC degradation kinetics and PC chemical resistance are part of this comprehensive discussion. &#xd;
&#xd;
The biodegradation of BPA has been thoroughly studied. About twelve lab methods for environmental fate are summarized and reviewed to understand the “big picture” for BPA degradation. This includes screening tests, which assess the ready and inherent degradability, to simulation tests for surface waters, soils and wastewater treatment systems. The testing of all methods is examined under conditions close to the real environment fate. Furthermore, the fate distribution for BPA based on the Equilibrium Criterion Model (EQC) model is reviewed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Extensive research on polycarbonate and BPA has been conducted in the last fifty years. During this time, both chemicals have been studied and tested by industry and government agencies.  The pharmacological test results from major studies indicate that consumer exposure to BPA at concentrations normally experienced in daily living does not pose a risk to human health. On the other hand, minor toxicological studies indicate potential risks to human health. Research on health and safety are continuing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation introduces a novel approach for optimally operating a day-ahead electricity market not only by economically dispatching the generation resources but also by minimizing the influences of market manipulation attempts by the individual generator-owning companies while ensuring that the power system constraints are not violated. Since economic operation of the market conflicts with the individual profit maximization tactics such as market manipulation by generator-owning companies, a methodology that is capable of simultaneously optimizing these two competing objectives has to be selected. Although numerous previous studies have been undertaken on the economic operation of day-ahead markets and other independent studies have been conducted on the mitigation of market power, the operation of a day-ahead electricity market considering these two conflicting objectives simultaneously has not been undertaken previously. These facts provided the incentive and the novelty for this study. &#xd;
	&#xd;
A literature survey revealed that many of the traditional solution algorithms convert multi-objective functions into either a single-objective function using weighting schemas or undertake optimization of one function at a time. Hence, these approaches do not truly optimize the multi-objectives concurrently. Due to these inherent deficiencies of the traditional algorithms, the use of alternative non-traditional solution algorithms for such problems has become popular and widely used. Of these, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) have received wide acceptance due to their solution quality and robustness. In the present research, three distinct algorithms were considered: a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II), a multi-objective tabu search algorithm (MOTS) and a hybrid of multi-objective tabu search and genetic algorithm (MOTS/GA).  The accuracy and quality of the results from these algorithms for applications similar to the problem investigated here reinforced the selection of these algorithms. The results obtained from each of the three algorithms used in the evaluations are very comparable. Thus one could safely conclude that the results obtained are valid.  Three distinct test power systems operating under different conditions were studied for evaluating the suitability of each of these algorithms. The test cases included scenarios in which the power system was unconstrained as well as constrained. Repeated simulations carried out for the same test case with varying starting points provided evidence that the algorithms and the solutions were robust. &#xd;
&#xd;
Influences of different market concentrations on the optimal economic dispatch are evidenced by the pareto-optimal-fronts obtained for each test case studied. Results obtained from a traditional linear programming (LP) based solution algorithm that is used at present by many market operators are also presented for comparison. Very high market-concentration-indices were found for each solution from the LP algorithm.  This suggests the need to use a formal method for mitigating market concentration.  Operating the market at industry-recommended threshold levels of market concentration for selecting an optimal operational point is presented for all test cases studied. Given that a solution-set instead of a single operating point is found from the multi-objective optimization methods, additional flexibility to select any operational point based on the preference of those operating the market clearly is an added benefit of using multi-objective optimization methods. However, in order to help the market operator, a more logical fuzzy decision criterion was tested for selecting a suitable operating point. The results show that the optimal operating point chosen using the fuzzy decision criterion provides a higher economic benefit to the market, although at a slightly increased market concentration. &#xd;
	&#xd;
	Since the main objective of this research was to simultaneously optimize the economic operation of a day-ahead market while ensuring minimal market power by individual generator owners, the proposed method is much improved from the current industry practice. The current practice of after-the-fact mitigation of market power has created various problems for both the market operator and the market participants, giving rise to a large numbers of disputes and resettlement activities. Hence, an approach that mitigates market power at the time of market dispatch as used in this research would bring about a more efficient market operation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The aim of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is to identify association between&#xd;
DNA marker genotype and trait phenotype in experimental populations. Many QTL mapping&#xd;
methods have been developed to improve QTL detecting power and estimation of QTL location&#xd;
and effect. Recently, shrinkage Bayesian and penalized maximum-likelihood estimation&#xd;
approaches have been shown to give increased power and resolution for estimating QTL main or&#xd;
epistatic effect. Here I describe a new method, shrinkage interval mapping, that combines the&#xd;
advantages of these two methods while avoiding the computing load associated with them.&#xd;
Studies based on simulated and real data show that shrinkage interval mapping provides higher&#xd;
resolution for differentiating closely linked QTLs and higher power for identifying QTLs of&#xd;
small effect than conventional interval-mapping methods, with no greater computing time.&#xd;
A second new method developed in the course of this research toward increasing QTL&#xd;
mapping efficiency is the extension of multi-trait QTL mapping to accommodate incomplete&#xd;
phenotypic data. I describe an EM-based algorithm for exploiting all the phenotypic and&#xd;
genotypic information contained in the data. This method supports conventional hypothesis tests&#xd;
for QTL main effect, pleiotropy, and QTL-by-environment interaction. Simulations confirm&#xd;
improved QTL detection power and precision of QTL location and effect estimation in&#xd;
comparison with casewise deletion or imputation methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The overall goal of this study was to evaluate and apply the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for fecal bacteria modeling. Methods were developed to characterize fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) from livestock, human, and wildlife sources to use as input in the model. Model&#xd;
sensitivity to predict FCB concentration was evaluated for the model parameters and input&#xd;
parameters using both SWAT 2000 and 2005 versions. Sensitivity of input parameters generally,&#xd;
ranked as Bacteria concentration ≥ TBACT > Wildlife source loads > Livestock stocking rate ≥ Livestock manure production rate > BACTKDQ for SWAT 2000 whereas it was ranked as&#xd;
BACTKDQ > TBACT > Bacteria concentration > WDLPQ > WDLPS for SWAT 2005. Sensitivity&#xd;
of model and input parameters were found changed from SWAT 2000.&#xd;
The SWAT (2005) model was calibrated and validated for daily flow, sediment, and fecal&#xd;
bacteria concentration using one year of measured data (January to December, 2004). The SWAT&#xd;
model predicted results with poor to very good agreement when compared with measured data with coefficient of determination (R2) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index (E) range of 0.10 to 0.89 for daily flows, sediment, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and total FCB concentration. More extensive&#xd;
in-stream data are needed for more comprehensive model assessment. The SWAT model (2005) was evaluated for source-specific FCB modeling using three years (2004-2006) of observed modified&#xd;
deterministic probability of bacteria source tracking (BST) data. The FCB sources were modeled with three combinations (livestock and human, livestock and wildlife, wildlife and human) and each single source to evaluate the source-specific FCB concentrations. The SWAT model determined poor to good agreement for the combined source of FCB (R2, E range from -2.92 to 0.71) but determined generally decreased agreement for each single source of bacteria (R2, E range from -5.03 to 0.39)&#xd;
potentially due to BST uncertainty, spatial variability and source characterization.&#xd;
The SWAT model identified critical sub-watersheds in the watershed where implementing vegetative filter strips (VFS) could be most effective to abate fecal bacteria pollution. The targeting&#xd;
method of VFS application to the watershed sub-basins was found to be more effective in reducing both FCB (60% vs. 42%) and sediment yield (63% vs. 33%) as compared to a random approach.&#xd;
The FCB source characterization methods for modeling developed in this study are general&#xd;
and have the potential to be extended to other watersheds. The results of this study demonstrate that the SWAT model can be used to characterize the distribution of bacteria sources within a bacteria impaired&#xd;
watershed and assist with developing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and watershed&#xd;
restoration strategies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Studies on fear of crime demonstrate that fear of rape controls women’s lives by altering emotions and behavior, though how women construct rape discourse through social networks has not been examined. Further, studies tend to dismiss stranger rape because of its rarity compared to acquaintance rape, but this study argues that research must begin where women are. This study looks to women’s voices to articulate how they talk about fear of rape; specifically, it examines responses to a serial rapist at work in a college town. Framed by feminist methodology, this study establishes the influence of fear on women’s lives and the role of women’s social networks in disseminating information, constructing strategies, and changing behavior as it relates to a local serial rapist. The study utilizes a multi-method approach to quantify levels of fear in the community and to document qualitatively women’s responses to knowledge about the serial rapist. Two surveys, content analysis of local newspapers, and interviews support this research. In particular, group interviews conducted in two environments – campus face-to-face groups and online virtual groups – provide opportunities for young women to voice concerns and report behavioral changes related to the serial rapes. The research demonstrates that women are concerned about insufficient information from formal sources and want more accurate reporting. Women depend heavily on informal networks for information, but it is often incomplete and/or inaccurate and may actually intensify fear. As documented in earlier research, women focus on stranger rape to the neglect of the more common acquaintance rape and tend to strategize in individual terms rather than recognize structural issues. A major finding of this research is that young women actually perceive a change in their own identity as they try to manage fear of rape. However, women’s social networks and, in particular, the increasingly popular online networks, provide a forum from which to try out strategies, build collective discourse, and, in turn, develop greater group consciousness among young women. From the experiences of women in this study, several policy implications are offered for managing fear, including education about the more likely threat of acquaintance rape.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Palmer amaranth is a competitive weed and has caused variable corn yield losses in diverse environments of Kansas.  The objectives of this study were to 1) determine corn and Palmer amaranth growth, development, and grain (seed) production, 2) determine soil water content throughout the growing season, and 3) evaluate the performance of the modified ALMANAC model for simulating monoculture corn yield and corn yield loss from Palmer amaranth competition when corn and Palmer amaranth were grown alone or in competition under dryland and irrigated environments.  For the first objective, field experiments were conducted in 2005 and 2006 with whole-plots of dryland and furrow irrigation arranged in a side-by-side design.  Within each soil water environment, sub-plot treatments were monoculture Palmer amaranth at one plant m-1 of row, and corn with zero, one, and four Palmer amaranth plants m-1 of row.  Corn height, leaf number, LAI, and total plant dry weight were reduced with increasing water stress and were reduced further in the presence of Palmer amaranth.  Corn yield losses were similar with increasing Palmer amaranth density across soil water environments in each year, except for 2006 dryland corn.  Palmer amaranth growth and development were negatively impacted by corn interference and weed density.  For the second objective, Time Domain Reflectometry measurements documented seasonal trends of volumetric soil water content at the 0 to 15 and 0 to 30 cm soil profile depths for treatments in dryland and irrigated environments each year.  The soil water depletion rate increased as water received prior to a drying period increased at the 0 to 30 cm soil depth in the dryland and irrigated environments.  For the third objective, the modified ALMANAC model was parameterized based on monoculture corn and Palmer amaranth growth data.  The model underestimated monoculture corn yield but overestimated corn yield with Palmer amaranth competition.  The model performance was not consistent when comparing simulation results to dryland and irrigated experiments conducted across Kansas.  Overall, the experiment provided an improved understanding of corn yield loss risks associated with water management and Palmer amaranth competition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The geographic distribution and structure of the U.S. dairy industry have changed considerably during the last 30 years with larger herds representing an increasing proportion of the nation’s overall dairy cow inventory and producing a greater share of the milk.  Geographically, the migration of dairies from traditional production regions to states formerly unfamiliar with dairy production has transpired with the greatest increases in Federal Milk Marketing Order marketings occurring in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, West Texas and Southwest Kansas since the 1980’s.  This study seeks to define the factors influencing the dairy location decision applying spatial econometric techniques. &#xd;
 To examine the effects of county-specific demographic, environmental, and market factors as well as to test for the influence of spatial agglomeration economies on the geographic distribution of the U.S. dairy industry, a spatially explicit, county-level model of the dairy production sector was developed.  Quantities of milk marketed through the Federal Milk Marketing Order during the month of May for counties in 45 states during 1997 and 2002 were specified as a function of natural endowments, business climate, production resource availability, milk price, and market access.  The model was estimated according to spatial autoregressive (spatially lagged dependent variable) and spatial Durbin (lagged dependent and independent variables) specifications accounting for the censored nature of the dependent variable and heteroskedastic errors.  Based on RMSE, the spatial error model was selected to make out of sample predictions for 2004.  The change in milk marketings between 1997 and 2002 was regressed on the 1997 independent variables using non-Tobit versions of the same models with limited success.   &#xd;
Results indicated a small but statistically significant presence of spatial agglomeration effects in the dairy industry in both 1997 and 2002 and revealed changes in the degrees of influence of several variables between the two periods examined.  Population and the wages of agricultural workers became significant in 2002, while the elasticities of feed availability diminished, consistent with an increase in western-style dairy production.  Interestingly, the spatial parameter decreased from 0.052 in 1997 to 0.028 in 2002 suggesting spatial agglomeration economies had a diminishing role in determining the amount of milk marketed in a county.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An underlying goal of studying atomic or molecular dynamics with short laser pulses is to reach a time scale short enough to study the evolution of the system in the time domain. In this thesis, the strong field ionization of atoms and molecules has been investigated with the highly resolved technique known as cold target recoil momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS). The thesis can be divided into two parts: single and double ionization. &#xd;
In the first part, we studied the momentum vectors of low energy electrons generated by short laser pulses of wavelengths varying from 400 to 800 nm with atomic and molecular targets with intensities in the tunneling region. Most of the structures observed in the momentum spectra of atomic and molecular targets can be explained as due to above-threshold ionization, and Freeman resonances. The most significant structure in our observed spectra is the angular structure in the lowest part of the momentum image, and this is attributed to the diffraction pattern evolved by tunneling electrons. Surprisingly, we observed that the structure produced by the electrons from high Rydberg states is independent of the internal structure of the target atom and molecules. The same work is extended to aligned molecules. The basic idea of this part of the work is to see whether the angular distribution of electrons from aligned molecules resembles the orbital structures of the molecules. The rotational revival structure was used to align the molecules. We observed pronounced energy and angular structures of the momentum images which show a dependence on the alignment of the molecule. &#xd;
 The last part of this work mainly focuses on double ionization, i.e. the removal of two electrons from the target atoms sequentially by a short laser pulse. Measuring the complete momentum vector of Ar2+ and Ne2+, we demonstrate that these can be used to extract the angular correlation between two electrons sequentially released in the circularly polarized pulse. We demonstrate how the measurement of full momentum vectors of the doubly ionized argon and neon ions can be used to extract the time gap of the two emissions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During the past twenty-five years, the number of prison programs in which inmates train dogs has increased rapidly.  A lack of systematic studies to address the effects of these programs on staff and inmates has led to limited, anecdotal accounts of the impact of these programs on correctional institutions and their occupants.  In addition, an analysis of differences in these effects for men and women is missing.  This paper proposes to bridge this gap through qualitative research conducted in two Kansas prisons (a men’s and a women’s institution) in which inmates train assistance dogs and dogs made available for adoption by the general public.  Drawing primarily on the works of Erving Goffman, Michel Foucault, and Jill McCorkel, I focus on the mechanisms of social control and resistance within these programs and their effect on the inmates participating in the program, utilizing a gendered analysis throughout.  Using the experiences of the men and women in these programs, as well as those of correctional staff and community members, I propose that these programs provide an important outlet for resistance for the participants.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This exploratory study examines abortion decision-making attitudes of&#xd;
adolescents attending Roman Catholic schools. With a theoretical background using both&#xd;
cognitive-developmental theory and moral development theory, this study investigated&#xd;
adolescent abortion decision-making attitudes with a multi-part paper and pencil survey.&#xd;
The first part of the Abortion Attitude Scale consisted of a combination of the&#xd;
seven General Social Survey (GSS) abortion questions, intermingled with seven&#xd;
additional author-devised abortion questions. The second part of the survey consisted of&#xd;
sixteen reality-based scenarios, each containing a high or low level of four dimensions.&#xd;
The dimensions consisted of the four most common reasons for abortion females wrote&#xd;
about in their online written testimonies about their actual abortion experiences. The four&#xd;
dimensions were determined after the author conducted a frequency count of reasons for&#xd;
abortion originating from 87 testimonies from pro-choice web sites and 82 testimonies&#xd;
from pro-life web sites, plus phone calls to 8 pro-choice agencies and phone calls to 8&#xd;
pro-life agencies.&#xd;
The Abortion Attitude Scale was offered to a convenience sample of 8th through&#xd;
12th graders attending the Topeka, Kansas Catholic Schools, which includes five&#xd;
elementary schools and one high school. Written parental consent and written student&#xd;
ascent were required for students to be eligible to participate in the study. A total of 350&#xd;
students participated.&#xd;
The study’s six hypotheses explored whether or not the combined GSS and&#xd;
author-devised abortion questions are unidimensional; whether or not interaction effects&#xd;
exist among the four dimensions in each of the scenarios; and how the independent&#xd;
variables of gender, age, ethnicity, and intrinsic religiosity may impact adolescents’&#xd;
abortion attitudes.&#xd;
Results suggest several conclusions. The GSS and author-devised abortion&#xd;
questions are multidimensional. Regarding the four dimensions used in each of the&#xd;
scenarios, there were interaction effects among the four dimensions. Whereas the&#xd;
adolescent female participants in this study did appear to be less accepting of abortion&#xd;
than the male participants, and the adolescents with higher intrinsic religiosity appeared&#xd;
to be less accepting of abortion, the hypotheses regarding younger age and greater ethnic&#xd;
diversity did not appear to lend support to adolescents being less accepting of abortion.&#xd;
The findings thus appear to show that this study’s participants had complex attitudes&#xd;
about abortion decision-making, and that these attitudes appear to be at least somewhat&#xd;
situationally-dependent.&#xd;
Implications for further studies are discussed, along with limitations and&#xd;
conclusions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Escherichia coli O157:H7 has emerged as a significant human food-borne pathogen over the past two decades. While cattle have been identified as the major reservoir of the pathogen, the dynamics of shedding are still largely unknown. The role immunosuppression may play on fecal shedding in cattle is explored. &#xd;
The first study determined whether immunosuppression induced by dexamethasone injections affects the level and duration of fecal shedding of E. coli O157. Six one week old Holstein bull calves were injected intramuscularly with dexamethasone and orally inoculated with 109 CFU of a mixture of three nalidixic-acid resistant strains of E. coli O157. Another five one week old Holstein bull calves, only inoculated with the E. coli O157, served as controls. All calves were necropsied and samples from the gastrointestinal tract were cultured. Dexamethasone treated calves shed at higher levels on days four and seven post-inoculation, but not thereafter. The data from this study suggest that there may be a time dependent correlation between dexamethasone immunosuppression and the concentration of E. coli O157 an animal will shed in the feces and that transient immunosuppression does not result in prolonged shedding of E. coli O157.&#xd;
The goal of the second study was to determine whether calves immunosuppressed by persistent infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) will shed E. coli O157 at a higher level and for a longer duration than a normal animal. Nine six to eight week old calves persistently infected with non-cytopathic BVDV and eight normal calves obtained from separate cow-calf operations were orally inoculated with 109 CFU of a mixture five nalidixic-acid resistant strains of E. coli O157. All calves were necropsied and samples from the gastrointestinal tract cultured. There was no statistical difference in the concentration of E. coli O157 shed or the duration of shedding between the persistently infected BVDV calves and the control calves throughout the length of the study. The data suggest that immunosuppression caused by persistent infection with non-cytopathic BVDV infection does not play a role in the level or duration of shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in calves.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Translocations are a useful management tool for restoring wildlife species to their native ranges, but require post-release monitoring to determine project success. We report results of a 4-year effort to reestablish a breeding population of Evermann's Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus evermanni) on Agattu Island in the Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska. This endemic subspecies of ptarmigan was extirpated from most of the Near Islands by introductions of arctic fox by fur traders, and natural recolonizations did not occur after fox eradication. All females surviving the 2-week post-release period attempted to nest but initiated clutches later in the season and laid fewer eggs than resident females. Nest success was similar for resident and translocated females. Brood survival was greater for translocated than resident females and differed significantly; however, brood survival varied among years and was reduced by adverse weather conditions in 2006. Seasonal survival of radio-marked birds during the breeding season was 100% for translocated and resident ptarmigan. Over-winter mortality resulted in a low return rate in 2006. Returning birds in 2006 showed strong site fidelity and nest locations in two consecutive years were closely spaced.&#xd;
We examined nest site selection and determined brood movements and home range size of recently translocated and resident females. Nest sites of translocated females averaged 4.2 km from their respective release location and were not different from nest locations of resident females with regard to topographical features. Female nest site selection was influenced by percent composition of rock and forb coverage but was unaffected by slope, aspect, or general habitat. Broods of both resident and translocated females made movements to higher elevations after hatching. While size of brood home range was similar for resident and translocated females, distances traveled between the nest site and the arithmetic center of the brood home range were greater for translocated females. Overall, we conclude that translocations are an effective technique for reestablishing island populations of Rock Ptarmigan. Our study provides successful methods which may benefit future projects to reestablish endemic populations of ptarmigan and landbirds elsewhere in the Aleutian Islands.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The goal of this research is to develop methods and tools for generating flight plans for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  A method of generating flight plans is needed to describe data collection missions, such as taking aerial photographs.  The flight plans are two-dimensional and exist in a plane a fixed distance above the Earth.  Since the flight areas are typically small, the Earth's curvature is not accounted for in flight plan generation.  Designed to completely cover a specified field area, the plans consist of a series of line and arc segments and are described in a format that is recognized by the Piccolo autopilot used by the Kansas State University Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) Lab.  Grids are designed to cover the field area, and turn maneuvers are designed to ensure efficient flight plans.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The flight plan generation process is broken into several parts.  Once a field area is defined, path lines covering this area are calculated.  Optimal turn maneuvers are calculated to smoothly connect the path lines in a continuous flight plan.  Two methods of determining path line order are discussed.  One method flies the lines in the order that they are arranged spatially; the other method decides line order by calculating the shortest turn maneuver to another path line.  After the flight plan is generated, a text file is created in a format that is readable for the autopilot.  In order to easily generate flight plans, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been created.  This GUI allows a user to easily generate a flight plan without modifying any code.  The flight plan generation software is used to build example flight plans for this thesis.  These flight plans were flown with an UAV and test results are presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aquifers are frequently contaminated by phenolic compounds from spills, leaking underground storage tanks, or landfills. These compounds can be toxic to a variety of organisms including humans. Their disposal is restricted in many countries with strict limits for acceptable concentrations in drinking water. Phenols that are chlorinated have significantly greater toxicity and are resistant to aerobic biodegradation. Enzyme-mediated in situ stabilization has been advocated as an approach for the treatment of phenolic compounds in soils and groundwater. This research investigated the applicability of a luminol-based chemiluminescence assay to monitor transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme in saturated porous media. The chemiluminescence assay was optimized by varying solution conditions such as the concentration of luminol, p-iodophenol, hydrogen peroxide, ionic strength and pH. All assay components were found to affect the maximum chemiluminescene intensity. The study also evaluated the ability of HRP to mediate the removal of phenol from solution by catalyzing its oxidative polymerization in simulated aquifer conditions. HRP behaved as a conservative tracer in the column packed with Ottawa sand. The concentration of phenol in the column effluent was found to decrease by nearly 90% in the presence of HRP and H2O2 in the continuous flow system. HRP mediated oxidative polymerization of phenols resulted in the production of soluble and insoluble oligomeric products. Modification of porous media caused by the deposition of phenol polymerization products was studied and the impact of media modification on subsequent transport of phenolic contaminants was evaluated using 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) as a probe solute. The pore volume of the porous media was reduced due to the deposition of insoluble phenolic oligomers. The transport behavior of 2,4-DCP showed that the contaminant was retarded in the modified porous media.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A computational system is built for conducting deterministic simulations of three-dimensional multiple scattering of elastic waves by spherical inclusions. &#xd;
&#xd;
Based on expansion expression of elastic wave fields in terms of scalar and vector spherical harmonics, analytically exact solutions of single scattering and multiple scattering are obtained, implemented and verified. The verification is done by using continuities of displacement and surface traction at the interface between an inclusion and host medium, energy conservation and published results. &#xd;
&#xd;
The scatterer polymerization methodology is extended to three-dimensional multiple scattering solution. By using this methodology, an assemblage of actual scatterers can be treated as an abstract scatterer. This methodology is verified by using different approaches, with or without scatterer polymerization, to solve a physically the same multiple scattering problem.  &#xd;
&#xd;
As an application example, band gap formation process for elastic wave propagation in cubic lattice arrangements of spherical scatterers is observed through a series of numerical simulations. Along the direction of the incident wave, scatterer arrangements are viewed as comprising layers of scatterers, within which scatterers form a square grid. Starting from one layer and by increasing the number of layers, near-field forward wave propagation spectra are computed as the number of layers increases. These simulations also demonstrates that the computational system has the capability to simulate multiple scattering solutions of elastic waves in three-dimension.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Foods with high fiber can reduce calorie uptake and provide health benefits related to chronic ailments like obesity, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, inclusion of fiber diminishes the final product quality and consumer acceptability of cereal products. The overall objective of this project was to produce fiber-enriched, pre-cooked wheat flours using extrusion processing in order to enhance their nutritional value, while maintaining functional and sensory properties in baked products such as cookies and tortillas. In the first part of this study, extrusion processing was utilized to pre-cook wheat flours substituted with 0, 10, 20 and 30 % wheat bran in order to enhance their rheological properties and functionality with regards to cookies and tortillas. Two extrusion conditions, low-temperature-low-shear (LTLS) and high-temperature-high-shear (HTHS) were studied for pre-cooking the flours. Results showed that for all flours, as % bran increased, RVA peak viscosity (PV), and mixograph peak time (PTM) and peak height (PH) decreased. At all bran levels, PV and PH were significantly lower for pre-cooked flours as compared to uncooked. As the percent bran increased, the quality of cookies (weight and spread factor) and tortillas (specific volume, rollability and extensibility) deteriorated for both uncooked and pre-cooked wheat flours. In the second part of this study, effect of extrusion pre-cooking on the dietary fiber profile of wheat flour substituted with 0, 10, 20 and 30 % wheat bran was evaluated. Pre-cooking by extrusion significantly increased SDF in flours (by 22 to 59 %), although in most cases it also led to a significant decrease in TDF. Cookies and tortillas, produced from uncooked and pre-cooked flours with 0 and 20% substituted bran, were evaluated for consumer acceptability using a 9-point hedonic scale. Organoleptic properties of cookies from uncooked flour did not change significantly with increase in bran substitution from 0 to 20%. However, consumer ratings for tortillas did decrease slightly but significantly with increase in bran level. To summarize, pre-cooking of the flours using extrusion did not improve the sensory properties of cookies and tortillas, although the products were still found acceptable by consumers and also contained higher soluble fiber.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Integral Abutment Bridges (IABs) are Jointless Bridges whereby the deck is continuous and monolithic with abutment walls. IABs are outperforming their non-integral counterparts in economy and safety. Their principal advantages are derived from the absence of expansion joints and sliding bearings in the deck, making them the most cost-effective system in terms of construction, maintenance, and longevity. The main purpose of constructing IABs is to prevent the corrosion of structure due to water seepage through joints. The simple and rapid construction provides smooth, uninterrupted deck that is aesthetically pleasing and safer for riding. The single structural unit increases the degree of redundancy enabling higher resistance to extreme events. &#xd;
&#xd;
However, the design of IABs not being an exact science poses certain critical issues. The continuity achieved by this construction results in thermally induced deformations. These in turn introduce a significantly complex and nonlinear soil-structure interaction into the response of abutment walls and piles of the IAB. The unknown soil response and its effect on the stresses in the bridge, creates uncertainties in the design. &#xd;
To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of load transfer due to thermal expansion, which is also dependent on the type of the soil adjacent to the abutment walls and piles, a 3D finite element analysis is carried out on a representative IAB using state-of-the-art finite element code ABAQUS/Standard 6.5-1. A literature review focusing on past numerical models of IABs is presented followed by details of the numerical model developed in this study using the interactive environment ABAQUS/CAE 6.5-1 along with the analysis details. A discussion of results for the analysis of the IAB with three different soil conditions and each experiencing three different temperature change scenarios is presented. Conclusions of the study and recommendations for future research wrap up the thesis. The advancement of knowledge enabled by this research will provide a basis for introduction of new guidelines in Kansas Bridge Design Manual.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fluid raw milk has become one of the largest agricultural commodities, as measured by gross sales, produced in the United States.  Since the federal government began to loosen its control over dairy prices in the early 1980’s, farm level milk prices have seen dramatic increases in volatility.  Further, shrinking profit margins are requiring more and more dairy farmers to carry a significant amount of debt.  Because of the greater leverage in the industry and reduced government support, many producers desire to find mechanisms by which to reduce price risk.&#xd;
Class III milk futures began trading in 1996 with an objective to provide dairy industry players with a means to reduce price risk by transferring that risk to other market players or speculators.  Numerous strategies have been proposed for dairy producers to use in price risk reduction that industry participants both support and denounce.  One of the objectives of this thesis was to list and analyze a select number of these strategies for their risk-reducing features.  Many of these systematic strategies result in lower risk, but the mean Class III price that results from their use was significantly different depending on the strategy used.&#xd;
Another objective of this thesis was to develop a model-based hedging strategy for Class III milk.  Six models were developed to predict the Class III Milk price six months and three months into the future.  The results of these models were then compared to the Class III Futures price being offered on the first trading day of the month, six months and three months prior to the production month to be priced.  If the futures price was higher, a hedge was initiated.  If the futures price was lower, no hedge was initiated and the cash market was used. &#xd;
The decision models developed and tested in this thesis not only reduced price volatility, they also increased the mean Class III price obtained as compared to a “cash-only” strategy.  While the decision models were successful in-sample, their out-of-sample testing proved to be considerably less successful as all of the model-based strategies underperformed the cash market. &#xd;
The final area researched by this thesis was that of milk price basis.  Basis, as it concerns milk prices, is extremely difficult to predict since it involves both physical milk characteristics and government controlled pricing components.  While the predictive models tested gave insight into basis prediction, a clear predictive basis model was not found.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Field experiments were conducted near Manhattan, KS in 2005 and 2006 and Sabetha, KS in 2005 to determine the efficacy of S-metolachlor tank mixed with fomesafen on common waterhemp in soybean. Preemergence treatments included S-metolachlor + fomesafen at 0.91 + 0.22, 1.21 + 0.28, 1.52 + 0.36, and 1.82 + 0.43 kg ha-1 and S-metolachlor + metribuzin at 0.55 + 0.14 kg ha-1. These treatments were applied alone or followed by a postemergence glyphosate application at 0.88 kg ha-1. Ratings were taken 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. The study showed that S-metolachlor + fomesafen gave excellent early season control of common waterhemp at both Sabetha and Manhattan. S-metolachlor + fomesafen at the 1.52+0.36 kg ha-1 rate gave greater weed control than S-metolachlor + metribuzin. A separate study was conducted to determine the competitiveness and fitness of a protox-resistant common waterhemp biotype. Protox-resistant and protox-susceptible biotypes of common waterhemp were grown under noncompetitive and competitive arrangements in the greenhouse. In the noncompetitive study a single plant of both biotypes was planted in 15-cm-diam pots. Photosynthesis, leaf area, and plant biomass were measured 10, 20, 30, and 40 day after transplanting (DATP). In general, photosynthesis rate and plant biomass was similar between biotypes. However, the protox-resistant biotype had higher leaf area then the susceptible biotype at 20, 30, and 40 DATP.&#xd;
Under competitive conditions, a replacement series study, photosynthesis, leaf area, plant height, and plant biomass were measured 7, 14, 21, and 28 DATP. In general protox-resistant and –susceptible common waterhemp values were similar 28 DATP.&#xd;
Relative crowding coefficient values 28 DATP were 0.86, 0.89, 1.09, and 1.13 for photosynthesis, leaf area, plant height, and plant biomass, respectively. Suggesting, protox resistance did not change the ability of common waterhemp to grow normally under competitive conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Plant defense responses are constitutively activated in the Arabidopsis thaliana ssi2 mutant plant.  In addition, the ssi2 mutant allele confers a dwarf phenotype.  The SSI2 gene encodes a stearoyl-ACP-desaturase, which converts stearic acid (18:0) to oleic acid (18:1), suggesting a role for lipids in plant defense.  Microarray analysis identified several genes which encode putative acyl hydrolases/lipases that are expressed at elevated levels in the leaves of ssi2, in comparison to the wild type plant.  One gene in particular, At5g14180, was expressed at 60-fold greater level in ssi2 than in the wild type plant.  To study the involvement of At5g14180 in plant defense and lipid metabolism, two transgenic lines containing T-DNA insertions within the At5g14180 gene were identified.  These two T-DNA insertional alleles of the At5g14180 gene attenuate the ssi2-conferred heightened resistance to a virulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola in the ssi2 At5g14180 double mutant plant.  Furthermore, pathogen growth was enhanced in the At5g14180 single mutant plants, as compared to the wild type plant.   Profiling of lipid composition in leaf tissue identified changes in the lipid composition between the At5g14180 mutant and wild type plants, suggesting that the At5g14180 encoded protein may impact lipid metabolism in Arabidopsis leaves.</dc:description>

<dc:description>While plants are typically exposed to multiple stressors in the field, studies of genome-wide gene expression and phytohormone responses in wild plant species exposed to multiple stressors are rare. Our objectives were to determine the effects of drought and rust stress on gene expression in Andropogon gerardii, the dominant grass in tallgrass prairie, and associated levels of phytohormone production. In a factorial design, plants experiencing drought or non-drought conditions were either inoculated with the rust pathogen Puccinia andropogonis or not inoculated. Gene expression was evaluated with maize microarrays.  Drought-stressed plants significantly decreased expression of genes associated with photosynthesis and the hypersensitive response, while expression of genes associated with chaperones and heat-shock proteins increased.   No significant differences in gene expression in response to the rust treatment were detected using a mixed model analysis of variance and false discovery rate protection, probably because of the low infection rate.  Phytohormone production increased when both stresses were present.  The rust treatment significantly increased benzoic acid (BA) production in the presence of drought, while the drought treatment alone significantly increased salicylic acid (SA) production.  Leaf tips usually had higher levels of all phytohormones in all treatments and the leaf section evaluated had a larger effect on phytohormone level than did the treatments applied.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation consists of three chapters. Chapter one presents a theoretical model using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) approach to investigate the role of world oil prices in explaining the business cycle in Saudi Arabia. This model incorporates both productivity and oil revenue shocks. The results indicate that productivity shocks are relatively more important to business cycles than oil shocks. However, this model has some unfavorable features that are associated with both investment and labor hours. &#xd;
The second chapter presents a modified theoretical model using DSGE approach to examine the role of world oil prices versus productivity shocks in explaining the business cycles in Saudi Arabia. To overcome the unfavorable features of the baseline model, the alternative model adds friction to the model by incorporating investment portfolio adjustment. Thus, the alternative model produces similar dynamics to that of the baseline model but the unfavorable characteristics are eliminated.  Also, this chapter conducts sensitivity analysis.&#xd;
The objective of the third chapter is to empirically investigate how real world oil price and productivity shocks affect output, consumption, investment, labor hours, and trade balance/output ratio for Saudi Arabia. This chapter complements the theoretical model of the previous chapters. In addition, this study builds a foundation for future studies in examining the impact of real world oil price shocks on the economies of key trade partners of Saudi Arabia. &#xd;
The results of the third chapter show that productivity shocks matter more for macroeconomic fluctuations than oil shocks for the Saudis’ primary trade partners. Therefore, fears of oil importing countries appear to be overstated. &#xd;
As a whole, this research is important for the following reasons. First, the empirical model is consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model in that productivity is a driving force of business cycles in Saudi Arabia. Second, the policymakers in Saudi Arabia should be more concerned with increasing productivity through adopting new technologies that increase economic prosperity. Therefore, the policymakers should continue diversifying economic resources and reduce their reliance on oil.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was designed to explore the measurement and application of brand personality congruence (BPC), defined as the gap between the customer’s own personality and a restaurant’s brand personality as perceived by the customer.  The study involved two phases:  Phase I primarily focused on the development of the BPC scale based on the existing Brand Personality Scale (Aaker 1997), while Phase II involved testing the relationship between BPC and brand loyalty and the mediating effects of satisfaction and trust on that relationship. Both Phases used the online survey methodology for data collection. &#xd;
Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the dimensionality of brand personality. The five-factor solution was supported with the dimensions of sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness.   Exploratory factor analysis showed that brand personality dimensions were not stable for measuring customer personality.   Only characteristics most closely associated with the Big Five dimensions of agreeableness, extroversion, and conscientiousness significantly loaded on the customer personality scale.  A confirmatory factor analysis of the reduced scale resulted in a 5-factor solution: successful, exciting, unique, sincere, and friendly.   Because BPC was operationalized as the gap between the customer’s perceived personality and the restaurant’s brand personality as perceived by the customer, only indicators that were common between the two scales were used to establish the 17-item BPC scale consisting of the following dimensions:  exciting, unique, sincere, and leader. &#xd;
In Phase II, second-order structural equation modeling was used to test BPC as an antecedent of the post-purchase evaluations of trust, satisfaction, and brand loyalty.  Results indicated strong positive relationships, which suggested that higher congruence with the brand’s personality results in increased trust, satisfaction, and brand loyalty.  BPC had the greatest direct effect on trust and also had indirect effects on satisfaction via trust and brand loyalty via trust and satisfaction. Additional analyses showed that trust and satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between BPC and brand loyalty.  Trust also mediated the relationship between BPC and satisfaction.   Results implied that as the restaurant brand earns a customer’s trust over time, the customer’s evaluation of overall satisfaction with the brand also increases and leads to stronger brand loyalty.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis analyses the economics of reduced tillage farming compared to no-till on a western Kansas farm using elevated crop residue levels and higher intensity opportunity cropping strategies to overcome obstacles.  Farming expenses are from the author’s farm.  Crop yields and rainfall data come from the Tribune Unit of the KSU-Southwest Research-Extension Center.  Price and crop insurance data are from USDA sources on the Internet.&#xd;
Crop enterprise budgets are used to determine per acre expenses, net revenue, and the risks of high cropping intensity no-till (NT), and reduced tillage (RT), eco-fallow and with and without opportunity cropping.  Grain sorghum was added to the NT rotation, the RT opportunity cropping and the NT opportunity cropping to potentially increase revenues and compete against perennial grasses.  However, grain sorghum revenues for various reasons did not cover average variable costs.&#xd;
Results indicate that NT opportunity cropping can be as or more profitable than RT eco-fallow using corn, however risks and expenses are greater.  Over the 10-year study, the NT opportunity cropping averaged $3.97 more net revenue than the RT rotation. The NT rotation averaged $5.40 less net revenue than the RT rotation.   The RT opportunity cropping averaged $3.83 less net revenue than the RT rotation.  The NT opportunity cropping produced the highest net revenue, followed by the RT rotation.  The RT opportunity produced the third highest net revenue and the NT rotation produce the lowest net revenue.  The RT rotation showed relatively little risk in the ability to recover variable expenses. &#xd;
These results only apply to this farm and should be extrapolated to other regions only after study and analysis.  This case study is not necessary applicable to other farms.  However, the ideas and analytical techniques may be used to address similar issues on other farms.  &#xd;
This analysis reveals that higher intensity no-till cropping can increase net revenues as long as intensity is decreased when soil moisture at planting is not adequate.  This allows farmers to benefit from increases in soil organic matter and decreases in soil erosion from no-till farming.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The production of corn-based ethanol in the U.S. has increased from 1,630 million gallons in 2000 to 4,855 million gallons in 2006, representing a 198% growth over the period considered. This growth is favored by the availability of more efficient technologies in the production process of ethanol and is sustained by the high prices of ethanol in the market. The industry is also supported by a favorable public policy, expressed in the form of laws, mandating an increase in the use of ethanol, and also in the form of tax incentives. The tremendous increase in the use of corn for the ethanol industry is made at the expense of the livestock industry that was the traditional destination for much of the U.S. corn grain. As the ethanol industry continues to expand, concerns are raised in regard to its impact as more and more corn is diverted from the livestock sector. This study investigates the economic impact of the ethanol industry on the U.S. livestock sector. Specifically, a shipping cost model is developed to simulate the impact of the ethanol industry on the shipping cost of corn at the national and individual state levels. The dynamics for major livestock producing states are also analyzed at the crop reporting district level. Different scenarios based on assumptions on the availability of corn and the production capacities of the ethanol industry are displayed.&#xd;
Results from the model indicate that nationwide there is a 5 to 22% increase in the shipping cost of corn for the livestock industry due to the ethanol industry, depending on the scenario involved. At the state level, there is an increase in the transportation cost for most of the states, with shipping cost doubling in some cases. Nevertheless, some states benefit from the&#xd;
dynamics created by the development of ethanol plants and are experiencing a reduction in their livestock industry corn transportation cost.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Herbivory is one of the major biotic interactions shaping the structure and dynamics of grassland plant populations and community structure. The two major grass growth forms, rhizomatous and caespitose species, may show different grazing tolerance and short-term overcompensation may offset long-term reductions in plant performance and fitness. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) the effects of long-term ungulate grazing on plant architecture, population structure, and life history traits of the caespitose perennial grass, Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem), and the rhizomatous Bouteloua curtipendula (sideoats grama) in tallgrass prairie, and 2) the effects of grazing intensity (frequency of defoliation) on growth responses of little bluestem. Long-term bison grazing decreased the cover, frequency, tiller height, and proportion of tillers producing seed in little bluestem, but caused no changes in tiller density and total genet size. Grazed little bluestem plants maintained a significantly larger below ground bud bank. Bison grazing had no long-term effect on the abundance, bud bank densities, or rhizome growth of the rhizomatous side-oats grama grass. Biomass, tiller density, relative growth rates, and proportion of tillers flowering in little bluestem all decreased with increasing frequency of defoliation. However, even an intense grazing regime (9 defoliations over a 12 month period) caused no plant mortality and no changes in new tiller emergence rates, or bud bank densities. Increasing defoliation frequency did result in shifts in plant architecture, as an increasing proportion of extravaginal tillers led to a more lateral, decumbent growth form.&#xd;
These results show that the rhizomatous side-oats grama grass has a significantly higher grazing tolerance than does little bluestem, and/or that bison selectively graze little bluestem. Results from responses to the experimental defoliation regimes suggest that little bluestem shows&#xd;
lower tolerance to high frequency of defoliation, and its maintenance of a reserve below ground bud bank may be its primary tolerance mechanism, allowing tiller populations to recover following severe defoliation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Within the field of medicine and clinical/counseling psychology, there has been an overabundance of research and literature devoted to specific areas of focus such as trainee impairment, remediation, and dismissal procedures. Although literature does exist in relation to the specific types of remediation methods being used by graduate training programs, no research to date, however, has addressed what types of remediation methods would be most effective in response to the various types of impairment experienced by therapists-in-training (Russell &amp; Peterson, 2003; Forrest et al., 1997). Using a modified version of the Delphi method, the present study seeks to bridge this existing gap by exploring the types of remediation methods deemed most effective for the specific types of impairment experienced by trainees within master’s and doctoral level accredited Marriage and Family Therapy graduate training programs. &#xd;
The purpose of the study was to answer the following questions: &#xd;
1. What, given a list of impairments and &#xd;
   remediation methods would, supervisors &#xd;
   and/or professors within MFT graduate &#xd;
   training programs list as the most &#xd;
   effective type of remediation method for &#xd;
   a specific type of impairment? &#xd;
2. Given the initial answers of experts, &#xd;
   once they are provided the answers from &#xd;
   their colleagues, can they come to a &#xd;
   greater consensus about the most &#xd;
   effective remediation methods for &#xd;
   specific types of impairment? &#xd;
     Those remediation methods chosen by panelists that had a median of 6.00 to 7.00&#xd;
and interquartile range of 0.00 to 1.50 made the final profile. Results indicated that, given the initial answers of experts, the panel of experts was able to reach a greater consensus about which types of remediation methods they deemed most effective in responding to the corresponding types of impairment. Furthermore, during the first phase of questioning, the panel of experts also generated relevant commentaries with regard to responding to student impairment. Finally, limitations and directions for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, a vortex particle method is used to simulate incompressible vortical flows, specifically aircraft wake vortices. This is particularly suitable for a wake vortex system that is slowly varying in the axial direction and has a high Reynolds number and low Mach number. The flow field, in the form of vorticity, is employed as the source in the far-field acoustic calculation using a vortex sound formula that enables computation of acoustic signals radiated from an approximated incompressible flow field.&#xd;
In a two-dimensional vortex system, the stretching effect in the axial direction is neglected. The purpose of this study is to focus on vortex core behaviors. A numerical simulation is performed in a more realistic wake consisting of a counter-rotating vortex pair with inviscid ground effects and shear flows. A Kirchhoff spinning-core vortex model is thus used as a starting point. &#xd;
In a vortex system with multiple vortices, such as a complicated aircraft vortex wake vortices, the sound emission frequency of the unsteady vortex core is subjected to change because of interactions between multiple vortices. The behaviors of the influence, indicated by the ratio between the core size and the distance of the vortices, are investigated as well as the underlining vortex core dynamic mechanisms. Cases of co-rotating vortices and a multiple-vortex system composed of two counter-rotating vortex pairs are studied for applications to aircraft wake vortex sound. &#xd;
In three-dimensional vortices, sinusoidal instabilities, which occur in the axial direction at various length scales, result in significant flow structure changes in these vortices, and thus influence their radiated acoustic signals. Cases of vortex rings and a pair of counter-rotating vortices are studied when they are undergoing both long-wave and short-wave instabilities. Both inviscid and viscous interactions are considered and the effects of turbulence are simulated using sub-grid-scale models. A higher peak frequency than the Kirchhoff frequency appears due to the straining field caused by mutual perturbation, under both long-wave and short-wave instabilities. Vortices with the initial core vorticity of the Gaussian distribution and the elliptic distribution are also studied.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Over the past two decades meshless methods have attracted much attention owing to their advantages in adaptivity, higher degree of solution field continuity, and capability to handle moving boundary and changing geometry. In this work, a meshless integral method based on the regularized boundary integral equation has been developed and applied to two-dimensional linear elasticity and elastoplasticity with small or large deformation. &#xd;
The development of the meshless integral method and its application to two-dimensional linear elasticity is described first. The governing integral equation is obtained from the weak form of elasticity over a local sub-domain, and the moving least-squares approximation is employed for meshless function approximation. This formulation incorporates: a subtraction method for singularity removal in the boundary integral equation, a special numerical integration for the calculation of integrals with weak singularity which further improves accuracy, a collocation method for the imposition of essential boundary conditions, and a method for incorporation of natural boundary conditions in the system governing equation. Next, elastoplastic material behavior with small deformation is introduced into the meshless integral method. The constitutive law is rate-independent flow theory based on von Mises yielding criterion with isotropic hardening. The method is then extended to large deformation plasticity based on Green-Naghdi’s theory using updated Lagrangian description. The Green-Lagrange strain is decomposed into the elastic and plastic part, and the elastoplastic constitutive law is employed that relates the Green-Lagrange strain to the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Finally, a pre- and post-processor for the meshless method using node- and pixel-based approach is presented. Numerical results from the meshless integral method agree well with available analytical solutions or finite element results, and the comparisons demonstrate that the meshless integral method is accurate and robust. This research lays the foundation for modeling and simulation of metal cutting processes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objective of this project is to build an e-commerce website using ASP.NET as well as J2EE technologies. Visual Studio 2005 provides a great IDE to build seamless front end layer for the websites with minimum effort. Hence, it is used to build the presentation layer.  The business logic layer is developed in ASP.NET 2.0 and J2EE, exposing the functions as web services.  Two similar clients have been developed in ASP.NET.  These two clients invoke the .NET and J2EE web services.&#xd;
&#xd;
The two similar websites are subjected to testing for correctness and performance. Stress and load testing is performed thoroughly on the website. A detailed analysis of the results is done using the response times and throughputs from various tests. &#xd;
&#xd;
This report proves that we can build a website using a presentation tier developed in ASP.NET consuming any of the two technologies’ (ASP.NET &amp; J2EE) web services.  This proves to be very useful in scenarios where we need the best overall user experience regardless of the technology, to replace or extend an existing business tier by using a different technology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In commercial bakeries, the baker expects to get the same bread loaf, including weight&#xd;
and size, after sheeting the same size dough piece. Doughs made from different flours have&#xd;
different elastic recoveries to a great extent, which has an effect on the dough’s size and density. &#xd;
Products made from differently elastic doughs can’t have the same shape and height. Weight&#xd;
may also be affected.&#xd;
&#xd;
The dough rheological behaviors of five flours and their blends having different chemical and physical properties were measured as were changes in thickness and snapback (thickness of the machined dough sheet relative to the roll gap) immediately following sheeting. Dough snapback was determined to be a function of both processing parameters, reduction ratio, and&#xd;
dough rest time, as well as different flour properties. The predication equation for dough snapback is based on multiple flour properties and sheeting conditions.&#xd;
&#xd;
Among the variables, Mixograph work, reduction ratio, and dough rest time were the&#xd;
main factors affecting the elastic characteristics of the doughs. Minimum snapback occurred with the weakest flour experiencing the longest rest time and the smallest reduction ratio. A 7-factor equation was found to be robust to predict the snapback of several flours, by combining&#xd;
Mixograph work, reduction ratio, dough rest time, Mixograph peak height and mixing time,&#xd;
Alveograph P/L, and protein content.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Aboveground and belowground food webs are linked by plants, but their reciprocal influences are seldom studied.  Because phosphorus (P) is the primary nutrient associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, and evidence suggests it may be more limiting than nitrogen (N) for some insect herbivores, assessing carbon (C):N:P stoichiometry will enhance my ability to discern trophic interactions. The objective of this research was to investigate functional linkages between aboveground and belowground invertebrate populations and communities and to identify potential mechanisms regulating these interactions using a C:N:P stoichiometric framework.  Specifically, I examine (1) long-term grasshopper community responses to three large-scale drivers of grassland ecosystem dynamics, (2) food selection by the mixed-feeding grasshopper Melanoplus bivittatus, (3) the mechanisms for nutrient regulation by M. bivittatus, (4) food selection by fungivorous Collembola, and (5) the effects of C:N:P on invertebrate community composition and aboveground-belowground food web linkages.  In my analysis of grasshopper community responses to fire, bison grazing, and weather over 25 years, I found that all three drivers affected grasshopper community dynamics, most likely acting indirectly through effects on plant community structure, composition and nutritional quality.  In a field study, the diet of M. bivittatus was dominated by forbs with grasses constituting only a minor fraction of their diet under ambient soil conditions, but grass consumption approximately doubled as a result of changes in grass C:N:P.  M. bivittatus was found to rely primarily on selective consumption of foods with varying nutritional quality, rather than compensatory feeding or altering post-ingestive processes, to maintain C:N homeostasis in a laboratory experiment.  In a soil-based mesocosm study, I show that Collembola feed on both saprophytic and AM fungi, in some cases exhibiting a slight preference for AM fungi.  In the final study, although I did not find the expected indirect relationship between soil Collembola and aboveground herbivory as mediated through host plant quality, there were significant effects of root C:N and AM colonization on Collembola density and of plant C:N on aboveground herbivory.  Overall, this research shows that host plant C:N:P stoichiometry can influence both above- and belowground invertebrate population, community, and food web dynamics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida and Panonychus citri (McGregor) are the two major arachnid pests of screenhouse-cultivated papayas in Taiwan. Control of these mites has become more difficult because both pests have become resistant to most registered miticides. This laboratory study investigated the feeding behaviors, predatory potential, and prey preference of a domesticated line of Mallada basalis Walker, a commonly-occurring chrysopid in Taiwan, to both of these pest mites. A laboratory assessment on control efficacies of different predator:prey release ratios to single and mixed-pest species was also conducted. Behavioral study showed that all larval stages of M. basalis exhibited a high rate of acceptance of all life stages of both T. kanzawai and P. citri. Second and third instar predators foraged actively during most of the 2-h tests. Numbers and rates of prey consumption were measured for each instar of predator and prey.  Results showed that consumption increased and prey handling time decreased as predator life stage advanced, and prey stage decreased. Mallada basalis exhibited both a shorter handling time and corresponding higher consumption rate on P. citri compared with T. kanzawai. Handling time and consumption rate also were positively affected by increasing prey density. Mallada basalis did not exhibit notable species or life stage preferences, and prior feeding experience on one mite species did not affect subsequent prey choice between the two mites. Lacewings significantly reduced T. kanzawai and P. citri populations at a predator:prey ratio of 1:30 and this improved at ratios of 1:15 and 1:10. Control of T. kanzawai was slightly better than P. citri when the mites occurred singly and together. Consumption by M. basalis increased with temperature up to 30C. I conclude that M. basalis has high potential for augmentative biological control of papaya mites. Further field investigations are needed for making final recommendations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>America is in the midst of an obesity epidemic (Wechsler, McKenna, Lee, &amp; Dietz, 2004).  According to Wechsler et al., physical inactivity is a major contributor to this issue.  Burnette (1999), reports certain behaviors and instructional strategies help teachers to build stronger teaching/learning relationships with students, and that some specific behaviors may be the most influential.  Teacher feedback and teacher proximity are two specific behaviors that are important in a physical education setting.  Hastie (1998) and Lund (1990), report that when physical education teachers provide feedback and maintain proximity to students, learning may be enhanced.&#xd;
	This study examined the frequency of teacher feedback and teacher proximity in relation to student body mass index (BMI) and student gender.  Fifteen Kansas middle school physical education teachers were observed delivering skill based lessons to two classes of students.  Event recording, a form of systematic observation, was used in data collection.  A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted with independent samples T-tests conducted for specific demographic data.  &#xd;
Results indicated no significant differences in the frequency of teacher feedback and teacher proximity in relation to student body mass index (BMI) or student gender.  Results of the analysis of various pieces of demographic information showed teachers who use some of the Physical Focus Curriculum activities had a higher rate per minute of teacher feedback than teachers who use none of the curriculum.  Analysis also showed that teachers using more individualized skill based activities provided significantly higher rates of feedback and proximity than those conducting large group activities.  Further analysis of demographic data revealed those teachers currently coaching a sport provided less feedback and proximity to students in class than those not currently coaching.  Membership in the state professional organization did not have any effect upon rates of teacher feedback or proximity.  The effects of teacher gender on rates of feedback and proximity showed female teachers are more proximal to all students than male teachers.  &#xd;
Recommendations to be considered when conducting further research include increasing the sample size, development of more specific instrumentation to measure rates of feedback and proximity in an activity setting, implementing more control of the type of activity and instruction provided, and including more diversity in the study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Most state-of-the-art systems are multidisciplinary in nature and encompass a wide range of components from domains such as electronics, mechanics, hydraulics, etc.  Design considerations and design parameters of the system can come from any or a combination of these domains. The traditional optimization approach for multidisciplinary systems utilizes sequential optimization, wherein each subsystem is optimized in isolation in a predetermined order, assuming that the designs of the other subsystems remain fixed. This often leads to system designs that are suboptimal. In recent years emphasis has been placed on development of an integrated scheme for analysis and design of multidisciplinary systems. An important aspect is the software architecture required to support such a scheme.&#xd;
This dissertation presents MIXEDMODELS (Multidisciplinary Integrated eXtensible Engine for Driving Metamodeling, Optimization and DEsign of Large-scale Systems) - a unified analysis and design tool for multidisciplinary systems that is based on a procedural, symbolic-numeric architecture. This architecture offers great modeling flexibility at the component level, allowing any engineer to add components in his/her domain of expertise to the platform in a modular fashion. The symbolic engine in the MIXEDMODELS platform synthesizes the system governing equations as a unified set of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). These equations are differentiated with respect to design variables to obtain an additional set of DAEs that describe the sensitivity coefficients of the system state variables. This combined set of DAEs is solved numerically to obtain the solution for the state variables and the state sensitivity coefficients of the system. Finally, knowing the system performance functions, their design sensitivity coefficients can be calculated by using the values of the state variables and state sensitivity coefficients obtained from the DAEs. For ease in error control and software implementation, sensitivity analysis formulation described in this work uses direct differentiation approach as opposed to the adjoint variable approach. &#xd;
The MIXEDMODELS capabilities are demonstrated through several numerical examples and the results indicate that the MIXEDMODELS formulation and architecture is effective in terms of accuracy, modeling convenience, computational efficiency, and the ability to simulate the behavior of a general class of multidisciplinary systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The first part of this thesis describes our novel design, test, and  application of our X-ray streak camera to the pulse duration measurement of  soft X-rays. We demonstrated a significant improvement in the resolution of the x-ray streak camera by reducing the electron beam size in the deflection plates. This was accomplished by adding a slit in front of the focusing lens and the deflection plates. The temporal resolution reached 280 fs when the slit width was 5 μm. The camera was operated in an accumulative mode and tested by using a 25 fs laser with 2 kHz repetition rate and 1-2% RMS pulse energy stability. We conclude that deflection aberrations, which limit the resolution of the camera, can be appreciably reduced by eliminating the wide-angle electrons.&#xd;
We also employed the same streak camera to demonstrate that it is capable of measuring the pulse duration of X-rays. We measured the pulse duration of X-rays emitted from Ni-like Ag and Cd grazing-incidence laser to be ~5ps. The measured value agrees with the prediction made by the model and the measurement made by changing the delay as a function of the pulse duration. The streak camera was also tested with various sources of X-ray such as high harmonics generation of soft x-rays from an argon atom using a high power Ti:sapphire laser source of KLS. The result of the measurement manifests its capability for serving as a detector in the study of ultrafast dynamics in the field of physics, chemistry, biology and medical sciences.&#xd;
The second part of this thesis describes our design of a spectrometer to study the effect of the Carrier envelope (CE) phase on polarization gated extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) super-continuum generation. Because the challenge of making single shot experiment possible is to generate a sufficient number of photons, our setup has been built to allow generation of high order harmonics at the maximum phase matched pressure. This is the first time to our knowledge that phase matching in the polarization gating process has been studied so far. We measured the maximum phase matching pressure to be ~ 55 Torr which is the pressure above which quadratic increase in intensity of the high harmonics spectrum ceases to appear. At this pressure the number of photons per laser shot was 104 which is sufficient for measuring the single shot XUV spectrum in the range 34 to 45 eV. The spectral profile was a super-continuum for some shots and discrete high harmonics for other shots. It is believed that the shot to shot variation of the spectra is due to the changes of the carrier envelope phase of the few-cycle laser pulses used for the polarization gating.&#xd;
An improved CE phase stabilization system in KLS further eliminated the statistical noise in our observation by allowing us to integrate data over several laser cycles for each CE phase value. The effect of CE phase on a polarization gated XUV spectrum was tested by changing the CE phase with two different methods. In the first method, the CE phase was changed by changing the thickness of fused silica plates on the beam path, and the result shows the shift in the spectral peak of the XUV when the gate width approached less than one optical cycle. As gate width was made less than half the optical cycle, the spectrum was observed with continuum harmonics separated by π radians. We believe that the presence of continuum and discrete harmonics spectra in the observation is due to single and double attosecond pulses generated in the polarization gating. &#xd;
 In the second method the carrier-envelope phase of pulses from a grating-based chirped pulse amplification laser was varied smoothly to cover a 2π range by controlling the grating separation. The phase is measured simultaneously by an f-to-2f setup and by the variation of XUV spectra from polarization gated high harmonic generation. A very good similarity between the effect of single and double slits in Yong’s experiment and that of CE phase on the XUV spectrum in the polarization gating experiment has been found, giving better agreement with the theory.&#xd;
 The effect of optical properties such as the Gouy phase shift on the polarization gated spectrum has also been studied in the course of investigating the best experimental optimizations to generate the most CE phase sensitive XUV spectrum with less statistical noise. This is the first time to our knowledge experimental study of the effect of the Gouy phase shift on a polarization gated XUV spectrum has been made.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Military maneuvers involve effectively moving soldiers and equipment across&#xd;
training lands, and this often involves crossing streams. Fording of streams by military&#xd;
vehicles poses a potential for degradation of stream habitats through change of bank&#xd;
angle or excess shear of stream banks and the resultant generation of excessive quantities&#xd;
of sediment, possibly exceeding Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) limits for water&#xd;
quality downstream. This study examines the impact of low water fords on stability of six&#xd;
stream reaches at Fort Riley. Streams with constructed low water fords were mapped and&#xd;
classified according to Rosgen Stream Classification System (1996). Results indicate that&#xd;
some of these streams exhibit some level of instability, which includes bed form changes,&#xd;
accelerated stream bank erosion and backwater pool formation in the vicinity of stream&#xd;
crossings. Poorly constructed fords may act as dams disrupting the transport of sediment&#xd;
along the stream reaches, posing a potential shift in stream equilibrium. Another factor&#xd;
contributing to stream instability is sediment generated from upland areas and routed&#xd;
through approach roads leading to stream crossing sites. The sediment deposited into&#xd;
streams at these crossing locations is a water quality concern, and again poses the&#xd;
potential of disrupting stream equilibrium. Field observations indicate that poorly located&#xd;
stream crossings can alter the direction of stream flow, causing bank erosion on areas&#xd;
immediately below stream crossings. This demonstrates the importance of locating&#xd;
stream crossings on stable locations along a stream reach. Some of the stream reaches&#xd;
also show signs of success ional change. These stream changes have direct implications&#xd;
on the low water fords on Fort Riley. As a result of these stream changes, there will be&#xd;
need to constantly modify the designs and construction techniques of the low water fords&#xd;
in order to accommodate changes in stream dimensions, pattern and profile. Finally,&#xd;
criteria for site selection, design and construction of low water fords are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cellular encapsulation is the immune response in which insects protect themselves from multicellular parasites such as nematodes or parasitoids. During an encapsulation episode, certain insect hemocytes become attracted to a foreign invader and aggregate on its surface. In short order, the invading entity will become entrapped within a capsule comprised of thousands of hemocytes, thus rendering the parasite harmless to the insect host. Although the process of cellular encapsulation has been known for a great many years, very little knowledge yet exists regarding the biochemistry underlying capsule formation. It would seem likely that cell surface adhesion proteins mediate this immune response.&#xd;
	In a series of in vivo encapsulation assays in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, a collection of anti-hemocyte monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was screened for their ability to inhibit cellular encapsulation. Two of the mAbs that inhibited this immune response and incidentally specifically bind plasmatocytes, MS13 and MS34, were used to isolate a ≈ 90 kDa protein. Several short peptide sequences contained within this protein were acquired via Edman degradation. Degenerate primers based on two of these peptide sequences and total RNA from M. sexta hemocytes were used to perform RT-PCR and 5´ and 3´ RACE. This resulted in a full-length cDNA sequence of 2426 bp. A 2301 bp open reading frame within this cDNA sequence codes for a protein of 767 residues. This protein, denominated [Beta]Ms1, exhibits significant sequence homology to the [Beta]-subunits of integrins, which are a family of transmembrane, heterodimeric glycoproteins that possess adhesive properties. Analysis of recombinant segments of [Beta]Ms1 showed that the protein produced from the PCR product is the antigen to MS13 and MS34 and that these mAbs bind to the region of the integrin that contains the extracellular binding site. Northern blot analysis of various M. sexta tissues together with immunofluorescence labeling with MS13 and MS34 shows that [Beta]Ms1 is solely expressed in plasmatocytes. The totality of these experiments demonstrates that integrins are essential for the cellular immune response of encapsulation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Outliers in the data impair traditional estimators of location, variance, and regression parameters so researchers tend to look for robust estimators, i.e., estimators that aren’t sensitive to outliers. These robust estimators can tolerate a certain proportion of outliers. Besides robustness, efficiency is another desirable property. Researchers try to find estimators that are efficient under standard conditions and use them when outliers exist in the data. In this study the robustness and efficiency of a class of estimators that we call [subscript n]C[subscript k ]estimators are investigated. Special cases of this method exist in the literature including U and generalized L-statistics. This estimation technique is based on taking all subsamples of size k from a sample of size n, finding the estimator of interest for each subsample, and specifying one of them, typically the median, or a linear combination of  them as the estimator of the parameter of interest. &#xd;
A simulation study is conducted to evaluate these estimators under different distributions with small sample sizes. Estimators of location, scale, linear regression and multiple regression parameters are studied and compared to other estimators existing in the literature. The concept of data depth is used to propose a new type of estimator for the regression parameters in multiple regression.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With advances in micromechanical machining and nanotechnology, the sample volume needed for biological research and other analysis decreases. With small volume, sample-surface interactions including adsorption must be considered. These adsorption effects can be observed by analyzing light reflected from the solid-liquid interface, and the contact angle of a solution on the surface. Presented is the design and construction of an ellipsometer, a device used to analyze light reflected off of a solid-liquid interface to find interfacial properties, including thickness of a thin film formed by adsorption. The taq enzyme is shown to have a large change in contact angle from seventy degrees to about ten degrees over a short (ten minute) time period when placed on an SU-8 substrate, indicating a change in energy at the interface and a large amount of adsorption. Silane substrates are found to produce similar results. Ellipticity of a colloidal gold nanoparticle solution on a glass substrate is also observed, whose results are difficult to interpret due to bulk shifts in the sample. With the ellipsometer running correctly, it can be used for a number of experiments, including spectroscopic ellipsometry and Brewster angle microscopy, with some modifications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Landscapes express much of who we are.  Our history, thoughts, and values are all interwoven into cultural landscape features.  By researching the landscape similarities and dissimilarities on the regional level, geographers are able to learn more about a people's identity.&#xd;
Scattered across the vast expanses of the Northwoods, residents and visitors alike are greeted by representations of a lumberjack and his blue ox.  In addition to large statues of Paul Bunyan and the Blue Ox, festivals, sporting events, businesses, and public lands are all named in honor of the two folk giants.  These features are so prevalent and well known that references to the region by those who live outside the Northwoods often begin by acknowledging the folk heroes.&#xd;
This study explains the relationship between Paul Bunyan and the Northwoods region.  Focusing on the area of northern Minnesota between the towns of Bemidji and Brainerd, qualitative research methods were conducted over a four-year period (2004-2007) to better understand the phenomena.&#xd;
Since the 1930s, residents of the Northwoods have used Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox landscape features to celebrate symbolically the region’s golden age of logging.  These representations have evolved over the years to include both public and private landscape features.  Given the level of permanence of many of the items as well as the authenticity, popularity, and attachment local residents express towards Paul and Babe, cultural landscape features of the lumberjack and his blue ox will continue to be seen as an integral component of the Northwoods regional identity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Traditionally, growers spray uniform application of pesticides over the target area regardless of variations in pest infestations. In recent years, variable rate application (VRA) technologies have made it possible to apply pesticides in variable rates across the field. In pesticide application, nozzles play a vital role. In general, pesticides are applied using conventional nozzles. Most conventional nozzles vary flow rates only over a 2:1 range when operated within the recommended pressure range due to a fixed spray orifice. Conventional nozzles vary droplet sizes tremendously when there are speed and application rate changes which results in inefficient application. Conventional nozzles have limitations when used for VRA. &#xd;
&#xd;
 A new nozzle called Varitarget nozzle (U.S. Patent No. 5,134,961) was developed and marketed by Bui, (2005) to overcome the limitations with conventional nozzles. Varitarget nozzles have a variable orifice that changes in size in response to pressure changes, allowing varying flow rates with a minimal change in droplet size.  Laboratory tests and field tests were conducted to study the performance of Varitarget nozzle. Varitarget black/blue and clear/yellow caps were evaluated in this study. &#xd;
&#xd;
Lab studies were conducted to measure Varitarget characteristics compared to conventional nozzles. The flow rate ratios of Varitarget nozzle black and clear caps were 12:1 and 10:1 while the conventional nozzles produced flow rate ratios ranging from only 3:1 to 4:1. The measured flow rate of Varitarget nozzle black and clear caps was similar to that published by the manufacturer up to 40 psi and varied higher after 40 psi. Both Varitarget black and clear cap nozzle was within the standard VMD requirements until 40 psi and showed increasing trend while the conventional nozzles matched the standard VMD requirements. The VT black and clear cap nozzles showed better coverage at higher pressures when compared to conventional nozzles. CV values for VT black and clear capped nozzles were less than 10% which indicates capability of good uniform distribution. Spray angle of 110 degrees for VT black and clear capped nozzles was consistent over a range of pressures. &#xd;
&#xd;
Field studies were also conducted to compare the Varitarget to conventional nozzles.  In the varying speed study, droplet size varied from 498 to 621 microns with a SD of 47.50 for VT black nozzle and 465 to 599 microns with a SD of 54.08 for VT clear cap nozzle as the speed varied from 4 to 12 mph. In the varying application rate study, The droplet size varied from 432 to 510 microns with a SD of 27.84 for VT black nozzle and 355 to 452 microns with a SD of 39.80 as the application rate varied from 4 to 12 GPA. In both studies, the observed pressure range required for spraying was minimum and varied slightly.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Growth in the percentage of students of color and English Language Learners in the nation's public schools has significant implications for teacher preparation institutions and professional development programs. Teachers and students alike gain immeasurable benefits from the process that requires them to get in touch with their own cultural, racial, and ethnic heritage.  However, little is known about the racial identity of student teachers and the relationship of their dispositions to meet the needs of diverse learners.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This study examines that issue at a large Midwestern University in a survey of 128 elementary and secondary student teachers. They completed "A Survey of Racial Identity and Dispositions of Student Teachers." The survey had three sections: "Demographics," "Racial Identity Status Self Assessment (RISSA)," and "Dispositions" self-rate their racial identity and dispositions regarding educational practices for diverse learners. Descriptive statistics were organized and reported for all data sets. T-test, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis, and correlations were conducted.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results indicate that the student teachers had low levels of racial identity and that they are unaware of themselves as racial beings. Moreover, students reporting a low racial identity status tend to lack the knowledge of meeting the needs of diverse learners. As student teachers continued to increase in the number of multicultural college credit hours, their racial identity status increased. Thus, the number of enrolled multicultural hours uniquely predicted racial identity status level of the student teachers. &#xd;
&#xd;
Some other main findings included a higher rating by females than males on the RISSA and on meeting the needs of diverse learners. Non-Whites scored higher than Whites on the RISSA, and elementary student teachers tended to score higher than secondary on the RISSA. Recommendations for practice include assessing student teachers racial identity before entering the teacher preparation program, requiring more multicultural college credit hours, and utilizing simulations during preservice preparation. Recommendations for further study include duplicating the study at a historical Black university, replicating the study nationwide, and adding qualitative components to add depth to the data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Unintentional injuries represent the leading cause of death among Americans aged 1-44 years. While there have been many life-saving advances in engineering, attempts to save lives by changing people's behavior have been less successful. For instance, safety and health communications have sometimes led to increased knowledge and self-reported intentions to comply with recommendations, but traditional efforts to demonstrate changes in actual target behaviors have often failed. &#xd;
Research in many settings has shown that narrative communications have exceptional power to persuade and affect peoples' decisions. This suggests that safety and health messages might be more effective if they include narratives, such as brief stories about people who have been injured. The purpose of this dissertation is to determine if safety communications that include stories about injuries result in superior behavioral compliance when compared with traditional abstract safety messages. &#xd;
Teams of two participants assembled a swing set, using written instructions that contained relevant safety messages. Fifty-four teams were randomly assigned to three conditions: story-based safety messages, concrete nonstory safety messages, and traditional abstract safety messages. Compliance with safety messages was defined as the number of compliant components in the finished swing set. After adjustment for covariates, story-based messages resulted in a 20 percent improvement in compliance, compared with concrete nonstory and traditional abstract messages. Covariates included age, gender, (log) childcare experience, equipment assembly experience, presence of observer, and a final covariate related to timing of experimental sessions conducted by different experimenters.&#xd;
A positive relationship was noted between behavioral compliance and immediate (but not delayed) recall of message content. Narrative transportation was also positively related to compliance, but only within the story-based condition.  Behavioral compliance was not related to remindings or judgments about the likelihood of injuries.&#xd;
The research is important because of its potential for improving safety communications and saving lives. Stories about injuries improved safety behavior even though the stories were brief and not designed to be entertaining or transporting. In contrast, the lack of correspondence between observed behavior and many surrogate measures suggests caution is in order when evaluating interventions using self-report measures, delayed memory, and other common dependent variables.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Theoretical and empirical ecological research has emphasized the need for understanding&#xd;
how animals perceive and respond to landscape structure and the importance of integrating both&#xd;
behavioral and landscape approaches when studying movement behavior. Knowledge of insect&#xd;
movement behavior is essential for understanding and modeling dispersal and population&#xd;
structure and developing biologically-based integrated pest management programs. My&#xd;
dissertation research addresses questions concerning how insects respond to landscape structure&#xd;
by examining movement behavior of an important stored-product pest, red flour beetle&#xd;
(Tribolium castaneum), in experimental landscapes.&#xd;
Results show that beetles modify movement behavior depending on landscape structure.&#xd;
Edge effects and interpatch distances may influence landscape viscosity, or the degree to which&#xd;
landscape structure facilitates or impedes movement, resulting in significant differences in&#xd;
velocity and tortuosity (amount of turning) of movement pathways, as well as retention time in&#xd;
landscapes with different levels of habitat abundance and aggregation. Perceptual range, or the&#xd;
distance from which habitat is detected, appears to be limited while beetles are moving in a&#xd;
landscape as they did not respond to a flour resource before physical encounter. Beetles showed&#xd;
differential responses to patches with various characteristics, entering covered patches more&#xd;
quickly than uncovered patches with more resource or the same amount of resource.&#xd;
Permeability of patches changed with subsequent encounters suggesting that full evaluation of&#xd;
patch quality may only occur after entering a patch. Beetles responded to landscape structure&#xd;
differently depending on the activity in which they were engaged. Distribution of movement pathways was similar to that of the habitat, but distribution of oviposition sites were significantly&#xd;
more aggregated than pathways and habitat. Oviposition site choice may be influenced by a&#xd;
complex set of factors which include previous visitation, amount of resource, travel costs, and&#xd;
edge effects. Insights were gained concerning how red flour beetle perceives resources, modifies&#xd;
search strategies, responds to boundaries, and chooses reproductive sites in patchy landscapes.&#xd;
This research provides new information regarding how red flour beetle interacts with landscape&#xd;
structure that has implications in the areas of behavioral and landscape ecology and applications&#xd;
in stored-product insect ecology.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Previous studies show that there has been a deceleration in world wheat yield growth, specifically in irrigated areas, which has led some to believe that the potential for genetic gains is slowing. Some reports claim that the Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo (CIMMYT) breeding program "reached a plateau" in the 1980s. Such a breeding plateau would have global ramifications, since it is often poor consumers who benefit the most from yield enhancement of staple crops including wheat. CIMMYT estimates that by 2020, the developing world will need 40% more wheat than it consumes today. Because of the lack of involvement by private breeders in most low-income countries, CIMMYT, whose germplasm is used extensively in the developing world, will need to ensure that modern varieties that they release are increasing in yield to meet the rising wheat demand in the developing world.&#xd;
&#xd;
CIMMYT, a non-profit organization, distributes improved germplasm to national agricultural research systems (NARS) for worldwide utilization. CIMMYT has consistently invested a large amount of public expenditures in wheat breeding research each year for several decades. Estimates of the impact of the wheat breeding program on increasing wheat yields provides information to scientists, administrators, and policy makers regarding the efficacy and return to these investments. Quantitative estimates of yield improvements due to the wheat breeding program provide important information for future funding decisions. &#xd;
Wheat lines released by CIMMYT during 1962-2002 were analyzed to estimate genetic yield increases associated with the CIMMYT breeding program using test plot data from the Yaqui Valley in Mexico from 1990-2002. Using several econometric techniques including a Just-Pope production function to account for multiplicative heteroscedasticity across the different varieties, results indicate that through the release of modern varieties CIMMYT has contributed 53.77 kg/ha to yield annually in Mexico’s Yaqui Valley during 1962-2002. Estimates of the gains attributed to CIMMYT’s breeding program on a global scale equal 481.47 million (2002) USD annually from 1990-2002. CIMMYT’s average total wheat breeding cost in from 1990-2002 was roughly 13.95 million USD making the average cost-benefit ratio approximately 1:34.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a human food-borne pathogen and cattle feces are a major source of contamination. Immunization against E. coli O157 may be a practical pre-harvest intervention strategy. A siderophore receptor/porin proteins (SRP) based vaccine has been developed to decrease the prevalence of E. coli O157 in cattle. Two studies were conducted to determine the efficacy of the SRP vaccine. In the first study, thirty calves were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control or SRP vaccine. Two weeks after the second vaccination, calves were orally inoculated with nalidixic acid-resistant (Nal[superscriptR]) E. coli O157. Fecal samples were collected for five weeks. Calves were necropsied on day 35 to collect gut contents and tissue swabs to determine Nal[superscriptR] E. coli O157:H7. The number of calves that were culture positive for E. coli O157 were lower (P= 0.07) in vaccinated group compared to the control. In the second study, cattle in two feedlots were randomized to SRP vaccine or control. Cattle were vaccinated on days 0 and 21. Rectal fecal samples were collected on day 0, and pen floor samples were collected on days 21, 35, and 70. Rectal fecal samples, RAMS, and hide swab samples were collected on d 85. Cattle were weighed on days 0, 21, and 85. Vaccination significantly reduced (P = 0.04) fecal E. coli O157 prevalence. There was also a decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in E. coli O157 prevalence on hides and in fecal samples on day 85 in vaccinated cattle compared to the control.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Segregation distortion describes the transmission of an allele or alleles of a heterozygous locus at a higher frequency than expected in a Mendelian ratio. From the organism's view, segregation distortion is the preferential retention of chromosomal blocks carrying genes beneficial to its fitness and reproductive viability. In wheat the best studied segregation distortes are those introduced from Aegilops species; these selfish genetic elements are named gametocidal (Gc) genes and the chromosomes carrying them are called Gc chromosomes. This genetic mechanism causes chromosome breakage in gametophytes lacking the Gc carrier chromosome, thus favoring its own retention in the genome. While the mode of action of the Gc genes is not yet known, they have been used extensively in wheat genetics for the development of deletion stocks, a key resource for elucidating the structure of physical regions containing important genes. The objective of this study was to develop the tools necessary to map the Gc2 gene derived from Ae. sharonensis and perform map-based cloning. Extensive physical and genetic mapping located the gametocidal gene on the distal 1% of the 4BL arm present in the T4BS[dot in middle of line]4BL-4S[sh superscript]#1L translocation chromosome. Comparative genomics using rice provided markers distal and proximal to the Gc2 locus; however, synteny broke down at the locus. The characterization of this chromosomal region has provided insight into its recombination frequency, synteny and composition; however, the dynamic architecture of the end of the chromosome has made comparative mapping of this region difficult.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Food recalls and incidence of foodborne disease are on the rise throughout the world.  Food products are recalled in the United States almost daily, and typically a large quantity of food is affected.  Pathogenic microorganisms are readily invading the food supply and traditional methods and use of antimicrobials are not performing as well as in the past.  The microorganisms that prompt the recalls cause symptoms ranging from mild gastroenteritis to death.  All humans eat food, therefore all humans have the potential to be exposed to pathogens in food at some point in their life.  There is a need for new, more effective antimicrobials for use on food products in order to ensure that consumers have access to a safe food supply.  Any new treatments for prevention of pathogenic growth in the food supply should be researched.  Phage preparations used as antimicrobials on food products are a novel idea.  Phages are advantageous over traditional antimicrobials such as antibiotics, pesticides, and sanitizers in numerous ways.  This report presents the history of phage and phage therapy in humans, advantages and disadvantages of phage use over traditional methods, current phage preparations available or under research, and approvals and objections of phage use in the food supply.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The accuracy and applicability of the existing stress-strain models for concrete confined by Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) were analytically and experimentally explored. This investigation includes major parameters affecting the stress-strain response of confined concrete, including the loading pattern and protocol. It has been observed and reported that the experimentally recorded stress-strain relationship of the same specimen will be different if the loading protocol of the test is switched from displacement control to load control. &#xd;
In the experimental phase of this study, four standard 6" by 12" concrete cylinders were constructed using the same concrete batch for consistency. Three two-inch strain gauges were affixed equally spaced at mid-height on the surface of the specimen in the longitudinal direction, and two two-inch strain gauges were applied in the lateral direction at mid-height opposite each other. CFRP was then impregnated with a two-part epoxy and applied externally in two continuous layers, with an overlap. &#xd;
During the first phase of the experimental program, the tests were conducted with a constant load rate or with a constant displacement rate. The data was collected from externally mounted strain gauges and potentiometers positioned on the opposite sides of the cylinder in the longitudinal direction. &#xd;
Since the capacity of the existing actuator in the structural lab was less than the required failure level of the specimens, a nutcracker-like device was constructed to increase the mechanical advantage of the test frame in the second phase of the experimental program. In this phase, all tests were conducted in displacement control.&#xd;
Various models were selected to be studied from a large number of existing models that propose to determine the stress-strain relationship of concrete. Analytical predictions of the models were compared against the experimental data. Results show that some of the models provide a reasonable prediction of the real performance of the specimen. However, in general, predictions are different from the real performance for most models.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Work engagement has received increased attention by both practitioners and academicians. Researchers and practitioners have focused on the antecedents of employee engagement and the positive outcomes of an employee being engaged. This study served to expand the literature on antecedents and outcomes of work engagement to include human resources practices, such as Realistic Job Previews (RJP) and selection tests, as antecedents. A sample of 161 Information Technology help desk support representatives, who were grouped by receiving or not receiving an RJP and a selection test, were assessed on the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma, and Bakker, 2002). Significant differences were found for individuals who recalled receiving an RJP on work engagement. Significant differences were not found for the selection test group on work engagement. Additional analyses were conducted to determine the predictability of engagement on individual (e.g., personal health and job satisfaction) and organizational outcomes (e.g., turnover intentions and performance). Overall, results suggest that human resources practices should be included in the work engagement model. Additional research directions and organizational implications were discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Corn yield potential is limited by water deficit stress and limited soil nitrogen.  Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted near Manhattan, KS in 2005 and 2006.  The field experiment evaluated the influence of nitrogen (N) rate and increasing Palmer amaranth (PA) density grown alone and in competition with corn in two moisture environments.  In 2006 the dryland environment was very drought stressed, while 2005 had more intermediate conditions.  Weed-free corn yields were approximately half in dryland environments compared to the irrigated environment across years.  Increasing PA density increased corn yield loss similarly in both 2005 environments and in 2006 dryland environment across all N rates.  In the 2006 irrigated environment corn yield loss was increased by decreasing N rate and increasing PA density.  Maximum predicted yield loss at high PA densities in both 2005 environments was 20-54% while in 2006 dryland environment, maximum yield loss was 95% and in the irrigated environment was 62%.  In general, soil moisture environment was more critical than N rate or PA density when determining potential corn yield.  In the greenhouse study a factorial arrangement of two irrigation methods and five crop-weed combinations (corn, PA, GF, corn/PA, and corn/GF) was established with two replications and three runs conducted.  Two plants were grown in 25.4 cm diameter PVC pipe cut into 91.5 cm lengths.  Irrigation application method included a surface and subsurface application.  Plants were harvested at the V10 corn growth stage.  No differences were detected between irrigation methods with respect to above- or below ground biomass production.  Corn aboveground biomass was decreased by the presence of corn or PA but not GF.  Below ground biomass information was presented as column totals because species could not be separated.  There was no impact on root to shoot ratio, total below ground biomass, rooting depth, or root area across the crop-weed combinations except for the GF monoculture columns which were lower than all other crop-weed combinations.  Future research needs to examine the light interception of corn and PA when grown at different N rates along with examining the influence of surface and subsurface irrigation practices on crop weed interactions and weed seed germination in a field setting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A series of chiral symmetrical and unsymmetrical acid-functionalized Schiff-base ligands were synthesized by condensation reactions between 3-formyl salicylic acid and the two diamines (1R,2R)-cyclohexyldiamine (CHDA) and (R)-[1,1'-binapthalene]-2,2'-diamine (BINAM). The addition of a weak base (TEA) to these Schiff-bases resulted in the formation of a partially deprotonated ligand while the addition of the strong base NaOMe, resulted in fully deprotonated ligands. Complexations were carried out using metal salts of Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Cu(I) and Zn(II).  The partially deprotonated unsymmetrical Schiff-base (CHDA as the backbone), resulted almost exclusively in the formation of double-stranded helices with M helices. The fully deprotonated ligand, on the other hand, formed cubane-type structures with Fe(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) in methanol. Similar cubane-type structures were also obtained after complexation of the symmetrical CHDA-based ligands with Fe(II) and Co(II) using NaOMe in methanol. Reactions involving Cu(II) and Cu(I) salts resulted in either mono-or dinuclear salen complexes, even if the unsymmetrical Schiff-base was used as the starting ligand.  This type of ligand conversion is dependent of the metal salt concentration in the reaction. Unsymmetrical Schiff-base ligands have a higher tendency to undergo conversion to their symmetrical salen analogues if the metal salt is added is much excess.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sixty cows were utilized to investigate the use of zilpaterol, implanting, and concentrate feeding on performance, carcass traits, subprimal yield, steak retail display, and meat palatability of cows fed for 70 d.  The 5 treatments were: 1) grass-fed on pasture (Grass); 2) concentrate-fed (C); 3) concentrate-fed and implanted (CI) with a trenbolone acetate/estradiol implant, DE); 4) concentrate-fed and fed zilpaterol beginning on d 38 of the feeding period (CZ); and 5) concentrate-fed, implanted and fed zilpaterol (CIZ).  Hot carcass weights and dressing percentages were higher (P &lt; 0.05) for all concentrate-fed cows than grass-fed cows.  The CIZ cows had the largest and grass-fed cows the smallest longissimus muscle (LM) areas.  Total subprimal weights were lightest for cuts from the grass-fed cows; and CIZ cows had greater weights than those from C cows.  Sensory panelists found LM steaks from C and grass-fed cows were more tender than steaks from CZ and CIZ cows; and steaks from CI cows were more tender than steaks from CIZ cows.  However, no tenderness differences were observed among treatments for knuckle (KN) steaks.  In another study, carcasses from 31 fed cows and 24 fed steers were used to investigate the effects of aging (7 or 28 d) on LM retail display; aging and enhancement (blade tenderization and enhancement solution injection) on LM tenderness; and aging on enhanced KN, top blade, and top sirloin steaks.  Steaks (LM) aged 7 d had less discoloration and were more color stable than steaks aged for 28 d.  A sensory panel found enhanced-cow LM steaks were more tender than non-enhanced steaks; and aging for 28 d improved tenderness compared to 7 d aging for non-enhanced steaks only.  Aging for 28 d compared to 7 d improved Warner-Bratzler shear (more tender) for enhanced cow top sirloin, steer top sirloin, and steer top blade steaks.  Feeding cull cows a concentrate diet improved lean meat yields.  When feeding a concentrate diet a combination of an implant and feeding zilpaterol can further increase lean meat yields.  Enhancement provides an opportunity to improve tenderness of steaks from fed cows and steers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The correlation between polarity and material quality of un-doped Al[0.81subscript]Ga[0.19subscript]N was&#xd;
studied. The overall material quality is significantly influenced by the growth polarity. The&#xd;
epilayers with aluminum-polarity have a much higher crystalline quality and better surface&#xd;
morphology than those of nitrogen-polarity. Nitrogen-polar growth more readily incorporates&#xd;
unintentional impurities.&#xd;
A-plane AlN epilayers have been grown on r-plane sapphire substrates. The orientation&#xd;
and high crystalline quality were confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) [Theta]-2[Theta] scan exhibiting a&#xd;
reflection peak at 2[Theta] = 59.4[0superscript] and rocking curve of the (110) reflection having a line width of 940&#xd;
arcsec. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy showed that the surface&#xd;
emission intensity of a-plane AlN epilayers is comparable to that of c-plane AlN. PL spectra of&#xd;
Mg-doped a- and c-plane AlN revealed that the Mg level in both a- and c-plane AlN is identical&#xd;
and is about ~ 0.5 eV.&#xd;
Identically designed a-plane and c-plane AlN/A1[0.65subscript]Ga[0.35subscript]N QWs have been grown on a-and&#xd;
c-plane AlN/Al[2subscript]O[3subscript] templates respectively, and their PL emission properties were studied.&#xd;
Low temperature PL characteristics of a-plane QWs are primarily governed by the quantum size&#xd;
effect, whereas those of c-plane QWs are significantly affected by the polarization fields.&#xd;
The growth of AlN epilayers on SiC substrates was investigated. A smooth, crack free&#xd;
AlN epilayer with high optical and crystalline quality was achieved. Because of its high quality,&#xd;
AlN was used as active layer in a hybrid Schottky photodetector.&#xd;
Highly conductive Si-doped Al[subscript0.75]Ga[0.25subscript]N alloys were grown on AlN/SiC templates. The&#xd;
effects of using Indium as a surfactant during the growth of Si-doped Al[0.75subscript]Ga[0.25subscript]N epilayers at&#xd;
relatively high temperature 1050 [degrees]C were studied. Indium significantly increases the doping&#xd;
efficiency as shown by RT Hall measurements. RT PL measurements show a clear correlation&#xd;
between emission intensity of the defect related transition and indium flow rate.&#xd;
P-type conductivity has been obtained in beryllium doped GaN by MOCVD. The&#xd;
activation energy of the beryllium acceptor was estimated to be 118 [plus or minus] 4 meV, which is about 40&#xd;
meV less than the activation energy of the Mg acceptor in GaN.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Though many studies do show that emotional abuse exists within a pattern of other physical violence, few researchers have adopted nonphysical abuse as the crux of their research.  The goal of this study is to contribute to the intimate partner violence literature by examining other forms of abuse such as controlling and emotional abuse that are largely neglected in social science research.  More specifically, I examine the connection between women’s employment (status compatibility) and their risk of intimate partner abuse.  Examining the role of male power and control in intimate relationship increases our understanding of the causes and consequences of male-to-female violence.  Data are from the survey of Violence and Threats of Violence Against Women and Men in the United States, 1994-1996.  This survey involved telephone interviews with a national probability sample of approximately 8,000 English-speaking women and 8,000 men ages 18 and older residing in households throughout the United States.  Only women are analyzed in this study.  Respondents were asked about their general fear of violence and ways in which they managed those fears, emotional abuse on the part of their partners, and incidents of actual or threatened violence experienced by all types of offenders.  Taping into status compatibility by measuring women's contribution to relationship economic well-being through employment and education, hypotheses are derived from feminist theory suggesting that women in relationships that benefit men's marital power will experience more emotional abuse than women whose status are compatible with their partners.  Consistent with prior research, controlling and emotional abuse is associated with low education attainment and poverty.  Results reveal that control and emotional abuse is not greatest in relationships in which a male is employed and their female partner is not or in relationships in which a woman is employed and their male partner is not.  Contrary to prior research, relationships in which unemployed men are married to women who work were not found to have experienced more emotional abuse than couples in which both partners are employed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Corporations spend tens of millions of dollars each year to conduct organizational&#xd;
surveys and report the results. It is imperative that survey results provide clear, actionable results&#xd;
to organizational leaders for an employee survey program to be effective. To the extent that&#xd;
survey results are impacted by response style biases, organizations cannot be certain their actions&#xd;
address real issues. The following research examines the impact of managers' national culture on&#xd;
the response styles of their employees. Power distance is a construct that reflects how different&#xd;
cultures address inequality. In this study, power distance scores for managers are hypothesized to&#xd;
be predictive of employee response style behavior such that power distance is positively&#xd;
associated with greater extreme responding and lower acquiescence. Additionally,&#xd;
individualism/collectivism scores for managers are hypothesized to be predictive of employee&#xd;
response style behavior such that individualism is positively associated with greater extreme&#xd;
responding and negatively associated with acquiescence.&#xd;
Overall, results did not support the key hypotheses of the study. While employees from&#xd;
high power distance countries did display higher levels of extreme responding than employees&#xd;
from low power distance countries (Hypothesis 1), none of the other three hypotheses were&#xd;
supported. Despite this lack of significant results, this single result supports Johnson, et al.'s&#xd;
(2005) results from a sample of over eighteen-thousand employees in nineteen countries&#xd;
suggesting it is a consistent, real difference between high and low power distance countries.&#xd;
There were several limitations to be considered in evaluating this research. First, the study was&#xd;
based on archival data limiting the flexibility of the design and analysis. Another key limitation&#xd;
that should be addressed in future research is the use of abstracted cultural trait scores. Despite&#xd;
the lack of significant results and the limitations of this study, the fact remains that differences in&#xd;
response behaviors do exist across different cultures and geographic locations. Further research&#xd;
is needed to more clearly understand the influence that geographic culture, organizational culture&#xd;
and individual level demographics may have on employee response styles to help facilitate how&#xd;
organizations understand survey results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Today the geographic distance between workers is increasing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distributed work environment by specifically focusing on leader behavior and its impact on subordinate outcomes. This study asked if the traditional core set of leadership behaviors is effective in distributed work environments, and how those behaviors impact employee outcomes such as commitment and satisfaction with supervision. Several fundamental and explored questions included: Do essential management behaviors such as consideration and initiating structure materialize differently in face-to-face versus remote situations, what type of leadership will have the most positive impact on employee's perceptions of satisfaction with supervision and organizational commitment, and does this differ according to the amount of face time between the manager and employee? &#xd;
Correlational data results did not support the hypotheses that face to face interaction scores were positively correlated with affective commitment, or satisfaction with supervision. Face to face interaction was not negatively correlated with continuance commitment. Non-remote employees reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction with supervision than remote employees. There was a significant difference between remote and non remote employees with non remote employees reporting higher levels of career advancement than remote employees. There was a stronger relationship between initiating structure and satisfaction with supervision when spatial distance was high. It appears that spatial distance acted as an enhancer. Two scales, company support for remote management and remote management specific behaviors, were analyzed to obtain preliminary data for future research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Vanadium phosphorous oxide (VPO) is traditionally manufactured from solid vanadium oxides by synthesizing VOHPO[4subscript][dot in middle of line]0.5H[2subscript]O (the precursor) followed by in-situ activation to produce (VO)[2subscript]P[2subscript]O[subscript]7 (the active phase). These catalysts considerably improve their performance when prepared as nanostructured materials and this study discusses an alternative synthesis method based on sol-gel techniques capable of producing nanostructured VPO. Vanadium(V) triisopropoxide oxide was reacted with ortho-phosphoric acid in tetrahydrofuran (THF). This procedure yielded a gel of VOPO[4subscript] with interlayer entrapped molecules. The gels were dried at high pressure in an autoclave with controlled excess and composition of THF-2-propanol mixtures. The surface area of the obtained materials was between 50 and 120 m[2superscript]/g. Alcohol produced by the alkoxide hydrolysis and incorporated along with the excess solvent reduced the vanadium during the drying step. Therefore, after the autoclave drying, the solid VOPO[4subscript] was converted to the precursor; and, non-agglomerated platelets were observed. Use of additional 2-propanol increased the amount of precursor in the powder but reduced its surface area and increased its crystallite size. In general, sol-gel prepared catalysts were significantly more selective than the traditionally prepared materials, and it is suggested that the small crystallite size obtained in the precursor influenced the crystallite size of the active phase increasing their selectivity towards maleic anhydride. The evaluation of these materials as catalysts for the partial oxidation of n-butane at 673 K under mixtures of 1.5% n-butane in air yielded selectivity of 40% at 50% conversion compared to 25% selectivity at similar level of conversion produced by the traditionally prepared catalysts. Variations in the catalytic performance are attributed to observed polymorphism in the activated materials, which is evidenced by remarkable differences in the intrinsic activity. All precursors and catalysts were characterized by IR, XRD, SEM and BET, and the products of the catalytic tests were analyzed by GC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Antimicrobials are included in finishing cattle diets for growth promotion, feed&#xd;
efficiency, and protection against liver abscesses. The inclusion of in-feed antimicrobials at or&#xd;
below therapeutic concentrations may provide a selective pressure for antimicrobial resistant&#xd;
microorganisms. Additionally, heavy metals such as copper and zinc may be included in cattle&#xd;
diets because of growth-promoting effects. Heavy metal resistance genes are on transferable&#xd;
plasmids that also contain antimicrobial resistance genes. The objectives of this research were to&#xd;
1) determine the prevalence of food-borne pathogens, Salmonella and E. coli O157, in cattle fed&#xd;
diets with or without monensin and tylosin and 0 or 25% wet corn distiller's grains (WDGS), 2)&#xd;
determine the prevalence of food-borne pathogens in cattle fed elevated concentrations of copper&#xd;
and zinc 3) evaluate the effect of antimicrobials on antimicrobial susceptibility of food-borne&#xd;
pathogens and commensal fecal bacteria, and 4) determine a possible association between in-feed&#xd;
antimicrobials and the concentration of antimicrobial resistance genes in the feces of cattle.&#xd;
Inclusion of 25% WDGS was associated with a higher prevalence of E. coli O157 on one of two&#xd;
sample collection days; however, there was no association between the use of monensin and&#xd;
tylosin, or copper and zinc on the prevalence of food-borne pathogens. Including monensin and&#xd;
tylosin in cattle diets was associated with an increased resistance of enterococci to macrolides,&#xd;
but was not related to concentration of the common macrolide resistance gene, ermB. In cattle&#xd;
fed diets with copper and/or zinc, no differences were observed in antimicrobial susceptibility or&#xd;
the concentration of antimicrobial resistance genes. In conclusion, results indicate that including&#xd;
growth-promoting antimicrobials in cattle diets at below therapeutic concentrations only&#xd;
limitedly impacted antimicrobial susceptibility and concentration of fecal antimicrobial&#xd;
resistance genes; however, this research encompassed only a select number of microorganisms.&#xd;
The positive association between WDGS and E. coli O157 prevalence in cattle has important&#xd;
implications for food safety, and warrants further investigation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study is a follow-up to Al-Fadda's (2004) investigation of middle school teacher's perceptions of the importance of reading methods. The primary research question to be addressed in this study was: What are ELL and LD teachers' perceptions of the importance of specific reading strategies for their respective types of students? To address this question the researcher developed a survey with five demographic questions and 44 reading methods based on the framework of the COBRA model developed by Heerman (2002). The researcher administered the survey to public middle and junior high school ELL and LD teachers from Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas and compared the two groups' perceptions of the importance of several reading strategies. Analysis of the results showed that there was a 60% agreement rate between the two teacher groups (no significant differences) for three of the COBRA goals (background knowledge, comprehension, and study and application) and a 40% difference rate between the two teacher groups (significant differences) for two of the COBRA goals (experiential learning and vocabulary). For the 44 survey items, there was an agreement rate of 82.82%, and a difference rate of 17.18%. The researcher concludes that there were more similarities than differences between ELL teachers' and LD teachers' perceptions of the importance of the surveyed reading methods, however, there were also real differences. The researcher found justification for the belief that ELL and LD teachers should be considered specialist teachers when it comes to rating the relative importance of reading methods. ELL teachers appear to be inclined to use reading methods related to language, experience, and vocabulary methods. The results also reveal that LD teachers appear to be inclined to use reading methods related to intervention strategies with conferencing, coaching, compensatory methods, specific skills development and memory processes. In addition, the researcher noted a large number of methods with small mean differences, showing the certain levels of agreement between the two teacher groups. In terms of the five teacher variables, percentage of ELL students, percentage of low-income students and school enrollment proved to be the least active variables but the teacher variables of teachers' education levels and teachers' experience levels were more active.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Purpose: Skipped-generation households are increasing both nationally and in Kansas. This qualitative study explored the nutrition-related practices and attitudes of Kansas older skipped-generation caregivers and the children under their care. Design and Methods: Twenty-three Kansas caregivers representing 19 households were interviewed about a range of topics using a semi-structured approach. Interview transcriptions were content analyzed. Results: Nutrition-related practices and attitudes changed over time. Compared to when they were parenting the first time, skipped-generation caregivers reported that they are more nutrition and food safety conscious and have shifted in their parenting style. Their grandchildren appeared to be adversely affected by an on-the-go lifestyle and the use of more electronics. Caregiver sources of child feeding advice are based mostly on tradition. Caregivers believed that nutrition and safe food handling are important; they held beliefs that nutritious food is expensive; and most did not believe they would use population-specific nutrition education materials. The preferred distribution of nutrition education materials was through grandparent support groups. Implications: Research was exploratory in nature with a limited sample size. This population could benefit from education incorporating topics on infant, child, adolescent, and sports nutrition; healthful recipes and snack ideas; quick and inexpensive healthful meals that are low in fat, sugar, and salt; healthful fast food and packaged food options; the importance of checking the internal temperatures of meat when cooking; ways to feed "picky eaters;" benefits of eating together as a family; tips to limit children's sedentary time; and intergenerational gardening and cooking.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study focused on the professional development experiences of teachers in the Altai Republic, Russian Federation. Russia is a country in flux, transitioning from a totalitarian state into a democracy reflective of its unique ethnic composition, geographic context, and history. The Russian educational system is currently undergoing computerization and teachers are learning to integrate educational technology into classroom practice. In this setting, teachers are beginning to learn how to integrate educational technologies into their classroom practices. This qualitative study explored the potential for transformative learning associated with this type of learning and experience. &#xd;
Transformative learning theory (TLT) was used to explore if and how the world views and perspectives of teachers is changing with respect to their educational philosophies and classroom practice. The study utilized multiple sources of evidence (interviews with program and school administrators, school teachers, observation) and multiple units of analysis (federal/republic levels of training and support, school level training and support, informal experiences, teachers, administrators). &#xd;
Findings indicated that the methods used to train teachers have a high likelihood of being facilitative of transformative learning. It also found that teachers are beginning to think and act in new ways based on their experiences with educational technology. Teachers are also collaborating in this learning process, which provides an important support for continued learning and growth. Findings also indicate that TLT is a useful framework for exploring transformative learning in this setting and helped to uncover the elements of transformative learning which are culturally determined. Further research is needed to further our understanding of how transformation occurs and is experienced in this setting. Collaboration with local experts and researchers is necessary to uncover the cultural differences related to perspective change. &#xd;
Many future pathways are available for continuing to explore transformative learning in this context. They include continued work with teachers, a general exploration of transformative learning, and work with university students.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin A on growth, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of ruminants.  In Experiment 1, 40 crossbred wethers (BW = 28.7 kg) were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments:  backgrounding (BG) and finishing (FN) with no vitamin A (LL); BG with no vitamin A, FN with high vitamin A (6,600 IU[dot in middle of line]kg [superscript-1] diet) (LH); BG with high vitamin A and FN with no vitamin A (HL); and BG and FN with high vitamin A (HH).  During BG (d 1 to 56), intake was restricted to achieve 0.22 kg ADG.  During FN (d 57 to 112), lambs consumed the same diet ad libitum.  Lambs were humanely slaughtered after 112 d.  There were no treatment differences (P > 0.05) in feed intake, ADG, or final BW.  Carcasses from the HH group had higher (P &lt; .05) marbling scores (514 vs. 459), and 25.8 % more extractable intramuscular lipid (IMF) than LL (3.88 vs. 3.08 % for HH and LL, respectively, P &lt; .05); the LH and HL treatments were intermediate.  The was a negative correlation (r = -0.38) between serum fatty acid content and %IMF.   Experiment 1 data suggest that increased marbling may be achieved with high vitamin A for 112 d in lambs.  In Experiment 2, Angus crossbred steers (n = 48), were either early-weaned (EW) at 137[plus or minus]26 d of age or weaned at a traditional age (TW) 199[plus or minus]26 d and allotted to either 42,180 IU vitamin A[dot in middle of line]hd[superscript-1][dot in middle of line]d[superscript-1] (HA) or no vitamin A (NA).  Early- and TW steers consumed treatments for 235[plus or minus]17 and 175[plus or minus]18 d, respectively.  Serum and liver retinol content diverged dramatically (both, P &lt; 0.01) by the end of the experiment and TW steers tended (P > 0.10) to have higher ADG than EW steers (1.31[plus or minus]0.2 and 1.48[plus or minus]0.2 kg[dot in middle of line]hd[superscript-1][dot in middle of line]d[superscript-1], respectively).  Steers were humanely slaughtered at 1.02 cm fat.   Weights tended (P = 0.08) to be heavier and carcasses were fatter (P &lt; 0.05) for HA than NA.  Marbling score and % IMF were higher (P &lt; 0.05) for EW-NA than other treatments.  Percentage of USDA Choice and Prime carcasses doubled (P &lt; 0.05) for NA than HA.  Yield grades increased (P &lt; 0.05) with EW-HA and were similar (P > 0.10) among other treatments.  Feeding NA was effective for increasing marbling without increasing fat; EW enhanced these effects.  Reasons for the contradictory results in these 2 experiments are unclear.  Species differences in the ability to metabolize retinol are implicated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation describes the role of myosin-interacting guanine nucleotide exchange factor (MyoGEF) and centrosome/spindle pole associated protein (CSPP) in mitotic progression and cytokinesis.  We have identified three mouse isoforms of CSPP, all of which interact and colocalize with MyoGEF to the central spindle in anaphase cells. The N-terminus of MyoGEF interacts with myosin whereas the C terminus interacts with the N-terminus of CSPP, forming a complex. The N-terminus of CSPP appears to be important for both localization and interaction with MyoGEF.  CSPP plays a role in mitotic progression since its depletion by RNAi resulted in metaphase arrest.  MyoGEF is required for completion of cytokinesis.  Both MyoGEF and CSPP are phosphorylated by mitotic kinases including Plk1 and Aurora. Importantly, MyoGEF is phosphorylated at Thr-574 in mitosis by Polo-like kinase 1, and this phosphorylation is required for activation of RhoA.  Thr-543 of MyoGEF is required for Plk1 binding in mitosis and phosphorylation of MyoGEF by Cdk1/cyclinB, possibly at Thr-543 may generate a Plk1 docking site, i.e., Cdk1 can phosphorylate MyoGEF at Thr-543, thereby allowing Plk1 to bind and phosphorylate MyoGEF at Thr-574.  Finally, MyoGEF and CSPP are also phosphorylated by Aurora-B kinase in vitro. Taken together, we propose that Aurora-B may phosphorylate and recruit MyoGEF and CSPP to the central spindle, where phosphorylation of MyoGEF at Thr-543 promotes Polo kinase binding and additional phosphorylation of MyoGEF, leading to the activation of RhoA at the cleavage furrow.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explored the relationship between anesthesiology residents' In Training Examination (ITE) percentile ranks and learning styles and domains with the variables of gender, ethnicity, and postgraduate year (PGY). The ITE is a national examination given annually as a measure of cognitive achievement. The learning style instrument was the adapted Vermunt Inventory of Learning Styles (ILS), a diagnostic learning style instrument designed for use with university-level students. The study included 112 anesthesiology residents in anesthesiology graduate medical education (GME) at four universities (five sites) during the 2006-2007 PGY. Responses to the surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the Pearson product-moment correlations, and stepwise and backward elimination regression analysis.&#xd;
The results indicated that the residents' ITE percentile ranks had a bimodal curve. The ILS has 20 scales representing four learning domains factored into four learning styles. The relationships of the learning styles with the ITE percentile ranks were significant for two learning styles: positive for the meaning directed learning style (MDLS) and negative for the undirected learning style (UDLS). Analysis of the scales comprising the MDLS (seven) and UDLS (five) revealed significant relationships for 6 of the 12 scales for the anesthesiology residents (five positive, one negative).&#xd;
An analysis of the domain scale relationships for the other eight scales identified an additional two scales positively related to ITE percentile ranks: vocation oriented and analyzing. The significant scales positively identified with ITE percentile ranks included relating and structuring, concrete processing, two self-regulation scales, construction of knowledge, analyzing and vocation oriented. The only scale significant with ITE percentile ranks was ambivalent, which was negative. The potential exists that the UDLS can identify, in part, residents at risk academically. The positive relationship of the meaning directed learning style and the two significant, positive scales (analyzing and vocation oriented) with ITE percentile ranks offered an indication of learning styles and strategies of residents with higher cognitive achievement outcomes. These learning strategies have the potential to help residents learn how to learn more effectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In present competitive market, there is growing concern for ascertaining and fulfilling the individual customer’s wants and needs. Therefore, the focus of manufacturing has been shifting from mass production to mass customization, which requires the manufacturers to introduce an increasing number of products with shorter life span and at a lower cost. Also, another challenge is to manage the variety of products in an environment where demands are stochastic and the lead times to fulfill those demands are short. &#xd;
The focus of this thesis is to develop and investigate platform based production strategies, as opposed to producing each product independently, which would ensure the economic production of the broader specialized products with small final assembly time and under demand uncertainty.  &#xd;
The thesis proposes three different platform based production models. The first model considers the economic production of products based on a single platform and with forecasted demands of the products.  The model is formulated as a general optimization problem that considers the minimization of total production costs.&#xd;
The second model is the extension of the first model and considers the production of products based on multiple platforms and considers the minimization of total production costs and the setup costs of having multiple platforms.&#xd;
The third model is also an extension of the first model and considers the demands of the products to be stochastic in nature. The model considers the minimization of total production costs and shortage costs of lost demands and holding cost of surplus platforms under demand uncertainties. The problem is modeled as a two stage stochastic programming with recourse.&#xd;
As only the small instances of the models could be solved exactly in a reasonable time, various heuristics are developed by combining the genetic evolutionary search approaches and some operations research techniques to solve the realistic size problems. The various production models are validated and the performances of the various heuristics tailored for the applications are investigated by applying these solution approaches on a case of cordless drills.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The overall aims of this dissertation are to determine the incidence and magnitude of insulin resistance (IR) in a cohort of normoglycemic college-age subjects with a family history of type 2 diabetes, and to ascertain if there is early macro- and microvascular dysfunction relative to IR.  Study 1 (Chapter 2) revealed a 7-fold range in IR in healthy college subjects concomitant with measures of insulin, both fasted and during an oral glucose tolerance test, but not related with any measure of plasma glucose.  These results emphasize that early in the etiology of carbohydrate dysregulation, abnormalities first occur with regard to insulin sensitivity.  Using brachial artery blood flow (BABF, Doppler fluxometry) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Chapter 3) we extended the understanding of the use of these non-invasive tools to assess forearm resting metabolic rate and to compare the parameters of both the NIRS oxy-hemoglobin signal, as a index of perfusion in the microcirculation, and BABF, as an independent measure of microvascular reactivity during post occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH).  Resting metabolic rate ranged ~ 2 fold (2.83-5.15 [Mu]MO[subscript2]/min/100g) similar to direct measures.  Amplitude, but not kinetic parameters for NIRS variables correlated with comparable parameters for BABF, providing evidence for the possible utility of NIRS in examining microvascular reactivity.  In study 3 (Chapter 4), utilizing our extended understanding of hemodynamics garnered from the results of study 2, we assessed the influence of IR on macro- and microvascular reactivity.  We observed that i) the magnitude of IR was significantly correlated with attenuation of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the brachial artery (P&lt; .01) indicating the possibility of a reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and an enhanced atherogenic milieu.  Additionally we found ii) BABF at rest and during reactive hyperemia to be strongly correlated with conductance (reduced downstream resistance—an indicator of microvascular control abnormalities) independent of forearm metabolic rate, and   iii) parameters of BABF (microvascular response) were also strongly correlated with brachial artery vasoreactivity (macrovascular response).  In conclusion, this body of work furthers our insight into the need for earlier identification of "disease" earlier in the progression to type 2 diabetes, and provides direction for future investigations into prevention / intervention to improve microvessel functionality and to slow the atherosclerotic process in larger vessels.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explored how people perceive and receive social support, react to stress, and value different communication skills across cultures.  Three hundred and four American students and 134 Taiwanese students participated.  It was predicted that Taiwanese students would utilize social support less and rely on internally targeted control strategies more than would American students.  Conversely, it was predicted that both groups would equally favor comforting and ego support from friendship.  The results, however, indicated that the groups did not differ on utilizing social support, and Americans favored ego support more than did Taiwanese.  Since cross-cultural contacts are encouraged in many fields such as business and academia, the results have pragmatic implications for cross-cultural mutual understanding, international trading, and sojourners' adjustment training.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the last few decades, franchising has become a part of everyday life in the United States. Many firms in a variety of industries have adopted franchising as a method of doing business. Despite the importance of franchising, the literature on why firms initially choose to franchise and how franchising affects financial performance has been scant (Combs et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2005). The purposes of this study were 1) to examine how well agency theory, resource scarcity theory, risk-sharing theory, and specific knowledge theory justify the franchising decision, 2) to investigate whether franchising affects restaurant firms' market value and profitability, and 3) to investigate the relationship between the ownership mix, combination of franchised and company-owned outlets, and financial performance.  &#xd;
For the statistical analysis, the data were collected from the Standard and Poor's COMPUSTAT database, Bond's Franchise Guide and 10 K reports. A logistic regression model was developed to identify a set of variables that best differentiated firms engaged in franchise contracts from those that were not. The statistical results indicated that: 1) Young and growing firms used franchise more to increase the flow of resources. This result supported resource scarcity theory.  2) The degree of geographic dispersion and involvement in foreign countries increased the probability of a firm's decision to franchise. These results supported agency theory. 3) The decrease of specific knowledge requirements increased the franchising probability. This result supported specific knowledge theory.&#xd;
T-tests and multivariate regression models were used to test how franchising affects firms' financial performance. The findings indicated that 1) franchised firms had better financial performance than non-franchised firms, 2) the relationship between ownership mix and financial performance was curvilinear and the inverted U-shaped relationship suggested the existence of optimal ownership mix that can maximize a firm's financial performance, and 3) ownership mix not only directly affected a firm's intangible assets, but also indirectly affected a firm's intangible assets through advertising. This study found that a purely company owned or a purely franchised chain did not produce the best financial performance. Restaurant companies could use both company-owned and franchised units to leverage the strengths of one another, which will yield a better overall financial performance than if either structure was to operate alone.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study attempted to develop a multi-item scale that measures restaurant customers' emotional experiences and has desirable reliability and validity, and to examine the relationships among consumption emotions, customer satisfaction, switching barriers, and revisit intention in the full-service restaurant industry.  &#xd;
In the process of developing a consumption emotion measurement scale, this study followed Churchill's (1979) paradigm during the early stage and confirmatory factor analytic approach suggested by Gerbing and Anderson (1988) and Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) in the later stage.  The scale development process began with a specification of domain of construct, generation of 40 items, and data collection.  The collected data were subjected to item refinement (i.e., outlier detection, descriptive and reliability analysis, and exploratory factor analysis).  Four underlying dimensions of consumption emotions with 32 refined items were identified from the data.  A new sample of data was collected for additional testing (i.e., reliability and validity).  A confirmatory factor analysis using the new data indicated that the finalized measure using categorical dimension approach was unidimensional, reliable, and valid.  The results of structural equation modeling supported the criterion validity indicating that the finalized measure behaves as expected in relation to additional construct.   &#xd;
In study two, a theoretical framework for understanding the relationships among consumption emotions, customer satisfaction, switching barriers, and revisit intention was proposed and tested.  A series of modeling comparisons provided a best fit model.  A measurement model estimated on the basis of Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) approach tested validity of measures.  The results of structural equation modeling using the data from a web-based survey addressed the effect of consumption emotions on satisfaction and revisit intention.  The partial/full mediating impact of satisfaction was verified following Baron and Kenny’s (1986) suggested process.  The switching barriers, two positive (i.e., preference and relational investment) and two negative (i.e., switching costs and lack of alternatives), that restaurant customers are likely to perceive were identified through the qualitative approach, using the guidelines suggested by Maxwell (2005).  The quantitative approach validated the scale applicability.  The moderating role of switching barriers in forming revisit intention was verified by testing for metric invariances.  Grouping was done by using K-means cluster analysis.  Measurement invariance tests supported full metric/partial metric invariances.  Structural invariance tests and invariance tests for a hypothesized path provided the evidence of moderating effect of switching barriers.  Finally, theoretical and managerial implications of the findings were discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Protection motivation theory (PMT) was used in this study to investigate food service directors' food bioterrorism risk perception and their intentions to implement a food defense management plan in their operations.  A cross sectional study using the self administered survey was conducted to test hypotheses. All measurement items for the construct of interests were assessed using a 7-point Likert type scales. Questionnaires were mailed in March 2007 to a national sample of 2,200 randomly selected on-site food service directors employed in school districts and healthcare operations. A total 449 usable completed questionnaires were received. Descriptive statistics were performed to investigate directors' perceptions, motivations and intentions independently. Before testing the actual hypotheses, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess reliability and construct validity of the measurement model.&#xd;
Food service directors perceived that the result of a food terrorist attack would be severe but the chances it would occur in their operations is limited.  They agreed that implementation of a food defense management plan would be effective to address food terrorism issue in their operations. They were highly motivated to protect the operation from an attack and to avoid the risk of terrorism and intended to implement a food defense plan in their operation.  &#xd;
Based on the hypotheses testing, results revealed that motivation to protect the operation against food bioterrorism is higher when directors perceived a higher level of risk (severity and vulnerability), rated the effectiveness of a food defense management plan in protecting the operation high, and perceived that their operations were able to implement it.  In turn, high level of motivation to protect the operation led to higher level of implementation intention. &#xd;
Results of the study can be used to design communication resources developed to enhance food service directors' intention to implement a food defense management plan. Educational and informational resources related to intentional food contamination and its defense should emphasize response efficacy and possibility perception.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Characterized by variable impedances, DC power sources normal operation, reliability, and life-time is negatively affected by the sequential switching within any DC power system. The impedances of Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) storage batteries and Direct Ethanol Fuel Cells (DEFC) vary nonlinearly; therefore, existing DC power system models, that employ averaging of the sequential switching process, are inaccurate in describing the system output voltage. &#xd;
In this research, Fourier-series models of DC–DC converters are developed and evaluated, through numerical computations and computer simulations. Both NiCd-DC converter and DEFC-DC converter power systems are experimentally evaluated over a selected switching frequency range. Input voltage and output voltage characteristics of two types of DEFC-DC converter systems (Nickel-mesh and Nickel-foam electrode assembly) are determined. Experimental results are compared to computer simulations, thus validating the Fourier-series models.  &#xd;
Experimental results show a correlation between the DC converter switching frequency and the output of the DC power system. Sequential switching operation, along with the type of DC converter employed, are factors determining the maximum power transfer of the system. The models developed in this work are flexible over a large switching frequency range, and for any desired duty cycle. Correction factors, accounting for the source-converter impedance matching, are easily implemented in Fourier-series models. The research demonstrates the advantages of Fourier-series models, as compared to both large-signal and small-signal models, with regard to accuracy and ease of implementation to any DC–DC converter-driven power system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rice blast is a major fungal disease on rice, caused by the hemibiotrophic filamentous ascomycete fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. This disease accounts for 157 million tons of grain loss annually. The fungus produces a specialized cell called appressorium to penetrate the host surface barrier and enter inside. It produces intracellular Invasive Hyphae (IH) that grow form cell to cell to colonize the host. The mechanisms of appressorium formation and host penetration have been studied in detail but the host colonization strategies remain largely unknown. We applied live-cell imaging to characterize spatial and temporal development of IH and plant responses inside successively-invaded rice cells.  Early loading experiments with the endocytotic tracker, FM4-64, showed dynamic plant membranes around IH. These hyphae showed remarkable plasticity and recruited plant cell components. IH exhibited pseudohyphal growth and were sealed in plant membrane, termed the Extra-Invasive Hyphal Membrane (EIHM). The fungus spent up to 12 hours in the first cell, often tightly packing it with IH.  IH that moved into neighboring cells were biotrophic, although they were initially thinner and grew more rapidly.  IH in neighboring cells were wrapped in EIHM with distinct membrane caps at the hyphal tips.  Time-lapse imaging showed IH scanning plant cell walls before crossing them, and transmission electron microscopy showed crossing occurring at pit fields.  This and additional evidence strongly suggest that IH co-opt plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell movement. Our studies have revealed insights into a novel hemibiotrophic strategy employed by the blast fungus. Few genes have been previously characterized that impact the biotrophic IH. To understand the molecular basis of the biotrophic infection strategy we employed Laser Microdissection (LM) technology to isolate and purify the IH at this early growth stage. We compared the gene expression of these samples with axenically-grown mycelium using M. oryzae whole genome microarrays. We identified several hundreds of infection specific genes. We have shown that LM technology can be used to isolate homogenous cells from the infected rice tissues to study the underlying molecular mechanisms of signaling during disease formation.

<dc:description>Professional development of in-service teachers continues to increase, but not all&#xd;
programs are successful in promoting teacher learning and student improvement. This qualitative&#xd;
study offers an examination of how one professional development program, The National&#xd;
Writing Project, with its teachers-teaching-teachers model is making a difference. The National&#xd;
Writing Project is one of the longest running, most cost-efficient, and most successful&#xd;
professional development programs in education. The purpose of this study was to identify&#xd;
factors influencing teacher transformation. Five areas were addressed: (1) the identification of&#xd;
transformation factors; (2) the relationship of personal literacy as it affects professional change;&#xd;
(3) being a member of a learning community and how it affects personal learning; (4) being a&#xd;
member of a learning community and how it affects professional learning; and (5) the role of&#xd;
spirituality in transformation. The setting was the National Writing Project's Invitational&#xd;
Summer Institute as it examined how fellows, first time participants, perceived their learning.&#xd;
Participants were from 17 different writing project sites across the United States. Data collection&#xd;
involved three distinct sources: (1) selection of participant and rationale provided by site&#xd;
directors of writing project sites; (2) audio-taped long interviews of each participant; and, (3) a&#xd;
follow-up focus group conducted in an electronic discussion board. The findings highlighted an&#xd;
interweaving of five factors influencing teacher transformation: (1) identification and application&#xd;
of knowledge for self and students; (2) reflection of learning and practice; (3) collaboration; (4)&#xd;
active and on-going involvement; and, (5) supportive and safe environment. When these five&#xd;
transformative factors are designed and implemented in the professional development of teacher&#xd;
in-service, teachers are provided an opportunity to personally learn which leads to professional&#xd;
learning and improved instruction for student learning. Excerpts from each data collection,&#xd;
recommendations for future research, and appendices to replicate the study are provided.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A commonly accepted practice in employment selection is to collect biographical information in the form of resumes.  Surprisingly, little research is conducted in this area to learn how reviewers evaluate relevant biographical information and considerable less research is devoted to exploring possible methods on how to improve this evaluation process.  Current research explored one possible training method that may later show great utility in improving accuracy and consistency in ratings for a number of work-related constructs.  Frame-of-reference training, which is primarily utilized in the field of performance appraisal, was hypothesized to be a beneficial training technique in an effort to improve accuracy.  Frame-of-reference (FOR) training attempts to create a common frame of reference among raters when assessing rates' behaviors.  Through a process of practice and feedback, FOR training tunes raters to common notions of what good or poor would be on a particular dimension.  The result is often more accurate ratings with less variation between raters.  Personality (conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness only), general cognitive ability, and organizational citizenship behaviors were the constructs of interest.  The analysis provided initial support for most of the hypotheses which suggested that frame-of-reference training would create more accurate and reliable estimates of applicant's personality, cognitive ability, and even organizational citizenship behaviors.  In addition to influencing participants' estimates of applicant's scores on a number of workplace constructs, it was also found that participants were influenced as a function of type of training on their willingness to interview and overall impressions of the applicants.  Limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rice (Oryza sativa L.) production worldwide is constrained by rice blast disease caused&#xd;
by the ascomycetous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Rice blast has become a model system for the&#xd;
study of fungal plant diseases based on its global relevance to agriculture and on our ability to&#xd;
apply molecular genetic and genomic analyses to both the pathogen and the plant. We have&#xd;
applied molecular and cellular analyses to understand critical processes in the M. oryzae disease&#xd;
cycle. The dark melanin pigment produced by the fungus is critical for the function of its&#xd;
specialized appressorial cell, which punches the leaf surface by generating the highest pressure&#xd;
known in any biological system, estimated at 80 times the atmospheric pressure. Without&#xd;
melanin, the fungus can neither generate this pressure nor puncture the plant surface and disease&#xd;
does not occur. M. oryzae genome sequencing identified a cluster of melanin biosynthesis genes&#xd;
that included an attractive candidate for the transcription factor that regulates melanin&#xd;
biosynthesis in appressoria. We report the structural and functional characterization of this&#xd;
putative transcription factor, although its role remains elusive. Host cellular responses after&#xd;
appressorial penetration are equally important in determining if disease will occur. We have&#xd;
characterized the cellular response of one rice variety to a compatible fungal strain (causes&#xd;
disease), an incompatible strain (fails to cause disease due to specific triggering of rice defenses)&#xd;
and a non-host strain (causes disease in barley but not in rice). Distinctive fungal and rice&#xd;
cellular responses correlated with the outcome of each particular pathogen-strain rice interaction.&#xd;
We report contrasting responses in two rice leaf sheath assays that are amenable to live cell&#xd;
microscopy, as well as a novel cellular response of crystalline aggregations deposited inside the&#xd;
host cell under appressoria on the leaf surface. Our studies have important implications for future&#xd;
analyses of pathogenicity and host specificity in rice blast disease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The study found, based on a focus group with professionals and secondary research conducted in 2007, that public relations (PR) graduates are not prepared for the job market and that nothing has changed in 15 years to improve this situation.&#xd;
Why? Because there has been no feedback from the professionals, PR students who are hired in PR positions, and PR Students who are not hired in PR positions, to the educators and universities on what is working and what is not working for PR graduates to obtain a position in the PR field. Basically, there is no follow-up after students graduate. &#xd;
This study did preliminary research and developed a survey of PR professionals, PR students and educators so that they can provide feedback. This study made recommendations based on the main points from the focus group, which centered on educational programs, PR students' curriculum, the importance of developing good writing skills, taking business courses, taking several PR internships, being involved in extracurricular activities, and the importance of learning how to prepare a resume.&#xd;
In turn, the follow up survey should help provide security for the PR industry to keep PR alive, by increasing the number of graduates due to their success as a PR professional based on their education.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The hemibiotrophic rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae undergoes complex morphological development throughout its infection cycle. From 8-20 hours after a fungal spore lands on a leaf surface, the fungus differentiates a complex appressorium that punctures the host cuticle. By ~24 hours post inoculation (hpi), the fungus grows inside an epidermal cell as a primary hypha, and by 36 hpi the fungus has differentiated specialized biotrophic invasive hyphae (IH) that are filling the first-invaded cell and moving into neighbor cells. Throughout its life cycle, IH invade living rice cells although invaded cells appear dead when the fungus moves into the next cell. Biotrophic invasion must be mediated by fungal effectors, proteins that pathogens secrete inside live host cells to control them. However, little is known about blast effectors, and the low fungal biomass in early infection stages complicates identification of effector genes, as well as identification of rice genes controlled by effectors. The characterized AVR-Pita effector gene is specifically expressed in planta, but it was not clear how its gene expression pattern changed in different infection stages. We found that AVR-Pita is first expressed around the time of penetration. AVR-Pita is highly expressed in IH developing in asymptomatic tissue from 36 hpi to as late as 7 days post inoculation when lesions are maturing. Using inoculated rice sheaths, we successfully enriched for infected tissue RNA that contained ~20% IH RNA at 36 hpi. We compared IH gene expression to expression in mycelium from pure culture using a whole-genome M. oryzae oligoarray, and we compared infected rice gene expression to expression in mock-inoculated tissue using a rice oligoarray. Rice genes that were induced >50-fold during infection were enriched for genes involved in transferring information from sensors to cellular responses. Fungal genes that were induced >50-fold in IH included known effectors and many IH-specific genes encoding hypothetical secreted proteins that are candidate effectors. Gene knock-out analyses of three putative effector genes failed to show major effects on pathogenicity. Details of the blast interaction transcriptome will provide insights on the mechanisms of biotrophic plant disease.</dc:description>

<dc:description>'Meyer' zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) has been the predominant cultivar used in&#xd;
the transition zone since its release in 1952, primarily because of its excellent freezing tolerance.&#xd;
Six hundred and nineteen zoysiagrass progeny were evaluated over 3 years, and 31 were&#xd;
identified from which one or more cultivars may be released with a finer texture and/or faster&#xd;
establishment and recovery rate compared to Meyer, but with comparable freezing tolerance.&#xd;
DALZ 0102 (Z. japonica), a selection tested in the 2002 National Turfgrass Evaluation Program&#xd;
(NTEP) Zoysiagrass Study has exhibited a faster establishment and recovery rate than Meyer;&#xd;
however, a lower percentage of living rhizomes and nodes was observed in DALZ 0102&#xd;
compared to Meyer at temperatures [less than or equal to]-15 C in a controlled freezing chamber experiment.&#xd;
Physiological contributors to freezing tolerance, including lipid and fatty acid composition, and&#xd;
endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) levels, were monitored in 'Cavalier' [Z. matrella (L.) Merrill]&#xd;
(cold sensitive, LT[subscript50] = -9.6 C) and Meyer (cold tolerant, LT[subscript50] = -16.2 C) rhizomes during cold&#xd;
acclimation over two years. The most abundant lipids in Zoysia rhizomes were digalactosyl&#xd;
diacylglycerol (DGDG), monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC),&#xd;
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidic acid (PA). It has been suggested that DGDG&#xd;
and PC adopt bilayer structure; whereas MGDG, PE and PA have higher tendency to form a nonbilayer,&#xd;
hexagonal II (HII) phase, which compromises bilayer structure and cell function. Greater&#xd;
fluctuations in PC, PA, and the ratio of PC to (PE + PA) were observed in Zoysia rhizomes&#xd;
during cold acclimation compared to the galactolipids (DGDG and MGDG). Changes in PC and&#xd;
PA levels and the ratio of PC to (PE + PA) were more gradual in Meyer than in Cavalier in one&#xd;
year of the two-year study. There was no clear relationship between double bond indices (DBI)&#xd;
and LT[subscript50] in Cavalier and Meyer; thus, DBI might not be a good indicator of freezing tolerance.&#xd;
Abscisic acid (ABA) levels were higher in Meyer than in Cavalier on all sampling dates and were&#xd;
significantly correlated with LT[subscript50] (r = -0.65, P = 0.01).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Escherichia coli O157 is a major foodborne pathogen.  The bovine gut is the primary reservoir and the organism is shed in the feces, which serves as the major source of contamination.  The objectives of our research on E. coli O157 were to 1) determine prevalence and characterize presence in the rectoanal mucosa of cattle, 2) rationalize preferential prevalence in the hindgut, 3) evaluate fecal prevalence and concentration in relation to carcass contamination 4) determine the efficacy of preharvest intervention strategies to reduce fecal prevalence and/or concentration in cattle.  We determined that E. coli O157 isolated from the rectoanal mucosa were similar to fecal isolates.  We evaluated methods of enumeration in cattle feces to identify fecal samples with > 10[superscript3] and 10[superscript4] CFU of E. coli O157/g.  We observed that prevalence of E. coli O157 on carcasses was correlated with high-shedders.  We identified gluconic acid as a substrate which stimulates growth of E. coli O157 in fermentations with ruminal microbial or fecal microbial inocula from cattle.  This may explain the preference to persist or colonize the hindgut because gluconic acid is a component of colonic mucin.  Additionally, we evaluated the effects of cattle diets (two grain types and two grain processing methods), which present different amounts of fermentable starch to the hindgut, on prevalence of E. coli O157.  Dry-rolled grain-based diets reduced prevalence of E. coli O157, possibly because of increased flow of starch to the hindgut.  Competitive exclusion cultures of E. coli in in vitro fermentations reduced E. coli O157 in ruminal microbial inoculum, but in fecal microbial inoculum cultures were only efficacious when gluconic acid also was added.  Lastly, we evaluated a vaccine which targeted the siderophore receptor/porin proteins of E. coli O157.  The vaccine reduced prevalence, the total number of days cattle tested positive, and the total number of days cattle were identified as high-shedders of E. coli O157.  In summary, our research adds further knowledge to the literature about E. coli O157 in the hindgut, provides methods to identify high-shedding animals, demonstrates the importance of high-shedding animals, and offers information about potential preharvest interventions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine the factors influencing acculturative stress among international students from the international student perspective. This study explored how acculturative stressors, social support and stress are related. In addition the study examined the significant socio-cultural and demographic predictors of acculturative stress. The Berry's acculturation stress research framework and Bronfenbrenner's ecological perspective were used to guide this study.&#xd;
Data was collected using an online survey from international students across a cohort of eleven U.S universities. Of the 986 students who took the survey, only complete data from 606 students were included in the current study. Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were employed to summarize and test the proposed hypotheses. &#xd;
The findings indicated that students who were experiencing increased levels of difficulty with the acculturative stressors were more likely to experience higher levels of stress. In addition international students who reported high levels of collective social support were more likely to display less impact of acculturative stressors on acculturative stress. However, the unique moderating influences of various types of social support (family, friends and important others) on the relationship between acculturative stressor and stress was not supported. The findings on the socio-cultural and demographic predictors of acculturative stress suggested that using the assimilation mode and identifying marital status in the "others" category was indicative of lower stress. Lower income and self identified lower social class prior and during acculturation were predictive of higher acculturative stress levels.&#xd;
Findings highlight the fundamental role of the international student's social context and its impact on his/her acculturation process and outcomes. The findings have implications for professionals and scholars who work with international students in practice, education and policy. Suggestions for future research are also included.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cross-national phenomenon is often cloaked behind the shadow of interracial phenomenon. This study specifically focused on the cross-national phenomenon, especially the couples' experience as parents of their mixed-heritage child. In the process of exploration, both the couples' marital and parenting experience were captured. By employing a qualitative approach and analysis, eight cross-national couples who lived in the Midwest were recruited and interviewed about their parenting experience. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and analyzed. The results of the study produced five categories of cross-national couples' experience: perceptions, relational dynamics, parent/child relationship issues, contextual influences, and essential coping strategies. By utilizing systemic perspectives, the descriptive findings were further analyzed in order to describe the potential interactions among categories, themes, and concepts. The analysis revealed five essential domains that were integral to the couples' cross-national parenting experience including, the individual domain, the couple domain, the child domain, the environmental domain, and the parenting domain. It is evident that the majority of cross-national couples did not always perceive their relational context in term of being mixed or cross-national but rather simply as couple or parent. It was not until the birth of their children that couples typically began to face the reality of being cross-national couples. Participants identified both unique strengths and challenges of being parents of mixed-heritage children. The findings suggested that the experience of cross-national parents are both common as well as unique, shaped by the multifaceted domains and their interactions. The systemic analysis revealed those idiosyncratic domains and factors within those domains. Although all of these domains appeared equally significant in contributing to the parenting quality and experience, the couple, the parenting and the environmental domains appeared to have the greatest influence. The more couples work toward cohesion and harmony in the different domains of their lives, the more favorable their experience was. Clinical implications for therapists working with cross-national couples and parents, utilizing the systemic framework, are discussed. Recommendations for future studies are also presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between chronic stressors-believed to be a condition present by race, sex, and social class and Well-being when mediated by individual resources and perceptions. Additionally, this study examined the utility of the proposed ABC-WB Model of Well-Being adapted from the ABC-X Model.  &#xd;
The data used in this dissertation were gleaned from the 2004 General Social Survey which contained a weighted sample of 3,260 respondents.  Several observed indicators were used to define each of the latent constructs corresponding to theoretical variables of the ABC-WB model.  Each of these constructs contributed to the overall model in some way despite some inconsistent findings.  The utility of the model was examined with multiple indicators for Stressor.&#xd;
 None of the four research hypotheses were supported by the tested models.   The data models were then respecified.  This process did not produce any working structural models as well.  Nevertheless, the findings revealed that well-being was an important factor to consider in the ABC-WB model.  Despite the shortcomings of the model the stressor measurement revealed a direct but mild relationship with well-being.   In all the models, Stressor was tempered by Resources and Perceptions both of which had a strong relationship with well-being. The selected models suggested that despite the lack of fit, largely to do with data restrictions rather than model specificity, the overall ABC-WB model has research potential.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objectives of this study were to determine exercise intensity of common gardening tasks in older adults and to investigate if older gardeners meet the physical activity (PA) recommendations (intensity and time) through their daily gardening. Kinds of gardening tasks, body postures, and bodily pain while gardening of older gardeners were investigated and the possibility of gardening as a predictor for a physically active lifestyle and life satisfaction in older adults was determined. &#xd;
Older participants were randomly recruited from the community of Manhattan, KS. To determine the exercise intensity of gardening, the heart rates of older adults were measured by radiotelemetry during gardening or garden tasks, and then oxygen uptake and energy expenditure were measured via indirect calorimetry using a submaximal graded exercise test. Overall health conditions by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), hand functions by hydraulic hand dynamometer and pinch gauge, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were measured. An observational study and weekly logs were conducted to study kinds of gardening, postures, and bodily pain of older gardeners. The Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Senior (CHAMPS) questionnaire was used to measure leisure-time PAs (frequency per week of all PAs and calories expended per week in all PAs). &#xd;
In conclusion, the nine gardening tasks were found to be low to moderate intensity PA in healthy older adults (1.6 ± 3.6 METs). Gardening observed was moderate intensity (3.8 ± 1.4 METs) PA in older adults and the subjects met the PA recommendation, which is at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity PA on most days of the week through their daily gardening (moderate intensity; average 33 hrs/wk in May and 15 hrs/wk in June and July). The older gardeners showed higher values for hand function and some SF-36 domains (physical function, bodily pain, and physical summary) than older non-gardeners. Gripping, stooping, lifting, stretching, walking, standing, kneeling, sitting, and squatting were observed while older adults gardened and lower back pain was the main bodily pain reported. Furthermore, gardening was found to be a predictor for leading a physically active lifestyle and high life satisfaction in older adults.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA) and Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM) are key components of  The United States Army's Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Program, which outlines its commitment to support the sustainable use of military training lands.  The primary purpose of the RTLA Program is to provide information and recommendations regarding the condition of training lands to range managers for scheduling of training areas and monitoring the effectiveness of rehabilitation projects.  The goal of the LRAM component of ITAM is to reduce the long-term impacts of training on installations through the implementation of improvements to vegetation cover and repairs to landscape damage in disturbed areas.  Fort Riley Military Installation, located in the largest remaining expanse of tallgrass prairie in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas, is a major training reservation, with seventy percent of its 40,434 ha used for mechanized maneuvers.  A randomized complete block design composed of M1A1 tank traffic in a figure-eight pattern during wet and dry soil conditions was established in each of two soil types, a silty clay loam and a silt loam, and recovery of physical, chemical, and biological indicator variables was monitored from 2005 through 2007.  In a second study, the effectiveness of LRAM procedures, including leveling, mulching, and reseeding, was evaluated following wheeled vehicle disturbance.  The goals of this study were to identify disturbance indicators appropriate for assessing soil quality and, based on the status of these indicators, develop a method for modeling the stage and rate of ecological degradation and potential response to remediation.  Disturbance increased significantly during wet compared to dry soil conditions, for increased traffic intensity, and for curve compared to straight-a-way areas in both soil types.  The greatest impacts were on above and below ground community structure, providing an effective bioindicator of ecosystem health for military training land managers.  Remediation of wheeled vehicle disturbance with leveling and mulching, but not reseeding, increased total vegetation production.  The tallgrass prairie typically is considered to be among the most resilient of military training lands, but resiliency is dependent upon soil type and training conditions, and may require longer periods of recovery than previously thought.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With increased focus on food safety and protection, the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has examined the possibility of removing the exemption for elevators pertaining to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).  The objective of this thesis was to determine the extent to which Kansas Elevators have adopted GMPs.  &#xd;
To accomplish the objective of this thesis, information from an online survey completed by 42 elevators was summarized and analyzed.  The information that was collected focused on the general classification of the elevators, grain safety programs, pest control programs and procedures, operational methods and personal practices, and maintenance of the facilities and equipment.  Correlation coefficients were computed to determine if there were any significant correlations between elevator characteristics and GMPs.&#xd;
The study found that many of the elevators surveyed do not comply with the GMP requirements, and would require more resources in order to do so.  Little connection was made between classification information such as size, location, or number of employees and GMP implementation.  The significant correlations found were between HACCP and Pest Management, and HACCP and Traceability.  The main limitation of this thesis was the small number of survey participants.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This qualitative, ethnographic study explored home literacy environments. The following question guided the research: In what ways do literacy activities manifest themselves in homes of low-income, urban, Mexican American kindergarten students?  Sub questions helped the researcher further understand the home literacy environment:&#xd;
•	As acts of literacy take place in the home, what types of parent-child interactions are occurring? &#xd;
•	How does the role of siblings impact the literacy activities that occur in the home?&#xd;
•	How does the level of education of the parent effect literacy activities of the home?&#xd;
The research employed qualitative methods of data collection: interviews, participant observation and field notes.  Surveys were also used to help understand the home literacy activities.  A total of eleven families participated in the research.  After completing the survey, the families were contacted and home visits were held.  During these home visits, the participant observer asked semi-structured interview questions and also observed a parent-child book reading session.  The visits were completed for each family between September, 2006 and March, 2007. Translators were used as needed.  &#xd;
     The following themes emerged:  1) Reading with My Mom; 2) My Mom Reads and Writes Other Things, Too; 3) We Talk A Lot at My House; 4) We Go to the Library; 5) My Sisters and Brothers Read to Me; 6) I use English and Spanish with My Brothers and Sisters; 7) My Mama Studied to be a Pre-School Teacher. Regardless of education level mothers read to their children, used literacy in other ways, and made sure their children went to the library.  Parents also took time to talk with their children and storytelling was evident in the homes.  Siblings were important to the literacy development of their kindergarten brothers and sisters by reading to them and building English oral proficiency. The education level of the mother mattered only because of the subject studied after high school.  &#xd;
The themes found in the research are described in detail.  Discussion, conclusions, implications, and recommendations for further research were provided.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Male and female Phodopus campbelli were investigated for kin recognition abilities, assessed by kin discrimination of bedding, urine, fecal, or midventral glandular secretion odors. Using a habituation-discrimination paradigm, subjects were presented either the odors of a pair of their own brothers (C[subscript 1]) or a pair of brothers that were unrelated to them (C[subscript 2]). All subjects were then presented with a final test discrimination odor from a male donor unrelated to themselves or the first donors. All subjects differentiated between the bedding and glandular odors of two unrelated males, regardless of condition assignment. Subjects did not statistically differentiate between the odors of two brothers. These results suggest Phodopus campbelli are capable of recognizing kin based on bedding and midventral gland odors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Electronic animal identification systems are becoming more common in livestock auction&#xd;
markets because of increased numbers of cattle being electronically identified. More cattle are being individually identified because of increasing enrollment in marketing alliances and&#xd;
verification programs. Also, the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has increased&#xd;
awareness and perhaps use of electronic identification. In this study, individual characteristics of&#xd;
livestock markets were analyzed to determine how they relate to a livestock market operator's&#xd;
views, concerns, and knowledge of the NAIS as well as adoption of RFID reading equipment.&#xd;
Investments in RFID tagging services and RFID reading equipment by livestock markets were&#xd;
estimated and price premiums associated with RFID tagged and preconditioned cattle were&#xd;
estimated. Data were from a national survey of livestock auction markets and cattle transaction&#xd;
data were obtained from three Kansas livestock markets.&#xd;
Auction markets that indicated they currently plan to add a RFID tagging service are&#xd;
likely to have more knowledge of the NAIS program standards, how to adopt the NAIS&#xd;
practices, and the probable costs involved. Managers of facilities that sell a large volume of&#xd;
livestock annually tend to have a higher level of understanding of how to adopt the NAIS&#xd;
practices and be more knowledgeable of the NAIS standards than operators of smallvolume&#xd;
facilities. Managers of markets that have operating RFID reader systems tend to be more&#xd;
understanding of how to adopt the NAIS practices and of costs associated with adopting the&#xd;
NAIS. Livestock market managers tend to be highly concerned that adoption of individual&#xd;
animal identification systems will adversely impact sale speed and tend to view the NAIS as a&#xd;
threat to their business. Large volume&#xd;
facilities, facilities that have registered their premises, and&#xd;
facilities that plan to add a RFID tagging service are more likely to adopt RFID reader systems.&#xd;
Economies of scale exist in RFID system adoption and RFID tagging services for auction&#xd;
markets. Preconditioned and RFID tagged cattle brought a significant premium at only one of&#xd;
three facilities where data were collected.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study describes and maps the process journalists employ when deciding issues of coverage, content, and treatment of news at community newspapers within the context of community standards. Much scholarship has been devoted to how journalists should make ethical decisions of news judgment in accordance with moral, ethical, and social responsibility theory. But little has been done in the way of describing and mapping how journalists – specifically, community journalists – actually make these on-deadline news decisions and how the concept of community standards plays into those decisions. Through the use of naturalistic inquiry methodology, in this case, a triangulation of qualitative depth interview methods – informant and ethnographic – within the context of society, this research describes the factors considered by community journalists when faced with decisions of news judgment, how that process takes place, and how and where community standards fit into that process. Data indicate that values and value-based moral and ethical reasoning are tempered by at least three considerations in the decision-making process: (1) how coverage and treatment will affect the journalist, (2) how coverage and treatment will affect others, and (3) the public instructional value, before being filtered through a screen of community standards prior to the final rendering of a news judgment decision. Furthermore, findings offer a base on which to construct a model of community journalism decision making, useful for study and discussions of ethical decision making among community journalism scholars, instructors, and students, and for its applications in practical situations by future or novice community journalists.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis provides a description of Visual EMU, a graphical user interface for the peridynamic EMU code.  The peridynamic model is a fundamental method for computational mechanical analysis that makes no assumption of continuous or small deformation behavior and has no requirement for the concepts of stress and strain. The model does not require spatial derivatives and instead uses integral equations. A force density function, called the pairwise force function, is postulated to act between each pair of infinitesimally small particles if the particles are closer together than some finite distance. A spatial integration process is employed to determine the total force acting upon each particle and a time integration process is employed to track the positions of the particles due to the applied body forces and applied displacements. EMU is a computer code developed by Sandia National Laboratories that implements the peridynamic model. Visual EMU is a pre-processor for the EMU code that allows any user to enter all parameters and visualize the resulting material regions, peridynamic grid, and a preview of resulting nodes. Visual EMU can be used before starting a lengthy solution with potential errors.  The language, visual layout, and code design of Visual EMU are described along with two examples and their results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Throughout this report, I focused on the effects that the loss of a parent has on an&#xd;
adolescent during the various stages of adolescent development. Drawing upon research&#xd;
already completed on divorce during adolescence, I speculated on the similarities and&#xd;
differences between losing a parent through divorce or death during the adolescent stages&#xd;
of development. Loss by any means is tragic and life altering. However, as I attempted&#xd;
to illustrate, it was even more defining when encountered during the period of&#xd;
adolescence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>On 16 January 1991, a coalition of nations led by the United States launched a series of air strikes against Iraq to force that country to withdraw from Kuwait.  What followed was an intense aerial bombardment of Iraqi military and civilian infrastructure which lasted until 24 February when the coalition began a ground offensive.  After four days of ground fighting Iraq withdrew from Kuwait.  American pictorial print media created a historical interpretation of the 1991 Persian Gulf War in the sense that selected images were immediately published to a broad audience and these images provided an acceptable story of the war.  Perceptions of an Air Campaign examines the cultural meanings of the air war and how these meanings took shape in the narrative pictorial print media produced.  The narrative is intricately related to the legacy of the Vietnam War.  For generations, Americans viewed contemporary war, politics, foreign affairs, and culture through their memories of the U.S. defeat in Vietnam.  President George H.W. Bush guaranteed the U.S. public that the Gulf War was consciously being constructed to avoid a conflict similar to Vietnam.  According to the president, the United States was going to war with enough resources for a swift and decisive victory, thereby avoiding the Vietnam pitfall of an open-ended conflict.  Pictorial print media articulated a narrative displaying U.S. military strength and dominance that fulfilled Bush’s promise.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Integer programming (IP) has been and continues to be widely used by industries to minimize cost and effectively manage resources. Faster computers and innovative IP techniques have enabled the solution to many large-scale IPs. However, IPs are NP-hard and many IPs require exponential time to solve.&#xd;
&#xd;
Lifting is one of the most widely used techniques that helps to reduce computational time and is widely applied in today's commercial IP software. Lifting was first introduced by Gomory for bounded integer programs and a theoretical and computationally intractible technique to simultaneously lift sets of variables was introduced by Zemel in 1978.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents a new algorithm called the Maximal Simultaneous Lifting Algorithm (MSLA), to simultaneously uplift sets of binary integer variables into a cover inequality. These lifted inequalities result in strong inequalities that are facet defining under fairly moderate assumptions.&#xd;
&#xd;
A computational study shows that this algorithm can find numerous strong inequalities for random Knapsack (KP) instances. The pre-processing time observed for these instances is less than 1/50th of a second, which is negligible. These simultaneously lifted inequalities are easy to find and incorporating these cuts to KP instances reduced the solution time by an average of 41%. Therefore, implementing MSLA should be highly beneficial for large real-world problems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Konza Prairie is one of the few areas in the United States were natural landscape of the&#xd;
area is still intact. Human action on changing the landscapes in this area is limited and much of&#xd;
the land remains as native grassland. In spite of its natural existence, this area is not completely&#xd;
isolated from the rest of the world. Changes that are taking place in climate will eventually have&#xd;
the same effect to this region as well as other human populated areas. Increase in carbon&#xd;
concentration in the air has resulted to increase in temperature, this increase in temperature&#xd;
increases the evaporation from the sea, oceans and the ice capes. As the atmospheric water vapor&#xd;
changes the precipitation pattern also change.&#xd;
Changes in precipitation due to climate change will result to change in hydrology and&#xd;
hydraulics of the streams and groundwater flow regime. Precipitation provides surface runoff&#xd;
and groundwater infiltration, which recharge the cracked limestone aquifer present in the Konza&#xd;
area. The infiltration water moves trough the cracked rocks and eventually reach the creeks such&#xd;
as Kings Creek and flow to the Kansas River. Increase in precipitation will result to increase in&#xd;
surface runoffs and more groundwater recharge. Decrease in precipitation will result to decrease&#xd;
in both surface and groundwater.&#xd;
To examine changes in groundwater elevation as recharge change in Konza, a&#xd;
groundwater model was developed based on erosion impact calculator (EPIC) ecological model&#xd;
and SLIT groundwater model. EPIC model estimates the deep percolation (recharge) as 12% and&#xd;
total runoff to about 24% of the annual average precipitation. The annual average recharge&#xd;
values from EPIC were used in SPLIT to simulate results for the groundwater elevation at Konza&#xd;
prairie. Field wells elevation were use to calibrate the SPLIT results. By estimating the hydraulic&#xd;
permeability value to 0.546m/d the field well measurements and SPLIT simulated groundwater&#xd;
elevation results provide a good match. After calibration max and min recharge together with a&#xd;
5-years moving average were used to examine the changes in groundwater elevation as recharge&#xd;
changes. Future study intends to use the calibrated Konza groundwater model and the forecasted&#xd;
climate data to simulate result for groundwater elevation as climate changes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the intensification of communication in information systems, interest in security has&#xd;
increased. The notion of noninterference is typically used as a baseline security policy to formalize&#xd;
confidentiality of secret information manipulated by a program. This notion, based on&#xd;
ideas from classical information theory, has first been introduced by Goguen and Meseguer&#xd;
(1982) as the absence of strong dependency (Cohen, 1977).&#xd;
"information is transmitted from a source to a destination only when variety in the&#xd;
source can be conveyed to the destination" Cohen (1977)&#xd;
Building on the notion proposed by Goguen and Meseguer, a program is typically said to be&#xd;
noninterfering if the values of its public outputs do not depend on the values of its secret inputs.&#xd;
If that is not the case then there exist illegal information flows that allow an attacker, having&#xd;
knowledge about the source code of the program, to deduce information about the secret inputs&#xd;
from the public outputs of the execution.&#xd;
In contrast to the vast majority of previous work on noninterference which are based on&#xd;
static analyses (especially type systems), this PhD thesis report considers dynamic monitoring&#xd;
of noninterference. A monitor enforcing noninterference is more complex than standard&#xd;
execution monitors.&#xd;
"the information carried by a particular message depends on the set it comes from.&#xd;
The information conveyed is not an intrinsic property of the individual message."&#xd;
Ashby (1956).&#xd;
The work presented in this report is based on the combination of dynamic and static information&#xd;
flow analyses. The practicality of such an approach is demonstrated by the development&#xd;
of a monitor for concurrent programs including synchronization commands. This report also&#xd;

<dc:description>Glass can be beautiful and strong, so why is it not used more often as a structural&#xd;
material? Most often the reasoning is because people fear its perceived fragile and dangerous&#xd;
nature. Although this is the perception, it is far from the reality. Structurally designed glass can&#xd;
even withstand higher loads than steel. The following report will present several advantages of&#xd;
using glass as a structural material. Because understanding the history of glass can foster a&#xd;
greater understanding of where the future of glass is headed, it is discussed early on. After this,&#xd;
the focus is on how to make a mixture of molten liquid into a structural member. The&#xd;
manufacturing process is at the root of the strength of glass, as are the material properties. The&#xd;
composition and properties of glass are addressed before discussing various uses of glass as a&#xd;
structural material. As architects begin to ask for more structural glass in their projects, structural&#xd;
engineers must be prepared to design the systems or to specify performance criteria to a specialty&#xd;
engineer. To aid in design, published guidelines and testing must be utilized and are therefore&#xd;
discussed. In a glass structural system, the glass is not the only aspect that needs an engineer's&#xd;
attention. Connections present a special challenge when designing with structural glass, but&#xd;
several different forms of connections have been successfully demonstrated in construction. To&#xd;
tie all the previous topics together, three examples of structural glass systems are presented.&#xd;
Europe has been using glass as a structural material for years, but the United States has been&#xd;
slow to follow the trend. Glass has been proven to work as a structural material that can create&#xd;
impressive visual impact. With the support of the glass manufacturing industry and the courage&#xd;
of design engineers, the United States could easily start a movement towards building with&#xd;
structural glass.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Integer programming is a useful tool for modeling and optimizing real world problems.  Unfortunately, the time required to solve integer programs is exponential, so real world problems often cannot be solved.  The knapsack problem is a form of integer programming that has only one constraint and can be used to strengthen cutting planes for general integer programs.  These facts make finding new classes of facet-defining inequalities for the knapsack problem an extremely important area of research.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis introduces three set inequalities (TSI) and an algorithm for finding them.  Theoretical results show that these inequalities will be of dimension at least 2, and can be facet defining for the knapsack problem under certain conditions.  Another interesting aspect of these inequalities is that TSIs are some of the first facet-defining inequalities for knapsack problems that are not based on covers.  Furthermore, the algorithm can be extended to generate multiple inequalities by implementing an enumerative branching tree.  &#xd;
&#xd;
A small computational study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of three set inequalities.  The study compares running times of solving integer programs with and without three set inequalities, and is inconclusive.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Motorists generally follow the guidance provided by the pavement markings while traveling on roads. Under certain circumstances, construction joints may be necessary in concrete pavements, which are generally designed to be coincident with the pavement markings. At some locations, however, the construction joints may not exactly match the pavement markings. These situations may create confusion in the minds of drivers, which may lead them to follow joints instead of the markings. In the absence of detailed studies on this topic, an effort was made in the present study to evaluate the effects of unmatched longitudinal construction joints and pavement markings on the lateral position of vehicles. &#xd;
Sites having the characteristics of unmatched longitudinal construction joints and pavement markings were identified, and detailed data were collected at one of the sites. Video camera technique was used for capturing the movements of vehicles along the test site for longer durations. The video tapes were later reduced in the laboratory to extract necessary information. The distance to the right side of the vehicles from right curb of the road, the type of vehicle, presence of vehicles in the adjacent lane, weather and light conditions, and the movement of the vehicles immediately after traversing the section of the road having unmatched longitudinal construction joints and pavement markings were the main parameters observed while reducing the data. Two surveys were also conducted for gathering the opinions of some practitioners and engineers on the issue. &#xd;
Statistical analyses were carried out using t-tests to evaluate if there were differences. Several comparisons were made for different types of vehicles based on various conditions. The analysis results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the actual and expected distances to the center-line of vehicles, implying that the lateral position of vehicles may have been affected by the joints.&#xd;
A model was also developed to determine the lateral position of the vehicles by considering the parameters used in the analysis. Based on the survey results and analysis of field data, it was found that the lateral position of vehicles may have been affected by the unmatched joints and pavement markings.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Over the last twenty-five years, the environment for banking has changed radically. In the 1980s, legislation was enacted to permit both interstate branching and combinations of banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. A generally strong economy, as well as deregulation, led to marked improvements in bank profitability and capital positions. At the same time, however, the deregulation of products and markets intensified competition among banks and between banks and nonbank financial companies. This, combined with improved information technology, applications for banking, accelerated the consolidation of the banking industry through mergers and acquisitions and set the stage for the establishment of huge banking firms of unprecedented size and complexity. &#xd;
While processes such as mergers and acquisitions decreased the number of firms, competition between these firms prompted the growth of new establishments in banking and financial services. While a larger proportion of the literature has focused on the structural and regulatory changes among firms that have arose during this transformation, little attention has been given to the factors that affect the location of physical establishments. This is particularly the case in relation to the location of new banking establishments in the nonmetropolitan U.S. It is the intention of this thesis to come to a better understanding of the factors that affect the locations of these establishments, in hopes of adding more insight into the process of bank establishment growth.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper a regularized spectral estimation formula and a regularized iterative algorithm &#xd;
for band-limited extrapolation are presented. The ill-posedness of the problem is taken into account. First &#xd;
a Fredholm equation is regularized. Then it is transformed to a differential equation in the &#xd;
case where the time interval is R. A fast algorithm to solve the differential equation &#xd;
by the finite differences is given and a regularized spectral estimation formula is obtained. &#xd;
Then a regularized iterative extrapolation algorithm is introduced and compared with the  &#xd;
Papoulis and Gerchberg algorithm.  A time-frequency regularized  extrapolation  algorithm&#xd;
is presented in the two-dimensional case. The Gibbs phenomenon is analyzed.&#xd;
Then the time-frequency regularized extrapolation algorithm is applied to image restoration&#xd;
and compared with other algorithms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Silicon is the primary semiconductor material used to fabricate integrated circuits (ICs). The quality of integrated circuits depends directly on the quality of silicon wafers. A series of processes are required to manufacture the high-quality silicon wafers.&#xd;
Chemical mechanical polishing is currently used to manufacture the silicon wafers as the final material removal process to meet the ever-increasing demand for flatter wafers and lower prices. A finite element analysis has been conducted to study the effects of influencing factors (including Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the polishing pad, thickness of the pad, and polishing pressure) on the wafer flatness. In addition, an experimental study was carried out on the effects of process variables (including wafer rotation speed, pad rotation speed, the temperature of the cooling wafer in polishing table, polishing pressure, and the slurry flow rate) on material removal rate (MRR) in polishing of silicon wafers. The results from this study show that the polishing pressure and the pad speed are the most significant factors affecting the MRR.&#xd;
The polishing pad is one of the most critical factors in planarizing the wafer surface. It transports the slurry and interacts with the wafer surface. When the number of polished wafers increases, the pad is glazed and degraded and hence the polishing quality is decreased. The pad properties are changed during the process. The measuring methods for the pad properties including pad thickness monitoring, elastic properties and hardness are reviewed. Elasticity of two types of pads are measured and compared.  &#xd;
The poor flatness problems such as tapering, edge effect, concave or convex wafer shape were investigated. Finite element models were developed to illustrate the effects of polishing pad and carrier film properties on the stress and contact pressure distribution on the wafer surface. Moreover, the material removal unevenness is studied. &#xd;
A grinding-based manufacturing method has been investigated experimentally to demonstrate its potential to manufacture flat silicon wafers at a lower cost. It has been demonstrated that the site flatness on the ground wafers (except for a few sites at the wafer center) could meet the stringent specifications for future silicon wafers. One of the problems is the poor flatness at the wafer center: central dimples on ground wafers. A finite element model is developed to illustrate the generation mechanisms of central dimples. Then, effects of influencing factors (including Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the grinding wheel segment, dimensions of the wheel segment, grinding force, and chuck shape) on the central dimple sizes are studied. Pilot experimental results are presented to substantiate the predicted results from the finite element model. This provides practical guidance to eliminate or reduce central dimples on ground wafers.&#xd;
The study in this thesis is to understand the mechanism of CMP and grinding of silicon wafers. Improving the processes and the quality of silicon wafers are the final goals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The proposed U.S. National Animal Identification System (US-NAIS) has generated many concerns among beef cattle producers. The goal of the NAIS is to utilize 48-hour traceback in the event of an animal disease outbreak. The traceback would identify all animals that have had contact with the diseased animal, while linking an animal to its premises of origin. According to the Diffusion of Innovation theory, getting a new idea adopted, even when it has clear advantages, is often very difficult. However, by adopting innovations relatively sooner than others in their system, the theory demonstrates marked benefits for innovators and early adopters, as well as a widening of the socioeconomic gap. In this study beef producer demonstrated understanding, acceptance and adaptability to implement the US-NAIS.  Participants for the study were selected in the spring of 2006 from a mailing list of cow-calf producers with more than 100 head of cows.  BEEF Magazine provided the mailing list and a random sample of 1,000 producers was selected.  The results show a knowledge gap between the proposed system and producer understanding. Producers were also divided on support for the proposed system. When ranking their level of support on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being strongly supportive and 6 being strongly opposed, 49% of producers showed some level of support and 48% showed some level of opposition, with a mean of 3.53 (s.d. 1.67). Data also highlights a lack of understanding of the regulations and implementation procedures among producers. The results of this study brought considerable insight into the current practices and perceptions of beef cattle producers, and will be used to develop educational materials to improve their understanding of this proposed program.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Asset Management is a relatively new term in the transportation world.  It involves a systematic approach to maintaining, upgrading and operating all transportation assets (including infrastructure) cost-effectively.  With the Government Accounting Standards Board's Statement 34 (GASB 34) requiring all transportation entities to report all capital assets on their annual reports as well as the development of new software and technologies, Asset Management is becoming easier to implement and quickly becoming an important part of the transportation industry.&#xd;
In Kansas the Department of Transportation has developed and successfully utilized an Asset Management system for all assets including bridges, roadways, drainage structures and signs.  Kansas counties however, do not have the funds and personnel to implement and maintain an Asset Management system similar to that of the KDOT.  Asset Management systems have only been developed by counties with large populations, but even they have not reached the full potential of the system.  &#xd;
This thesis discusses the importance of creating and maintaining an effective Asset Management system.  Kansas counties were surveyed and asked a series of questions about their asset management systems, or lack thereof, as well as the successes and failures of these systems.  The counties were asked how they prioritize maintenance, what software they are using, and what assets they have inventoried.&#xd;
	The results of the questionnaire showed that counties with large populations have shown interest in implementing Asset Management systems and many have worked to implement such a system.  Conversely, counties with small populations that do not have the resources have not implemented Asset Management systems.  Recommendations for implementing appropriate Asset Management systems are made to counties in the three population ranges:  i) less than 5,000, ii) between 5,000 and 50,000, and iii) greater than 50,000. These include software recommendations and creating inventories of all county assets including culverts, signs and pavements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Software architectures—abstract interrelation models which decompose complex artifacts into modular functional units and specify the connections and relationships among them—have become an important factor in the development and maintenance of large scale, heterogeneous, information and computation systems. In system development, software architecture design has become a main starting point, and throughout the life-cycle of a system, conformance to the architecture is important to guarantee a system's integrity and consistency.&#xd;
&#xd;
For an effective use of software architectures in initial development and ongoing maintenance, the interrelation models themselves have to be clear, consistent, well structured, and—in case substantial functionality has to be added, reduced, or changed at any stage of the life cycle—flexible and manipulable. Further, enforcing the conformance of a software artifact to its architecture is a non-trivial task. Implementation units need to be identifiable and their association to the abstract constructs of the architecture has to be maintained. Finally, since software architectures can be employed at many different levels of abstraction, with some architectures describing systems that span over multiple different computing platforms, associations have to be flexible and abstractions have to be general enough to capture all parts and precise enough to be useful. An efficient and widely used way to employ software architecture in practice are middleware-based component architectures. System development within this methodology relies on the presence of a service layer called middleware which usually resides between operating system (possibly spanning over multiple operating systems on various platforms) and the application described by the architecture. The uniform set of logistic services provided by a middleware allows that communication and context requirements of the functional units, called components, can be expressed in terms of those services and therefore more shortly and concisely than without such a layer. Also, component development in the middleware context can focus on high-level functionality since the low-level logistics is provided by the middleware.&#xd;
&#xd;
While type systems have proved effective for enforcing structural constraints in programs and data structures, most architectural modeling frameworks include only weak notions of typing or rely on first-order logic constraint languages instead. Nevertheless, a consequent, adherent, use of typing can seamlessly enforce a wide range of constraints crucial for the structural integrity of architectures and the computation systems specified by them without the steep learning curve associated with first-order logic. Also, type systems scale better than first-order logic both in use and understandability/legibility as well as in computational complexity. This thesis describes component-oriented architecture modeling with CADENA and introduces the CADENA&#xd;
&#xd;
Architecture Language with Meta-modeling (CALM). CALM uses multi-level type systems to specify complex interaction models and enforce a variety of structural properties and consistency constraints relevant for the development of large-scale component-based systems. Further, CALM generalizes the notion of middleware-based architectures and uniformly captures and maintains complex interrelated architectures integrated on multiple, differing, middleware platforms. CADENA is a robust and extensible tool based on the concepts and notions of CALM that has been used to specify a number of industrial-strength component models and applied in multiple industrial research projects on model-driven development and software product lines.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This empirical dissertation consists of three essays on mergers and regulation in the U.S. telecommunications industry.  An abstract for each of the three essays follows.&#xd;
Essay 1:  This study has attempted to measure the productivity growth associated with 25 incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) over the period 1996-2005 using a Malmquist productivity index.  The average efficiency scores for our sample companies have not changed significantly between 1996 and 2005, which indicates that the average ILECs shows no measurable improvement in terms of optimizing their input-output combinations over time.  We find some empirical evidence of a positive merger effect, although this effect diminishes over time.  In addition, we find that non-merged firms underperform in terms of average productivity growth.&#xd;
Essay 2:  This study analyzes the merger effects for 25 ILECs over the period 1996-2005 using stochastic frontier analysis with a time-varying inefficiency model. In addition, we conduct a comparison of indices between the stochastic frontier analysis and the Malmquist index method. The empirical results indicate that the sample of telecommunications firms has experienced deterioration in average productivity growth following the mergers.  In addition, both approaches suggest that firms that do not merge underperform in terms of average productivity growth.&#xd;
Essay 3: This essay investigates whether the substitution of price cap regulation (PCR), along with other regulatory regimes, for traditional rate of return regulation (RRR) has had a measurable effect on productivity growth in the U.S. telecommunications industry.  A stochastic frontier approach, which differs from previous studies, is employed to compute efficiency change, technological progress, and productivity growth for 25 LECs over the period 1988-1998.  By examining the relationship between the change in productivity growth and regulatory regime variables, while controlling for other effects, we find that PCR and other regulatory regimes have a positive effect on productivity growth.  However, only PCR has a significant and positive effect in both contemporaneous and lagged model specifications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This project investigated the physiological and biochemical responses of three grapevine genotypes to a deficit irrigation strategy termed partial rootzone drying (PRD). The principle objectives of the project were to (1) establish if the response to PRD is a unique vine physiological response; (2) to investigate the effect of PRD on berry maturation and composition; (3) effect of PRD on vine water-use efficiency; (4) investigate the hormonal signal involved in the PRD mechanism. In addition, the project investigated the adaptation of these three grapevine genotypes to Kansas climatic conditions.  The irrigation project was conducted in both a greenhouse at Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, and field conditions in an experimental vineyard at the John C. Pair Horticultural Research Center, Haysville, Kansas. The greenhouse study was replicated four times (6 months each run) and the field study ran from the 2005/2006 season through the 2006/2007 season. Application of PRD to vines resulted in a unique physiological response distinct from other established deficit irrigation procedures such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI); however, the overall physiological responses of the vines were defined by the environmental conditions of the vineyard where the experiment occurred. Reduced water availability, low to medium vigor vines, restricted root development, and high evaporative demand were all factors in the vines response to PRD.&#xd;
Under these conditions, PRD did maintain the yield at deficit irrigation rates compared to fully irrigated vines, and was responsible for physiological changes in the vine that could have long-term implications for yield stability. The application of PRD resulted in an improvement in plant water status and maintenance of leaf function as measured by photosynthesis, stomatal conductance  and leaf water potential  throughout the season.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Morrowan middle Bloyd sandstone of northwest Arkansas records a fluvial to estuarine transition in a drowned incised valley system.  Lower portions of outcrops contain fluvially deposited, planar-tabular cross-stratified sandstone with a uni-directional southwest paleoflow.  Intervals with dune scale, intricately interwoven trough cross-stratification with northeastern paleoflow is attributed to strong tidal and wave influence in the outer estuary.  Upwards the middle Bloyd changes into a muddy mid-estuarine interval with heterolithic bedding and a bi-directional northeast-southwest paleoflow.  Overlying this interval a marine sand about one meter in thickness can be found containing bryozoan and crinoid fossils.  Overlying the middle Bloyd, the marine Dye Shale member of the Bloyd Formation marks the transition to a dominantly marine setting.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Enterococcus faecalis is one of the most frequently encountered enterococcal isolates and accounts for about 80% of enterococcal infections. Treatment of enterococcal infections has become increasingly difficult as this organism has a high incidence of antibiotic resistance. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is an essential amphiphilic polymer on the surface of most Gram positive bacteria. While the molecule's exact role is not yet fully understood, a role in cell-cell contact during conjugation enabling the spread of extra chromosomal elements has been discussed. LTA also has implications in regulating autolysis, sequestering cations to the cell surface, adhesion, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, UV sensitivity, acid tolerance, and virulence. The gene ebsG was identified in a mutant of E. faecalis with major alterations in LTA structure and decreased ability to act as a recipient in conjugative mating. ebsG codes for a 119 kDa protein with only weak homology to other surface proteins of Gram positive bacteria. Transcriptional linkage analysis indicated ebsG and its downstream genes are organized in an operon. LTA analysis reveals a higher glycosyl content of the molecule in the mutant during stationary phase. Compared to wild type OG1RF, the mutant is more sensitive to nisin, shows higher autolysis activity during stationary phase, and is better able to serve as a recipient in plasmid transfer. Our data indicate ebsG and the members of the operon play a role in LTA structure and may act to degrade LTA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It is well established that normal aging is associated with progressive increases in efferent sympathetic nerve discharge (SND). Type II diabetes, obesity, heart failure, and hypertension are pathologies that have been attributed to both the processes of aging and sympathetic dysfunction, exemplifying the importance of understanding central regulation of SND during aging. However, the central mechanisms mediating altered SND with advancing age remain unclear. The rostral ventral lateral medulla (RVLM) is a brainstem region critically involved in setting the basal level of sympathetic outflow and cardiovascular function. Indeed, the RVLM is the only presympathetic region that when bilaterally inactivated results in profound reductions in both SND and arterial pressure. Glutamatergic influences in RVLM activity are powerfully inhibited by tonic GABAergic neural inputs originating from the caudal ventral lateral medulla (CVLM); effects that are mediated by GABAA receptors located on presympathetic neuronal cell bodies within the RVLM. In the present study we proposed that reductions in GABA[subscript A] receptor subunit gene expression may reflect withdrawal of GABAergic tone in the RVLM thereby contributing to the basal sympathetic activation that occurs with advancing age. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to identify age-related changes in the constitutive expression of genes related to GABAergic and muscarinic, nicotinic and dopaminergic receptor systems due to their reported involvement in modulating GABA[subscript A] receptor function, in the RVLM of adult young (3-5 mo. old), middle-aged (12 mo. old), weight stable presenescent (24-25 mo. old) and senescent (>24 mo. old) Fischer 344 (F344) rats using a commercially available real-time PCR array. Real-time analysis revealed nonuniform and age-associated changes in the RVLM GABA, muscarinic, nicotinic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter gene expression profile between young and middle-aged F344 rats. Heterogeneous expression of genes related to these neurotransmitters was also observed between presenescent and senescent F344 rats. Our results suggest that potential changes in neurotransmitter synthesis and degradation, uptake, transport, signaling and receptor subunit composition may account for the sympathoexcitatory state that is commonly observed in the aged.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The fast advancement in computer technologies in the recent years has made the use of simulation to estimate stock/equity performances and pricing possible; however, determining the optimal exercise time and prices of American options using Monte-Carlo simulation is still a computationally challenging task due to the involved computer memory and computational complexity requirements.  At each time step, the investor must decide whether to exercise the option to get the immediate payoff, or hold on to the option until a later time.&#xd;
Traditionally, the stock options are simulated using Monte-Carlo methods and all stock prices along the path are stored, and then the optimal exercise time is determined starting at the final time period and continuing backward in time.  Also, as the number of paths simulated increases, the number of simultaneous equations that need to be solved at each time step grow proportionally.  Currently, two theoretical methods have emerged in determining the optimal exercise problem.  The first method uses the concept of least-squares approach in linear regression to estimate the value of continuing to hold on to the option via a set of randomly generated future stock prices.  Then, the value of continuing can be compared to the payoff at current time from exercising the option and a decision can be reached, which gives the investor a higher value.  The second method uses the finite difference approach to establish an exercise boundary for the American option via an artificially generated mesh on both possible stock prices and decision times.  Then, the stock price is simulated and the method checks to see if it is inside the exercise boundary.&#xd;
In this research, these two solution approaches are evaluated and compared using discrete event simulation.  This allows complex methods to be simulated with minimal coding efforts.  Finally, the results from each method are compared.  Although a more conservative method cannot be determined, the least-squares method is faster, more concise, easier to implement, and requires less memory than the mesh method.&#xd;
The motivation for this research stems from interest in simulating and evaluating complicated solution methods to the optimal exercise problem, yet requiring little programming effort to produce accurate and efficient estimation results.</dc:description>

<dc:description>High temperature and drought may reduce quality in cool-season turfgrasses during&#xd;
summer in the transition zone. Texas bluegrass hybrids (HBG) are genetic crosses between native Texas bluegrass (Poa arachnifera Torr.) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) (KBG) that resemble KBG but may have greater drought and heat resistance than other cool-season&#xd;
grasses. The objectives of four studies were to evaluate high temperature, drought, and lower mowing height effects on HBG compared with KBG ('Apollo') and tall fescue (Festuca arundincea Schreb.)(TF, 'Dynasty'), compare their rooting characteristics, and investigate their&#xd;
membrane lipid molecular species compositional differences.&#xd;
Under high temperature (35/25°C, 14h&#xd;
light/10h darkness), HBG ('Thermal Blue') had greater quality and gross photosynthesis (Pg), and lower electrolyte leakage than KBG and TF in a growth chamber study. The combination of high temperature and drought (60% ET replacement) caused rapid declines in quality, but HBG generally performed better.&#xd;
In field and greenhouse studies, TF had more roots deeper in the profile than two HBG ('Reveille' and Thermal Blue) and KBG under well-watered conditions. In the field, quality and Pg were greatest in TF among turfgrasses. Performances in quality and Pg generally ranked: TF > Reveille >= Thermal Blue = KBG.&#xd;
In a separate mowing height and drought field study, HBG (Thermal Blue) generally had lower quality and Pg than KBG at both high (7.62 cm) and low (3.81 cm) heights but particularly at the low height. Drought resistance and tolerance to low mowing in Thermal Blue was similar to or poorer than in KBG.&#xd;
Under supra-optimum temperature (35 /25°C and 40 /30°C, 14h light/10h darkness), the&#xd;
ratio of digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) to monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) was&#xd;
highest in HBG (Thermal Blue) and lowest in TF. Heat tolerance was also associated with higher phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content, higher phosphatidylglycerol (PG) content, and reduced overall unsaturation compared with heat-sensitive. Results suggest that 40 membrane lipid molecules are potential biomarkers for heat tolerance and that compositional changes in lipids in&#xd;
response to heat may contribute to differences in heat tolerance among cool-season grasses.&#xd;
Generally, studies indicated greater heat resistance, but not drought resistance, in HBG than in KBG or TF.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is known as the key hormone capable of&#xd;
causing proliferation of granulosa cells in the ovary. The classical receptor belongs to the&#xd;
G protein-coupled superfamily and is designated FSHR-1. A variant in the FSH receptor&#xd;
has been shown to be functional in mouse ovaries. The variant receptor is designated as&#xd;
FSHR-3, and when bound by FSH activates a pathway that shares similar characteristics&#xd;
to the growth factor type I receptor pathway, with no increase in cAMP. The FSHR-3&#xd;
variant activates MAPK upon binding to FSH, and causes proliferation of cells on which&#xd;
it is known to be expressed. For example ID8 mouse ovarian surface epithelium cells&#xd;
(MOSEC), a cell line that when introduced in immunocompetent mice causes tumors&#xd;
similar to human ovarian cancer and which also express FSHR-3, proliferated in response&#xd;
to FSH. The present study explored the potential for decreasing expression of FSHR-3&#xd;
protein. The RNA interference (RNAi) technique was used to insert small inhibitory&#xd;
RNA(siRNA) segments corresponding specifically to the R3 variant of the FSH receptor&#xd;
in ID8 MOSEC. Transfected cells were lysed and FSHR-3 protein was visualized using&#xd;
SDS Page and Western blotting analysis. A reduction in expression of FSHR-3 was&#xd;
observed in two of the transfection groups, with the greatest down-regulation of FSHR-3&#xd;
being 30.1%. From these preliminary results we conclude that the FSHR-3 is expressed&#xd;
on ID8 cells, and that siRNA may be useful to reduce its expression. Thus, it may be&#xd;
possible to slow the growth of FSH-responsive tumors using siRNA to target the FSHR-3 receptor.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the advancement of urbanization, many children today have limited or no&#xd;
experiences with nature or survival instincts as described by the nature (Biophilia)&#xd;
hypothesis. Today, children's preference toward landscapes may be more reflective of&#xd;
cultural experiences learned from family, teachers, or classmates, and referred to as the&#xd;
nurture hypothesis. In this research study, two visual surveys were used to investigate the&#xd;
nature vs. nurture hypotheses.&#xd;
In the first survey, 93 multicultural American children were asked to identify&#xd;
their preferred colors for symbols of bananas, tulips, birds, and trees. In the second&#xd;
survey, 202 children from American and Japanese schools were asked their visual&#xd;
preferences and emotional responses to photographs of landscapes, trees, homes, and&#xd;
nature scenes. Subjects were first, third, and sixth grade elementary school students in&#xd;
America and Japan. The effects of culture, age, and gender were evaluated. In addition,&#xd;
the relative preference and emotional impact of plants and landscapes were examined.&#xd;
In the first study, younger children preferred all colors that exist in nature.&#xd;
However, responses of the older children would support the nurture hypothesis. Older&#xd;
children selected fewer and more appropriate colors, such as yellow bananas, reflecting a&#xd;
learned behavior. Also, boys preferred blue symbols while girls selected red with higher&#xd;
frequency than other colors.&#xd;
In the second study, American children preferred the Japanese landscape and&#xd;
tree scenes, and reported more positive emotion than Japanese children toward the&#xd;
American and Japanese tree scenes. Younger American children showed more positive&#xd;
emotions toward the American home scene. Although first and third grade Japanese&#xd;
children preferred Japanese scenes, more sixth grade Japanese children preferred&#xd;
American scenes. In conclusion, visual preferences and emotional responses are&#xd;
influenced by content of photographs, and evidence supports both the nature and the&#xd;
nurture hypothesis among Japanese and American children.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this work we present a study of the geometric, electronic, vibrational and magnetic properties of several nanostructured systems for which experimental data call for a theoretical&#xd;
understanding. In order to investigate the effect of magnetic dipolar interactions on&#xd;
the magnetization of nanomagnets arranged in finite lattices, we utilize a phenomenological&#xd;
classical approach, which is based on the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Dipolar interactions&#xd;
lead to hysteretic behavior of the magnetization curves and established that the external&#xd;
field sweep rate, sample temperature, and shape anisotropy play a role in determining the specifics. Our results (derived from a classical approach) for magnets arranged in a square lattice suggest that stepped hysteresis curves do not have necessarily a quantum origin (quantum tunneling of the magnetization). We also find that in the square lattice small changes in the dipolar strength introduce sudden transitions in the magnetic hysteresis. For the examination of geometric vibrational and electronic structure of systems of interest, we turn to density functional theory (DFT), which is the leading technique for modeling nanoscale systems from first principles. We have applied DFT to either address some old&#xd;
queries of surface science, such as the dynamics of the CO-chemisorbed Cu(001) surface, or to contribute to the forefront of hydrogen-based economy through the comprehension of the growth and diffusion of Pt islets on Ru(0001), or to predict the geometric and electronic&#xd;
properties of materials to-be-created, as in the case of core-shell bimetallic nanoclusters. In the case of CO on Cu(001), although the bond has been considered to be weak enough so as to treat the adsorbate and substrate separately, our calculations are able to reproduce measurements and provide evidence that the dynamics of the molecule is influenced by the substrate and vice versa, as well as by intermolecular interactions. Taking into account&#xd;
the adsorbate-substrate interplay, has furthermore clarified issues that were pending for the clean surface and led to the correct interpretation of some features in the phonon dispersion of the chemisorbed surface. DFT has also directed us to the conclusion that the catalytic&#xd;
properties of few-atom Pt islets on Ru nanoclusters are preserved by the low probability of these islets to diffuse through the edges of the Ru nanoclusters. Moreover, the analysis of the Ag_{27}Cu_7 nanoalloy from ab initio methods has opened a wide panorama in terms of the&#xd;
geometry, coordination, energetics, and electronic structure of alloyed phases, in general,that may aid in the assembling on new materials.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Vitamin A (VA) restriction during finishing has been shown to increase marbling in cattle.  However, little work has been done to look at the effects that VA restriction might have on color shelf-life and sensory traits of beef.  This study involved 48 calves either early-weaned at 137 + 26 d or traditionally-weaned at 199 + 26 d and supplemented with either 15,400 IU/kg dry matter of VA or restricted to no supplemental VA during the finishing phase.  Cattle were harvested in two groups, and carcass data were obtained after chilling.  Strip loins and shoulder clods were retrieved, vacuum packaged, and cut into steaks after 14 d of aging.  Visual and instrumental color scores for 7 d of retail display, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values, trained sensory panel scores, and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) values were obtained.  The only differences associated with weaning group were that L* values were lower (P &lt; 0.05) on d 4 to 6 for Triceps brachii (TB) steaks from traditionally-weaned calves restricted in VA than early-weaned calves supplemented with high VA.  Both Longissimus lumborum (LL) and TB steaks from calves supplemented with high VA had darker, more tan (P &lt; 0.05) color scores after 4 d of display in PVC packaging than steaks from calves restricted in VA.  Also, a*, b* and saturation index values were lower (P &lt; 0.05) in LL steaks for the high VA treatment than those from the no supplemental VA treatment.  There was less lipid oxidation (P &lt; 0.05), as reported by TBARS, in both muscles from calves restricted in VA than muscles from calves supplemented with high VA.  No treatment effects were found for WBSF values for either muscle, and no differences existed in sensory panel traits of the TB steaks.  Sensory panel scores were less desirable (P &lt; 0.05) for myofibrillar tenderness and connective tissue amount in LL steaks from calves fed high VA than steaks from calves restricted in VA.  Dietary VA restriction during finishing has potential to increase color shelf-life and reduce lipid oxidation, with no negative effects on cooked meat sensory attributes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis is the vehicle that I have used to outline a thorough small business plan for our personal business Big Sky Shires &amp; Equine Services. While working toward my MAB Degree, I realized there were a lot of things that I could implement from the program into our business that would help us succeed in the equine industry. I was able to research the industry that we were in to gain a better understanding of how to market and plan for the future. In the back of my mind I started to ask a lot of questions and soon found that we needed a business plan that would answer many questions about the future of our business.&#xd;
The first part of the thesis is the history of the equine industry with a look at US history, outlook for the future and strategic issues affecting the industry. The second part of the thesis is a history of Big Sky Shires &amp; Equine Services. This history tells where the business has come. The third portion, of the thesis is the small business plan that is the most thorough we could put together. A lot of thought and time went into the document that we plan to implement and update quarterly as needed. The final portion of the thesis is our conclusion followed by a detailed appendix of the corresponding documents for operating our business.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Global warming and its implications have astounding consequences for the global community. Although some research has been done on the trends within environmental reporting, few studies have looked at the issue of global warming in particular.&#xd;
Global warming is a troublesome issue for reporters for a number of reasons, and hence, it is important that we delve into how newspapers cover the topic. Latin America, especially the Caribbean region, is expected to suffer extreme consequences due to global warming, yet no studies regarding global warming coverage have been done in these regions. The first purpose of this study was to discover how a Mexico newspaper frames the issue of global warming. Next, this study sought to expand the current knowledge of global warming coverage by the media. Lastly, this study sought to expand on existing literature to discover how journalists outside of the United States communicate, to the public, the issue of global warming. Based on previous studies on global warming a frame analysis was conducted to explore how the Mexico City-based newspaper Reforma covers the issue of global warming. This study identified that ecology/science and consequences are the most frequently occurring themes of coverage, while scientific conflict and North/South conflict are present, but in low frequencies and near the end of stories. This study also identified international relations as the most frequent solution to global warming, while global warming story frequencies peaked during international conferences. These results confirm previous research, which has found that news media outside of the United States tend to emphasize international relations and de-emphasize conflicts and controversies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Feedlots, animal production facilities, and agricultural lands are point and non-point sources for nutrient enrichment of surrounding waterways and result in human enhanced eutrophication.  Artificial elevation and increased enrichment from animal wastes, fertilizer, and runoff greatly increase the speed of this natural process and leads to degraded water quality, algae blooms, and fish kills.  Phosphorous is typically the limiting nutrient for plant growth, and thus is the main focus of this paper.  Phosphates enable excessive and choking plant growth that lead to depleted dissolved oxygen and excessive decaying plant matter, subsequently damaging the aquatic ecosystem.  &#xd;
&#xd;
In order to provide an inexpensive and feasible solution to minimize phosphate eutrophication, a passive, vortex generating flume has been proposed to provide the necessary mixing for the removal of phosphorus from waste waters.  Preliminary tests with dye tracers and electrolyte pulse injections have been conducted to model the flow characteristics and determine the residence time under a variety of flow conditions, angle of inclination and flow rate.&#xd;
&#xd;
The flume was modeled by two methods: four continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in series and as four CSTRs in series operating in parallel with a plug flow reactor (PFR).  The hydraulic model fit a total of five parameters to the experimental data: Residence time, the inlet concentrations of the electrolyte pulse tracer, and the injection times of the tracer to both types of reactors.&#xd;
&#xd;
The kinetic model was built based on data collected from a different study of swine lagoons using magnesium chloride to precipitate phosphorus as the mineral struvite.  The precipitation kinetics were modeled using first order and irreversible reaction and incorporated into the hydraulic model.  The vortex generating flume provided an operating space that sufficiently removed phosphorus from the waste stream.  Future work will include pilot scale testing of the model using waste streams and the investigation of a scour to minimize solid formation in the flume.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fresh cut fruits are products with minimal processing, modified by cutting, washing, packaging and refrigeration. The objective of this review is to present an overview of the available technologies for processing fresh cut fruits and technologies that could have some potential to be used in the future due to the increased consumption of fresh cut fruits.  Fresh cut products are ready to eat, have high moisture content, have lack of lethal step to eliminate microbial pathogens and have the potential for temperature abuse; all these factors make quality and safety a priority. Fresh cut products sales have increased as a consequence of increased consumption of fruits and consumer attitudes toward convenience.&#xd;
Fresh cut fruit differ from fresh fruits in that the tissue and cell integrity have may been disrupted resulting in consequences such as changes in ethylene production, respiration, membrane degradation, metabolite accumulation, water loss and microba spoilage. However, the response to cutting depends on other variables such as cultivars, maturity and raw material quality, shape of cut, sharpness of blade, temperature and atmospheric composition. Consequently, there are enzymatic changes that impact the shelf life and quality of these products.&#xd;
In addition to quality and safety the nutritional value is an important factor too because consumers demand products as close to fresh as possible. The evaluation of the nutrient losses and how to reduce them through different treatments such as the introduction of vitamins and minerals in coating treatments or other treatment has become a priority too.&#xd;
 There is a real need to find alternatives for preservation of fresh-cut fruit in order to minimize the changes that occur in the fruit tissues as a consequence of wounding. Alternatives, combined or modified methods have been proposed such as the use of alternative antibrowning, ethylene scrubbing, heat treatments, alternative antimicrobials, alternative packaging films, vacuum impregnation, osmotic dehydration, high hydrostatic pressure, use of edible coatings, radiation, bio preservation and other technologies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was influenced by the desire to better understand the factors that influence the&#xd;
salary County Extension Agents in Kansas who are employed by K-State Research and&#xd;
Extension. The purpose of the study was to determine factors or the correlation among factors&#xd;
that influence salary compensation.&#xd;
Information was retrieved regarding the 241 County Extension Agents employed in&#xd;
Kansas. Demographic data was compiled on the Extension Agents as well as the ten factors that&#xd;
could influence their salary compensation. The factors are as follows: 1. area within the state; 2.&#xd;
county population; 3. number of agents in the county; 4. director responsibilities; 5. gender; 6.&#xd;
months of Extension employment; 7. years of equivalent service outside of Kansas Extension; 8.&#xd;
change of county employment within Kansas Extension; 9. position type; and 10. level of&#xd;
education.&#xd;
Variable selection through backward elimination was performed identifying area,&#xd;
population, the number of Extension Agents in a county/district, whether the Extension Agent&#xd;
was a director, previous years of experience in an equivalent position outside of K-State&#xd;
Research and Extension, whether an Extension Agent was employed by K-State Research and&#xd;
Extension prior to their current position, months of experience in their current position with K-State&#xd;
Research and Extension, and whether an Extension Agent has a Master's degree and if that&#xd;
Master's degree was obtained prior to the start of their current position to be the most significant&#xd;
influences on salary.&#xd;
Multiple regressions of the data were then performed to determine the significant&#xd;
relationships among certain variables. The population-position-gender correlation was found to&#xd;
be significant as well as the correlation among position types and genders.&#xd;
Recommendations for further research were given including studying the affect of&#xd;
performance evaluations and cost of living on salary compensation. In addition,&#xd;
recommendations for further practices include an annual review of the salary gap among position&#xd;
types and gender to ensure equity of salary compensation. Furthermore, recommendations were&#xd;
given regarding the dispersion of the level of education and timeliness of completing a Master's&#xd;
degree salary compensation data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Throughout recent years, to minimize the cost of construction, a large number of multipurpose spaces have been built using lightweight, less expensive materials without considering or designing for noise control to mitigate any sound that is loud, unpleasant, unexpected, or undesired yet after construction is completed, noise issues are often evident within the space and, if severe enough, may render the intended function of the structure useless. To address this problem, this report is intended to introduce Owners and Facility Managers to some of the common solutions to resolve noise issues in multipurpose rooms. The report focuses on solutions for existing projects primarily, but it is also sensitive to budget constraints and the impact of renovation. Typical multipurpose rooms researched have a volume of 50,000-150,000 cubic feet and are expected to be used for speech activities, small music functions, and some physical sports activities. Therefore, this report will introduce the fundamentals of sound and room acoustics including interior surface materials and construction. Also included are typical noise issues from interior sources, solutions that can be taken within the building to attenuate noise, and the trade-offs associated with each solution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interest in commercialization of university research has accelerated since the Bayh-Dole&#xd;
Act (1980) granted authority to universities and federally-funded nonprofit institutions, among&#xd;
others, to obtain patents, grant licenses, and transfer custody of patents with the explicit purpose&#xd;
of promoting the utilization and marketing of their inventions. This interest is supported by these&#xd;
institutions' need to expand their funding sources as growth in their traditional funding has&#xd;
lagged their needs. This study seeks to assess the level of understanding of research&#xd;
commercialization and entrepreneurship aspects by the faculty researchers nearly 10 years after&#xd;
Bayh-Dole Act using a survey of university faculty. The results show that there is indeed the&#xd;
desire to move research from universities to the marketplace through technology&#xd;
commercialization and entrepreneurship, but there is need for educational programs to enhance&#xd;
the current perceptions about the commercialization and entrepreneurship among faculty. We&#xd;
show that this need is independent of the demographic characteristics of faculty but influenced&#xd;
the university's policies covering intellectual property and commercialization.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The DALI (Digital Addressable Lighting Interface) protocol has set forth the requirements for a digital fluorescent ballast that out performs its predecessors with respect to flexibility and functionality.  The advantages of a DALI lighting control system range from advanced dimming capabilities and daylight sensing to saving money in energy and maintenance costs.  A DALI lighting control system can also be beneficial to designers when trying to meet the requirements of code or recommended practices.  &#xd;
The information in this report will help designers decide when to consider using a DALI lighting control system.  This report covers topics such as the advantages of digitally addressable lighting, the equipment required to make a DALI system work, the limitations and drawbacks of DALI, cost information on installing and using a DALI system, and how DALI can help meet code and recommended practices, and concludes with a case study demonstrating how a DALI system has the potential to save money in energy costs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Highly expansive soils can severely damage the foundations which they support. These&#xd;
damages create unnecessary maintenance cost to the owner and can be detrimental to the&#xd;
building superstructure. Post-tensioned ribbed mat foundations are commonly used in light&#xd;
commercial construction in areas in the United States that have highly expansive soils. Mild reinforced&#xd;
ribbed mat foundations are rarely used in these areas. This report investigates why&#xd;
post-tensioned ribbed mat foundations are more common in these areas than mild-reinforced&#xd;
ribbed mat foundations. The approach to this investigation is a design example which designs&#xd;
and compares the two foundation types. The design example is a typical 2-story office building&#xd;
located in Dallas, Texas, which is an area that has highly expansive soils. First, a post-tensioned&#xd;
ribbed mat foundation is designed for the office building. Next, a mild-reinforced ribbed mat&#xd;
foundation is designed for the same building. A comparison is done between the two&#xd;
foundations based on serviceability, strength requirements and construction costs. The findings&#xd;
in the comparison is that post-tensioning is a more economical and constructible method. Using&#xd;
mild-reinforcement requires the use of shear reinforcement in the ribs which is not typical in&#xd;
foundation design and construction and is less economical, and additional reinforcement in the&#xd;
slab is needed to resist bending stresses which is also less economical. The finding of the report&#xd;
is that of the two foundation types, the post-tensioned ribbed mat foundation is the better design&#xd;
based on the three areas of interest listed above. The use of a mild-reinforced mat foundation&#xd;
would require construction procedures that are not typical and would be less economical.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objective of our study was to explore relationships between Japanese color score (JCS) and pork-quality attributes and develop equations to predict JCS.  Pork carcass traits in population one (n = 781) was used to develop prediction equations and population two (n = 684) was used to test the equations for accuracy.  Pearson's correlation coefficients found firmness, ultimate pH, drip loss percentage, L*, a*, b*, hue angle, and chroma were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) correlated to JCS.  Correlation loading found 96% of the variation in firmness, pH, drip loss percentage, L*, a*, b*, and hue angle explained 81% of the variation in JCS.  Three prediction equations were developed using these traits.  Averages for population one traits were used to develop the initial prediction equations.  Predicted JCS, which fell within [plus or minus]0.25 of the actual JCS, were retained and multiple linear regression (MLR) was run, resulting in the first prediction equations.  Data from population two were then used to evaluate the success of these equations.  Equation one using firmness, pH, drip loss percentage, L*, a*, b*, and hue angle was: JCS = 12.698 – (0.00007199 x drip loss) + (0.09008 x pH) – (0.01128 x firmness) – (0.226 x L*) + (0.06923 x a*) – (0.0201 x b*) + (0.02143 x hue angle); r[superscript]2 = 0.916.  For the test population, 98.53 and 67.25% of the observations were predicted within [plus or minus]0.50 and 0.25 of the actual JCS, respectively.  The second prediction equation, developed utilizing instrumental color measures of L*, b*, and hue angle was: JCS = 15.255 – (0.259 x L*) – (0.213 x b*) + (0.02518 x hue angle); r[superscript]2 = 0.931.  For test population, 92.40 and 55.70% of the observations were predicted within [plus or minus]0.50 and 0.25 of the actual JCS, respectively.  The third prediction equation developed utilizing L*, a*, and b* was: JCS = 12.920 – (0.219 x L*) + (0.07342 x a*) – (0.02166 x b*); r[superscript]2 = 0.906.  For test population, 97.80 and 68.22% of the observations were predicted within [plus or minus]0.50 and 0.25 of the actual JCS, respectively.  All prediction equations predicted 92% or more of the JCS observations within [plus or minus]0.50 and would be useful when sorting pork carcasses for export to valuable Asian markets.  The second and third prediction equations would be advantageous as they require fewer measurements and could be more rapidly collected.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During germination, biochemical changes occur in the wheat kernel by stimulation of enzymes and hormones, and the seed reserves are mobilized. Infrared microspectroscopy and imaging enables a localized chemical inventory, upon germination, to study the process. Frozen sections of germinated wheat mounted onto BaF[subscript]2 were mapped to produce functional group images for comparison with corresponding sections of ungerminated kernels. Relative functional group populations in the scutellum and embryonic axis were assessed before and after germination. An average 23% reduction in lipid to protein ratio was observed in the scutellum based on the comparison of 53,733 spectra. As a result of the early germination process, lipid in the scutellum was depleted to provide energy for the growing embryo. &#xd;
Germination of the kernels while in the field before harvest due to high humidity is known as preharvest sprouting. Preharvest sprouting has detrimental effects on the end use quality of the wheat (sprout damage) and cause economic loses. Tolerance to preharvest sprouting is highly desirable. To assist breeding program, a nondestructive near-IR chemical imaging method has been developed to test new lines for resistance to preharvest sprouting. The higher sensitivity of subsurface chemical imaging, compared with visual detection, alpha amylase determination, or viscosity testing, permits germination detection at early stages. A near-IR chemical imaging system with an InGaAs focal plane array (FPA) detector in the 1100 nm-1700 nm range was used. Kernels from six different cultivars, including HRW and HWW wheat, were exposed to moist conditions for  6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours. Images of each 90 kernel group were examined; kernels exposed to moisture for 36 hours were compared with kernels treated for 3 hours as a control. Each kernel was classified as sprouted or not sprouted with the criteria of log 1/R intensity at select wavelengths or select factors of principle component analysis (PCA) treatment of reflectance intensity data. Imaging wavelength range was expanded beyond 1700 nm to 2400 nm with the use of InSb FPA.  Study for the potential for unsupervised determination in nondestructive near-IR imaging with detection wavelengths 1200-2400 is ongoing. Some preliminary results presented are encouraging.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We are interested in modular static analysis to analyze softwares automatically. We&#xd;
focus on programs with data structures, and in particular, programs with pointers. The&#xd;
final goal is to find errors in a program (problems of dereferencing, aliasing, etc) or to prove&#xd;
that a program is correct (regarding those problems) in an automatic way.&#xd;
Isthiaq, Pym, O'Hearn and Reynolds have recently developed separation logics, which&#xd;
are Hoare logics with assertions and predicates language that allow to prove the correctness&#xd;
of programs that manipulate pointers. The semantics of the logic's triples ({P}C{P'}) is&#xd;
defined by predicate transformers in the style of weakest preconditions.&#xd;
We expressed and proved the correctness of those weakest preconditions (wlp) and&#xd;
strongest postconditions (sp), in particular in the case of while-loops. The advance from&#xd;
the existing work is that wlp and sp are defined for any formula, while previously existing&#xd;
rules had syntactic restrictions.&#xd;
We added fixpoints to the logic as well as a postponed substitution which then allow to&#xd;
express recursive formula. We expressed wlp and sp in the extended logic and proved their&#xd;
correctness. The postponed substitution is directly useful to express recursive formula. For&#xd;
example, [equations removed, still appears in abstract]&#xd;
describes the set of memory where x points to a list of integers.&#xd;
Next, the goal was to use separation logic with fixpoints as an interface language for&#xd;
pointer analysis. That is, translating the domains of those analyses into formula of the&#xd;
logic (and conversely) and to prove their correctness. One might also use the translations&#xd;
to prove the correctness of the pointer analysis itself.&#xd;
We illustrate this approach with a simple pointers-partitioning analysis. We translate&#xd;
the logic formula into an abstract language we designed which allows us to describe the&#xd;
type of values registered in the memory (nil, integer, booleans, pointers to pairs of some&#xd;
types, etc.) as well as the aliasing and non-aliasing relations between variables and locations in the memory. The main contribution is the definition of the abstract language and&#xd;
its semantics in a concrete domain which is the same as the one for the semantics of formula. In particular, the semantics of the auxiliary variables, which is usually a question&#xd;
of implementation, is explicit in our language and its semantics. The abstract language is&#xd;
a partially reduced product of several subdomains and can be parametrised with existing&#xd;
numerical domains. We created a subdomain which is a tabular data structure to cope with&#xd;
the imprecision from not having sets of graphs. We expressed and proved the translations&#xd;
of formula into this abstract language.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With acceptance and utilization of chemical pesticides declining, some vegetable producers are turning to alternative methods to manage plant health issues.  Compost tea (CT) has provided control of some foliar pathogens and may provide benefits beyond disease suppression.  Despite an increasing body of popular and scientific literature focusing on CT as a biological control option for growers, information on the efficacy of CT is still lacking for many pathosystems.  In this study, field trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of CT on Septoria lycopersici, causal agent of Septoria leaf spot on tomato, in Kansas, in 2006 and 2007.  Previous research done at KSU with a similar CT showed adequate control of this pathogen in field and greenhouse studies conducted.  Additional work to develop a rapid screening method for efficacy of CT formulations was carried out in the greenhouse at Manhattan, KS.&#xd;
CT sprayed weekly on tomato plants prior to and after disease onset led to no significant difference in control of the pathogen compared to untreated controls.  A contact fungicide (chlorothalonil) provided significant control of the pathogen in 2007, but not in 2006.   These results contrast with those obtained in previous K-State research.  It is difficult to assess why such striking differences were obtained, but the variation in these results point to the need to identify optimal recipes of CT for this pathosystem.&#xd;
Preliminary investigations standardized plant age, inoculum concentration, incubation conditions, and incubation interval for measurable Septoria leaf spot disease development on young tomato plants in the greenhouse.  Ingredients of the field-tested CT were used to make a variety of CTs to test using the greenhouse-screening assay.  Further work on identifying effective CT recipes is needed to substantiate the validity of this screening protocol and to evaluate the correlation of this method with disease suppression in the field.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis is the tool for moving companies to the next level in safety.  I believe through this plan we can keep people safe in the agribusiness industry.  This is very important, so that we can keep cost down and be able to stay in business; or avoid costly litigation / arbitration hearings because someone was injured on the job.&#xd;
	When I was hired my job was to develop procedures that meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, reduced injuries, and would be a continuous improvement type of program.  &#xd;
	The thesis will be introductory information in regards to safety followed by a sample safety manual that I have created by working with different safety professional in the safety industry.</dc:description>

They have certain skills and abilities along with industry experience that provides them with certain advantages that would allow them to succeed in the industry.  The thesis or study will provide them with a detailed study of the possibilities and the challenges that are before them.&#xd;
To gain insight into positioning a firm in the industry, one must find a tool to help us to discover the answers to the question.  I will use &#xd;
"Strategic Visioning in Cascade", this model outlines area of interest such as; a strategic overview, a value proposition, a market analysis, a functional analysis, financial projection and exit strategy in its total.  The focus of the study will provide insight into the value proposition and market analysis.&#xd;
The value proposition will follow Michael Porter's Competitive Strategy analogy of cost leadership, differentiation and focus strategies.  The market analysis will follow Thompson and Strickland's seven questions that lead to understanding of the selected industry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The cosmetic industry is growing rapidly, and one popular category is lip products.  Women consider lip products a necessity and many would not leave home without it.  Though the bigger cosmetic companies may have internal cosmetic lexicons, they are not available in the public domain.  The purpose of this study was to develop a lexicon for descriptive sensory testing of lip products. Lip balms, lip glosses, and lipsticks were tested in this study. In part 1 (EXPERIMENT 1), two focus groups were conducted to understand women's perceptions of lip products, and also to elicit desirable and undesirable characteristics in the products.  The women's idea of a perfect lip product was:  clear/sheer/neutral color, smooth, not sticky, moisturizing and flavorless/tasteless.  In part 2 (EXPERIMENT 2), a lexicon was developed for the lip products. Attributes were categorized under "Initial Texture", "Initial Appearance", "After Appearance" and "After Texture."  In part 3 (EXPERIMENT 3) of the study, the lexicon was validated by testing various lip products using lexicon developed in part 2. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results by product type indicated that the lexicon was able to differentiate among the lipsticks, lip balms and lip glosses.  The lexicon was further able to show similarities and differences within a product type. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis, which are both multivariate techniques, validated the inferences from the univariate analysis (ANOVA).  The two panelist groups (three panelists from the lexicon development panel – group 1, and three new panelists – group 2) showed no differences (P > 0.05) in attribute evaluations for all the samples tested. The lexicon developed in this study could be used to identify similarities and differences in other lip products such as lip plumper, lip liners and multi-use products.  The authors hope that this research is extrapolated to other aspects of the personal care industry, such as hair care and skin care, and can aid in product development, product optimization, and claim substantiation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cluster based lack of fit tests for linear regression models are generally effective in detecting model inadequacy due to between- or within-cluster lack of fit. Typically, lack of fit exists as a combination of these two pure types, and can be extremely difficult to detect depending on the nature of the mixture. Su and Yang (2006) and Miller and Neill (2007) have proposed lack of fit tests which address this problem. Based on a simulation comparison of the two testing procedures, it is concluded that the Su and Yang test can be expected to be effective when the true model is locally well approximated within each specified cluster and the lack of fit is not due to an unspecified predictor variable. The Miller and Neill test accommodates a broader alternative, which can thus result in comparatively lower but effective power. However, the latter test demonstrated the ability to detect model inadequacy when the lack of fit was a function of an unspecified predictor variable and does not require a specified clustering for implementation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Researchers have yet to examine how trait sensation seeking and state positive affect combine to influence participation in risky behaviors. This study examined how participant levels of sensation seeking and positive affect interacted to influence participant interest in performing a risky behavior. It was hypothesized that an interaction between sensation seeking and positive affect would be found, such that high sensation seekers low in positive affect would show more interest in participating in a risky activity than high sensation seekers that were high in positive affect or all participants low in sensation seeking, regardless of positive affect. Trait sensation seeking was measured in an initial group of participants (N = 693), using a subscale of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (Zuckerman Kuhlman, Joireman, Teta, &amp; Kraft, 1993). Using these scores, high and low sensation seekers (N = 99) were invited to a second study, where videos were used to manipulate levels of state positive affect (Hemenover, 2003). Participants were then given a questionnaire to measure interest in participating in a risky drug study. No interaction was found, but a main effect for sensation seeking (Zuckerman, 1971) was discovered, such that high sensation seekers reported more interest in participating in a risky behavior than low sensation seekers. Therefore, it appears that participant interest in risky behaviors was a function of levels of trait sensation seeking. It is possible that problems with data collection or the risk-taking scenario contributed to the inability to support the hypothesis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk is marketed as a convenience product in the United States (U.S.) and as the most common form of milk in many other parts of the world. Two studies were conducted to get a better understanding of sensory properties and consumer acceptability in UHT milk. &#xd;
First study compared the differences in flavor and texture of commercial UHT milk from different countries (France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Peru, Thailand, and the U.S.). A total of 37 UHT and sterilized milk samples including whole, 2% reduced-fat, and low-fat milk were evaluated. Five highly trained panelists used flavor and texture profiling to describe the sensory properties of each milk sample. Higher levels of processed, chalky, brown, and cooked flavor notes generally corresponded to lower levels of fresh dairy flavor characteristics. In general, samples did not vary consistently within a country. Interestingly, fat content did not correlate with dairy fat flavor or with viscosity. This research suggests that companies' manufacturing processes may have more impact than country or fat content in determining quality of UHT milk. &#xd;
Second study compared UHT milk acceptability by U.S. milk consumers unused to UHT milk and Thai consumers who typically drank UHT milk.  Preference mapping technique was used to study sensory characteristics of UHT milk that drive overall liking from each of those consumer groups. Consumer studies were conducted in Bangkok, Thailand and in Manhattan, Kansas with one hundred consumers participating in each location. Both groups of consumers evaluated five commercial UHT whole milks that represented a range of UHT milk properties. U.S. consumers thought that the UHT milks had more off-flavor and liked them overall less than did Thai consumers. Results from the external preference map showed that both groups of consumers liked UHT milk with more dairy characteristics and higher fat feel. However, there was a separate group of Thai consumers who liked UHT milk with processed, cooked, and brown flavors. Lack of freshness, butyric acid, and sour aromatics were undesirable sensory attributes in UHT milk, regardless of consumer population. Off-flavors in the UHT milks in this study may be described with those attributes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a new way of approaching the design,&#xd;
construction, and management of a building. It is an innovative method that bridges the&#xd;
communication gap between the architects, engineers, and contractors. By definition Building&#xd;
Information Modeling is a model-based technology linked with a database of project&#xd;
information. BIM builds a virtual model of the building so that architects, engineers, and&#xd;
contractors can all access at anytime. With BIM, architects and engineers are able to efficiently&#xd;
generate and exchange information, create digital representations of all stages of the building&#xd;
process, and simulate real-world performance. By doing this, many errors are eliminated in the&#xd;
field which increases productivity and improves quality. This report defines what BIM actually&#xd;
is and discusses the benefits and challenges that are associated with this new method of design&#xd;
and construction. Specifically, this report will take an in depth look at how BIM affects MEP&#xd;
design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Seat belt usage is considered to be one of the most effective ways of improving safety of motor vehicle occupants. Thus, increasing seat belt usage among motorists has become one of the top prioritized goals of many highway safety improvement programs. The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to estimate potential economic benefits associated with increased seat belt usage by Kansas motorists based on conditions prevailing in the State of Kansas. Seat belt effectiveness in reducing injuries was estimated and those values were then used to estimate economic benefits due to injury reductions. Five methodologies were used to estimate seat belt effectiveness which included multiple logistic regression, double pair comparison method, Cox proportional hazards regression, conditional logistic regression, and risk ratio model using estimating equation approach. Crash data from Kansas Accident Reporting System (KARS) database was used. A procedure was developed to estimate economic benefits due to increased seat belt usage based on State conditions.  &#xd;
The highest variation in estimated seat belt effectiveness values using different methods were observed for incapacitating injuries while the lowest variation was observed for possible injuries. For fatal injuries, the estimated seat belt effectiveness values ranged from 50-69% for passenger cars and 57-70% for other passenger vehicles. The range of seat belt effectiveness values for incapacitating injuries was 47-65% for passenger cars and 44-69% for other passenger vehicles. It was also found that the multiple logistic regression method provide relatively narrower confidence intervals for almost all the nonfatal injury categories in both vehicle groups. Based on estimations using logistic regression method, seat belts are 56% effective in preventing fatal injuries in passenger cars and 61% effective in other passenger vehicles. The seat belt effectiveness in reducing incapacitating injuries was found to be 53% in passenger cars and 52% in other passenger vehicles. &#xd;
It was found that if seat belt usage rate in Kansas reaches the national average rate of 81% (2006), the resulted annual economic benefits to the State is estimated to be about $ 191 millions in 2006 dollars or in other words, due to lower seat belt usage currently observed in Kansas compared to national usage level, the annual estimated economic loss is about $ 191 millions. &#xd;
Seat belt effectiveness values are currently not available based on KABCO (K-Fatal, A-Incapacitating, B-Non-incapacitating, C-Possible, and O-No injuries) injury scale. Therefore, this study could serve as an initiative towards establishing a procedure to estimate benefits of seat belt usage based on State highway crash data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The primary objective of this research project was to evaluate the shear behavior of three asphalt-to-asphalt mix interfaces.  To accomplish this objective, a special attachment and loading mechanism was designed and built to facilitate the measurement of the dynamic shear reaction modulus and shear strength of the asphalt-to-asphalt interfaces when shear and normal forces are acting simultaneously and they are proportional.  Two tests were conducted on 4-inch diameter cylindrical samples cored from an asphalt concrete pad where three types of asphalt-to- asphalt interfaces were built. For each interface, four tack-coat quantities were sprayed. On each sample, the Dynamic Shear Reaction Modulus test was conducted first. Then the Shear Strength test was conducted until the sample failed in shear at the interface.  The experiments suggest that the shear strength of the interface is affected neither by the interface type nor by the tack-coat application rate.  However, the dynamic shear reaction modulus was affected by both interface type and by the tack-coat application rate. The lowest moduli were recorded for the interface between two fine graded asphalt mixes. With very few exceptions, the highest moduli were obtained for the tack-coat application rate recommended by the construction specification.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Compounds containing the tetrazole scaffold have wide variety of applications in medicine, food industry, automobile industry, photography, agriculture. As a result, the structure and reactivity of these compounds have been studied. However, the related tetrazolethione scaffold has not been studied well. In our work presented in Chapter-1 (part-1), the synthesis, photochemical properties and reactivities of 1,4-disubstituted tetrazolethione analogs 20a-d are described.  The solvent effects on the photochemistry of compounds are discussed and; the rates and quantum yields for the photodecomposition of compounds are documented. The photodecomposition products for the photolysis of 20a-d were analyzed by LCMS, GCMS and NMR spectroscopy; the results pertaining to their identification are also reported. Further, the multiphoton excitation of THF solution of 1-methyl-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-1H-tetrazol-5(4H)-thione 20d with Ti: Sapphire laser was also performed; however, the experiment was not successful. In Chapter-2 (part-1), the cytoxicity of the 1-methyl-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-tetrazol-5(4H)-thione 20c against human breast cancer cell is documented. MTT assays were performed for a time dependent study of the cytoxicity. &#xd;
&#xd;
	In part-2 which consists of Chapter-3, the synthesis of 2-(2-phenylimino)vinyl)benzonitirle is described. This was as a step towards our laboratory's goal of synthesizing a series of mono-, di- and tri- azaenyne-allenes and studying their Myers-Saito and Schmittel cyclizations. In future, if our cyclization studies are successful, these cyclizations could be employed for synthesis of heteroaromatic rings found in many compounds of biological importance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ecological clines often result in gradients of disease pressure in natural plant communities, imposing a gradient of selection on disease resistance genes. We describe the diversity of a resistance gene homolog in natural populations of the dominant tallgrass prairie grass, Andropogon gerardii, across a precipitation gradient ranging from 47.63 cm/year in western Kansas to 104.7 cm/year in central Missouri. Since moisture facilitates infection by foliar bacterial pathogens, plants along this precipitation gradient will tend to experience heavier bacterial disease pressure to the east.  In maize, the gene Rxo1 confers resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia andropogonis. Rxo1 homologs have been identified in A. gerardii and B. andropogonis is known to infect natural populations of A. gerardii. The spatial genetic structure of A. gerardii was assessed from central Missouri to western Kansas by genotyping with AFLP markers. Samples were also genotyped for Rxo1 homologs by amplifying an 810 base pair region of the leucine-rich repeat and digesting with restriction enzymes. We compared Rxo1 homolog diversity to AFLP diversity across different spatial scales. Genetic dissimilarity based on AFLP markers was lower than would have occurred by chance at distances up to 30 m, and different prairies were more dissimilar than would have occurred by chance, but there was not a longitudinal trend in within-prairie dissimilarity as measured by AFLP markers. Dissimilarity of the Rxo1 homologs was higher in the east suggesting the presence of diversifying selection in the more disease-conducive eastern environments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gender is a constructing concept around which the traditionally structured marriage was formed. An undercurrent of traditional thought still influences how women make their decisions around pursuing a career and caring for their children. Their relationships with their husbands, in part influences both their decision-making and experience of their roles. This was a qualitative multiple care study describing women's decision-making around and their experiences of these roles. Themes found in the participant's narratives related to finances, intentional decision-making, and the fluidity of child-care and work roles. Final reflections during the child launching phase of life showed that role congruency was important for the participants and that they were currently satisfied with their situations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The core objective of this research is to develop an estimator capable of tracking the states of ground targets with observation measurements obtained from a single monocular camera mounted on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  Typical sensors on a small UAV include an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with three axes accelerometer and rate gyro sensors and a global positioning system (GPS) receiver which gives position and velocity estimates of the UAV.  Camera images are combined with these measurements in state estimate filters to track ground features of opportunity and a target.  The images are processed by a keypoint detection and matching algorithm that returns pixel coordinates for the features.  Kinematic state equations are derived that reflect the relationships between the available input and output measurements and the states of the UAV, features, and target.  These equations are used in the development of coupled state estimators for the dynamic state of the UAV, for estimation of feature positions, and for estimation of target position and velocity.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The estimator developed is tested in MATLAB/SIMULINK, where GPS and IMU data are generated from the simulated states of a nonlinear model of a Navion aircraft.  Images are also simulated based upon a fabricated environment consisting of features and a moving ground target.  Target observability limitations are overcome by constraining the target vehicle to follow ground terrain, defined by local features, and subsequent modification of the target's observation model.  An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) provides the simultaneous localization and mapping solution for the estimation of aircraft states and feature locations.  Another filter, a loosely coupled Kalman filter for the target states, receives 3D measurements of target position with estimated covariance obtained by an unscented transformation (UT).  The UT uses the mean and covariance from the camera measurements and from the UKF estimated aircraft states and feature locations to determine the estimated target mean and covariance.  Simulation results confirm that the new loosely coupled filters are capable of estimating target states.  Experimental data, collected from a research UAV, explores the effectiveness of the terrain estimation techniques required for target tracking.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There is a high need to repair or replace many bridges in the state of Kansas.  23% of the bridges in Kansas are labeled structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.  A majority of these bridges serve rural areas and are damaged due to overloading during harvest season.   A state-of-the-art method of performing structural health monitoring on these bridges followed by an effective method of strengthening and repair was researched and presented in this thesis.&#xd;
The first phase of this research involved researching multiple devices to be used for state-of-the-art health monitoring.  After deciding on an appropriate system, multiple tests were performed to determine the systems performance compared against conventional systems.  The system was tested on a laboratory scale pre-stressed concrete T-beam.  The system was tested on its ability to effectively record and transmit acceleration data.  If this system were to be implemented on an actual bridge, KDOT could make a decision to repair or strengthen the bridge based on the results.  The next phase of the research was to determine an effective strengthening procedure using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP).&#xd;
Reinforced concrete beam specimens were cast and tested in the lab.  The specimens consisted of rectangular and T-shaped cross-sections to create different failure modes when tested in bending.   The primary issue when strengthening with CFRP is the issue of early separation failure when using CFRP in the longitudinal direction only.  In an effort to prove this, the specimens were strengthened with five layers of CFRP and tested in four-point bending until failure.  In an effort to prevent early separation failure, CFRP “U-wraps” were applied to provide shear resistance and additional anchorage for the flexural CFRP.  The beams were then tested in flexure until failure by FRP rupture or concrete crushing followed by FRP rupture.  The test results indicate that the U-wraps allowed the FRP to reach full capacity and fail in FRP rupture.  The use of CFRP provided a strength increase of about 220% over the control beam specimens while significantly reducing the ultimate deflection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Since its discovery in the 1940's, barium titanate has become one of the more popular dielectric materials for use in discrete capacitors due to its high relative permittivity.  Recently, consumer electronics have decreased in size, driving the need for smaller electronic components.  To fill this need, researchers have created polycrystalline barium titanate with individual grains in the nanometer scale.  With this decrease in size, many problems arise.  This paper will outline the effects on the dielectric properties due to shrinking the individual grains, as well as discuss techniques for dielectric measurement of this material.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This work explores the emergence and evolution of the rhetoric choice rhetoric as it pertains to contemporary American abortion politics. &lt;Choice> is explored from an ideographic perspective, borrowing from the theoretical framework for ideographic rhetorical criticism established by Michael Calvin McGee. The analysis begins with a diachronic analysis of the emergence of the ideograph of &lt;choice> within the law with an investigation of the written decisions in four Supreme Court cases central to the construction of the right to choose: Roe v. Wade (1973), Maher v. Roe (1977), Harris v. McRae (1980), and Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989). This investigation reveals a synchronic relationship between &lt;choice> and another higher order ideograph, &lt;liberty>. The criticism continues with an investigation of the usage of &lt;choice> by pro-choice advocates in two documents published by NARAL Pro-Choice America, Choices: Women Speak About Abortion is a collection of women's narratives about their experiences obtaining an abortion, and Breaking Barriers, a guide for the development and implementation of proactive policy campaigns for pro-choice advocates. McGee's method is employed to investigate the ideographic usage of &lt;choice> within these documents, revealing the ideographic abstraction that associates the alleged idea content of ideographs.  This ideographic analysis reveals the inability of &lt;choice> to live up to its alleged idea content as a result of the limitations inherent in the grounding of &lt;choice> within the higher order ideograph of &lt;liberty> and the impact of these limitations on particular populations, mainly indigent women in the United States.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Online professional development has the potential to be a dynamic tool to construct knowledge and enhance professional performance. Online collaboration tools have accelerated learning and have made online professional development convenient, dynamic, and flexible. Yet access to powerful learning resources has not always ensured that quality online professional development has taken place or that authentic, transformational learning has occurred. This study has shown that technology has presented challenges that have proved difficult for online professional development facilitators and participants. Consequently, the facilitator's role in professional development has been even more critical in the virtual environment and the facilitator has had to be even more intentional in their actions, decisions, and expectations. &#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of the study was to research, develop, and validate an online professional development facilitator's handbook that would clarify and demonstrate the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and skills utilized by exemplary online professional development facilitators. This study has also ascertained practical instructional strategies that are effective in planning, implementing, and facilitating online professional development.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result of this study, an online professional development handbook was developed according to Borg and Gall's (1989) Research and Development (R&amp;D) cycle and methodology using three panels that consisted of expert and novice online professional development facilitators. &#xd;
&#xd;
Findings include: Learning, defined as the process of constructing personal understanding through interactions with others while collectively engaging in challenges that are novel and transferable to other situations and settings, is transformational and has a sustaining impact when skillfully facilitated in the online environment. Online learning communities organized around collaborative inquiry and collective problem solving become co-creators of knowledge in a risk-free, trusting environment. Participants (teachers) become self-determining learners focused on engaging in appropriate endeavors to increase their classroom content knowledge and management skills by identifying their own needs and creating a plan to raise academic achievement and improve their own practices. When educational systems invest in honest dialogue about student work, candidly assess student and teacher needs, make changes based on data and research, and value individual and group contributions, these organizations become cultures of thinkers and communities of learners.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was conducted to define and compare typical sensory characteristics of high quality Italian gelati to ice creams produced in the United States.  Highly trained descriptive sensory panelists evaluated gelato samples in Italy, purchased direct from local gelaterias, and ice cream samples in the U.S., purchased from grocery stores and local shops.  In general, gelati gave higher overall fruity and fruit ID scores, chocolate gelati gave higher chocolate and cocoa notes, and vanilla gelati gave higher vanilla and lower vanillin intensities than most U.S. ice creams.  Gelati were consistently associated with higher density, lower firmness, and slower meltdown. When compared to U.S. ice creams, Italian gelati were characterized by specific sensory properties: "true to type" flavors; high intensity flavors that were considered to be typical to that flavor category or specific fruit and are combined with a dense, smooth texture that allows for the development of flavor, body and bloom, enhancing the perception of flavors.  The research conducted in this study may be useful for ice cream manufacturers and sensory scientists. This study is the first to define sensory characteristics of high quality Italian gelati and the information may be used to produce ice cream with increased consumer liking.  The descriptive attributes developed can be used for the development of new or improved of ice cream products.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Body weight control via increasing exercise and/or decreasing calorie intake has been&#xd;
linked to a reduced cancer risk in animal models. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. This study assessed the impact of exercise with or without limited dietary calorie intake on the overview profiling of phospholipids and gene expression in the skin tissues of weight&#xd;
controlled-mice.&#xd;
Mice were randomly assigned to three groups: ad libitum-fed sedentary control, ad&#xd;
libitum-fed treadmill exercise at 13.4 m/min for 60 min/d, 5 d/wk (Ex+AL), and exercise but pair-fed with the sedentary control (Ex+PF). After 10 wks, Ex+PF but not Ex+AL mice demonstrated a significant decrease in both body weight and percentage of body fat when compared to the sedentary controls.&#xd;
Among 338 phospholipids measured in the skin samples by electrospray ionization mass&#xd;
spectrometry, most classes of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylcholine-containing lipids&#xd;
with ether linkage (ePC), and some lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) significantly decreased in Ex+PF mice when compared to the controls. Furthermore, some species of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) containing omega-3 18:0-22:6 fatty acyl combinations&#xd;
increased significantly in Ex+PF mice. A total of 25 significantly-changed phospholipids were distinguishable between diet and exercise treatments by discriminant analysis. The reduced PI in&#xd;
Ex+PF mice was observed concomitantly with a significant reduction of PI3K protein&#xd;
expression.&#xd;
Among the 45,101 probe sets tested in skin tissues, expression of 839 genes was&#xd;
significantly changed by exercise with or without limited dietary calorie intake. The genes with impacted expression were involved in oxidative stress, inflammatory response, lipolysis, protein synthesis, and signaling pathway. Up-regulated expression of genes involved in elongation of long chain fatty acids in Ex+PF but not Ex+AL mice appears to partially account for increased level of 18:0-22:5PC/PE and 18:0-22:6 PC/PE.&#xd;
Taken together, these data indicate that controlling body weight via exercise with limited dietary calorie intake rather than exercise alone significantly modified phospholipid and gene expression profiles. The altered profiles may be associated with cancer preventive mechanisms; in particular, reduced PI and PI-related PI3K expression and altered expression of genes involved in protein kinase activity and lipid metabolism may prevent cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effect of enzyme in temper water on wheat milling performance and flour quality was studied.  Five independent variables, enzyme concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature, tempered wheat moisture content, and tempering water pH, were studied.  An enzyme cocktail consisting of cellulase, xylanase, and pectinase was used at 5 different concentrations.  A single pure variety of hard red winter wheat was tempered under defined conditions following an RSM central composite design which required 33 tests including 7 replicates.  Each treatment had 5 levels: high, medium high, medium, medium low, and low.  After tempering, the physical characteristics of the wheat kernel were determined by using the Single Kernel Characterization System.  An experimental laboratory mill (Ross Mill) was used to mill wheat into flour.  Thirteen streams of flour, and additional streams of bran, shorts, red dog, and germ were obtained. Product yield, protein, ash, and flour color were evaluated.  The data were analyzed and compared using the software SAS and RSM Plus. &#xd;
The data showed that incubation time was the only significant factor affecting the tempered wheat hardness (p&lt;0.05).  The treatments affected the flour yield from the break rolls more than that from the reduction rolls.  However, a maximum point for flour yield was not found.  The relationship between treatments and flour yield was established with a prediction model equation.  Also, the enzyme effect on the dough properties and bread making were investigated.  The treatments did not affect the optimum water absorption for the flours. However, enzyme treated flours showed shorter mixing times.  Regardless of the differences in mixing times, the specific loaf volumes were not significantly different for the all treatments.  Bread baked from the flour milled from enzyme treated wheat did not show a positive effect on bread staling.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two experiments evaluated effects of glycerol on pellet mill production and pig performance.  In Exp. 1, increasing glycerol increased (quadratic; P &lt; 0.01) pellet durability index through 9% added glycerol.   Adding glycerol decreased (linear; P > 0.01) production energy (kWh/t). In Exp. 2, pigs were fed one of seven diets with no added soy oil or glycerol (control); the control diet with 3 or 6% added soy oil, 3 or 6% added glycerol, and 6 or 12% additions of a 50:50 soy oil/glycerol blend in a 26-d growth assay. Adding glycerol improved (P &lt; 0.01) pellet durability compared to soy oil and the soy oil/glycerol blend treatments.  Pigs fed glycerol had increased (linear, P &lt; 0.03) ADG. Adding soy oil, glycerol, or the soy oil/glycerol blend resulted in similar final BW. Two experiments evaluated the effects of glycerol as a replacement for lactose on pellet mill production and nursery pig performance.  In Exp. 1, pigs were fed one of ten treatments that included 0, 3.6, or 7.2% lactose or 0, 3.6, or 7.2 % glycerol and fed in either meal or pelleted form. Pellet durability index increased (linear; P &lt; 0.01) with added lactose and glycerol. Glycerol decreased (linear; P &lt; 0.01) production energy (kWh/t). There was a tendency (P &lt; 0.06) for an inclusion level × diet form (meal or pellet) interaction observed for ADG.  Pigs fed the pelleted diets containing the 7.2% glycerol inclusion had decreased ADG compared to all other treatments.  In Exp. 2, pigs were fed one of fourteen diets that included 0, 3.6, 7.2, or 10.8% lactose or 0, 3.6, 7.2, or 10.8 % glycerol and fed in either meal or pelleted form. There was no effect (P &lt; 0.27) of diet form, inclusion level, or source on ADG or ADFI. Eight experiments evaluated the effect of ingredients on the flow ability of ground corn. Flow ability of feed improved with added glycerol, especially when added to meal diets containing hammer mill ground corn. Specialty protein ingredients in powder form reduce flow ability, while fine lactose sources improved flow ability.  Granulated ingredients improved flow ability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The ferroelastic urea inclusion compound (UIC) of 2,10-undecanedione/urea exhibits a striking pseudoelastic memory effect.  Although pseudoelasticity is possible for UICs containing only 2,10-undecanedione, introduction of a structurally similar guest impurity (2-undecanone) gives rise to rubber-like behavior, a form of pseudoelasticity. This phenomenon depends on both the crystal strain and the concentration of monoketone: above 13-14% 2-undecanone, pseudoelastic behavior is observed reliably, even at strains as high as 2.4%.  The dramatic change in ferroelastic behavior over a small range of impurity content indicates that this is a critical threshold phenomenon.&#xd;
Because the impurity concentration has such a dramatic effect on domain switching, it was important to determine the sector-dependent patterns of incorporation of this relaxive impurity.  Preliminary HPLC analyses of guest populations suggest that preferential incorporation of monoketone guests occurs between nonequivalent growth sectors, and that these patterns can be rationalized using a symmetry specific growth model.  Birefringence mapping and HPLC studies of optically anomalous UICs containing mixtures of 2,9-decanedione and 2-decanone (which possess trigonal metric symmetry) suggest analogous patterns in guest incorporation and/or ordering that can also be rationalized.  Although crystals of 2,9-decanedione/urea exhibit no ferroelastic strain at ambient temperature, they exhibit a proper ferroelastic phase transition near -170[degrees]C.  &#xd;
It is proposed that differential perfection of domains gives rise to pseudoelasticity in UICs, and that relaxive impurities play an important role in the energetics of this process. Because ultrafast video studies of domain reversion kinetics demonstrate no clear correlation of observed rates with impurity content, it is proposed that the relaxive impurities facilitate spontaneous domain reversion by annealing stressed defect sites that would otherwise lead to irreversible or plastic domain switching. &#xd;
Following earlier work using synchrotron white beam X-ray topography, the driving force for domain reversion is thought to involve the presence of nanoscopic twins whose strain is epitaxially mismatched with neighboring daughter domains. The behavior of these nanoscopic twins was monitored with in-situ X-ray diffraction studies of stressed crystals, and this has led to a more thorough understanding of the role of these nanoscopic twins in the ferroelastic domain switching and rubber-like behavior in this class of materials.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We investigated the effect of shear on the structure and aggregation kinetics of unstable&#xd;
colloids using small angle light scattering. We used an aqueous suspension of 20 nm polystyrene&#xd;
latex microspheres and MgCl[subscript]2 to induce aggregation. The sample was only sheared once for&#xd;
approximately 33 sec at different times, typically 1 min, 5 min, or 15 min, after the onset of&#xd;
aggregation. The average shear rate was in the range of 0.13 - 3.56 sec[superscript]−1 , which was in a laminar&#xd;
regime. The unsheared sample gelled after ca. 45 min. When the sample was sheared soon after&#xd;
the onset of aggregation, the aggregation followed the diffusion limited cluster cluster&#xd;
aggregation (DLCA) kinetics to yield D[subscript f] = 1.80 [plus or minus] 0.04 aggregates unaffected by the shear. The&#xd;
gel time also remained the same as the unsheared gel. Shearing at later stages of aggregation&#xd;
shortened the gel time and enhanced the scattered light intensity significantly indicating rapid&#xd;
growth. Then, depending on the shear rate, there were three different behaviors. At high shear&#xd;
rates, the aggregate structure was inhomogeneous after the shear was stopped with a crossover in&#xd;
slope in the scattered light intensity versus q, to imply hybrid superaggregates with two different&#xd;
fractal dimensions. At intermediate shear rates far from the gel point, there was a similar&#xd;
crossover after the shear was stopped; however, the fractal dimension regained 1.80 [plus or minus] 0.04 at the&#xd;
gel point. At low shear rates, the aggregation rate was increased, but the aggregate structure was&#xd;
uniform, and the fractal dimension remained 1.75 [plus or minus] 0.05.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Logistic regression model is a branch of the generalized linear models and is&#xd;
widely used in many areas of scientific research. The logit link function and the binary&#xd;
dependent variable of interest make the logistic regression model distinct from linear&#xd;
regression model.&#xd;
The conclusion drawn from a fitted logistic regression model could be incorrect or&#xd;
misleading when the covariates can not explain and /or predict the response variable&#xd;
accurately based on the fitted model- that is, lack-of-fit is present in the fitted logistic&#xd;
regression model.&#xd;
The current goodness-of-fit tests can be roughly categorized into four types. (1)&#xd;
The tests are based on covariate patterns, e.g., Pearson's Chi-square test, Deviance D&#xd;
test, and Osius and Rojek's normal approximation test. (2) Hosmer-Lemeshow's C and&#xd;
Hosmer-Lemeshow's H tests are based on the estimated probabilities. (3) Score tests&#xd;
are based on the comparison of two models, where the assumed logistic regression&#xd;
model is embedded into a more general parametric family of models, e.g., Stukel's&#xd;
Score test and Tsiatis's test. (4) Smoothed residual tests include le Cessie and van&#xd;
Howelingen's test and Hosmer and Lemeshow's test. All of them have advantages and&#xd;
disadvantages.&#xd;
In this dissertation, we proposed a partition logistic regression model which can&#xd;
be viewed as a generalized logistic regression model, since it includes the logistic&#xd;
regression model as a special case. This partition model is used to construct goodness-of-&#xd;
fit test for a logistic regression model which can also identify the nature of lack-of-fit is&#xd;
due to the tail or middle part of the probabilities of success. Several simulation results&#xd;
showed that the proposed test performs as well as or better than many of the known&#xd;
tests.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explored the inclusion of creative drama into science teaching as an&#xd;
instructional strategy for enhancing elementary school students' understanding of scientific&#xd;
concepts. A treatment group of sixth grade students was taught a Full Option Science System&#xd;
(FOSS) science unit on Mixtures and Solutions with the addition of creative drama while a&#xd;
control group was taught using only the FOSS teaching protocol.&#xd;
Quantitative and qualitative data analyses demonstrated that students who studied science&#xd;
through creative drama exhibited a greater understanding of scientific content of the lessons and&#xd;
preferred learning science through creative drama. Treatment group students stated that they&#xd;
enjoyed participating in the activities with their friends and that the creative drama helped them&#xd;
to better understand abstract scientific concepts. Teachers involved with the creative drama&#xd;
activities were positively impressed and believed creative drama is a good tool for teaching&#xd;
science. Observations revealed that creative drama created a positive classroom environment,&#xd;
improved social interactions and self-esteem, that all students enjoyed creative drama, and that&#xd;
teachers' teaching style affected students' use of creative drama.&#xd;
The researcher concluded that the inclusion of creative drama with the FOSS unit&#xd;
enhanced students' scientific knowledge and understanding beyond that of the FOSS unit alone,&#xd;
that both teachers and students reacted positively to creative drama in science and that creative&#xd;
drama requires more time.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ozone, a triatomic form of oxygen with a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, is a strong antimicrobial and sanitizing agent with numerous potential applications in the food industry. One of them is the improvement of wheat flour baking qualities, by replacement of the actual chlorination treatment. Following recent developments realized by the company Goemar (France) which invented and patented an ozone treatment device for wheat grain and a method for making flour from ozone-treated grains, this study aims to determine the effect of ozone treatment on wheat grain and on wheat flour, and to compare them. Three different ozone concentrations with different application times rendering three quantities of absorbed ozone have been investigated. Rheological, physicochemical and baking properties of soft wheat flours stemming from both treatments were evaluated and compared to untreated flour. Results were overall significant and showed that the treatment of flour gives more marked results than the treatment on grain for retention capacity in sucrose and volume of cakes but decreases the [alpha]-amylase activity. On the other hand, action of ozone on grain augments the maximum viscosity of the flour. Bread volume was found to be increased by both treatments in similar proportions. The treatments were also analyzed in particular and showed specific characteristics. A single treatment has not been determined to enhance all characteristics of the flour. Hence, the modification of precise features of the flour has to be related to a specific treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Today's engineers of building lighting systems must maintain a careful balance between the demands of accepted standards of practice, the necessity of life safety, the system performance needs of the client, and the developing national energy standards and certifications gaining prominence in the public eye.  These sources of influence on the design process can create conflicts between the pressing need to conserve system energy usage and a costlier and perhaps unacceptable end-result for the client.  In this climate, various governmental organizations and industry cooperatives have been funding published research and case-studies in order to promote sustainable design practices.  Within these publications are repeated references to a "Task-Ambient" lighting fixture layout strategy.  Multiple recent publications cite profound energy-saving benefits attainable using this design method.  However, there is a noticeable lack of measured data concerning other qualities of this layout scheme, such as the end-user's comfort and ability to perform tasks under the resulting light distributions.  Whether this lack of data resulted from the added complexity associated with such non-numerical measurements, or for some other unknown reason, this report explores this gap in the available data.  An extended survey procedure was developed to approach the problem of measuring these unknown qualities of the Task-Ambient design strategy.  This involved constructing multiple physical lighting layout mockups, defining the features of the Task-Ambient strategy which necessitated measurement, and designing objective tasks tailored to measure each of these non-numerical qualities.  The careful analysis of this study's data results yields trends indicative of the Task-Ambient strategy, relative to a standard uniform layout, adversely affecting productivity, concentration, and the participants' subjective perceptions of the space's light distribution.  The lowered level of energy use was however affirmed.  The implications of these results are that the Task-Ambient strategy, while an efficient method of lighting system layout design, may not be beneficial for the client in other respects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Beef cattle feed lots produce significant, local point source pollution of the atmosphere. The dusts generated in the CAFOs are complex mixture of fine and ultra fine particles, organic compounds, transition metals, and adsorbed toxic gases. Since each component is toxic in itself, we do not fully understand the relative importance of each component in the dust and their interactions to inducing inflammatory changes in the lung. We did extensive literature searches to understand the mechanism of dust toxicity in respiratory system. This lead to focusing on solubility of dust in lung simulant fluid, and in-vitro study of release of two common biomarkers of inflammatory processes IL-6 and IL-8 from lung epithelial cells.&#xd;
Various concentrations (1 to 50%) of the dust extract induced release of IL-6, and IL-8 from lung epithelial cell as indicators of pro-inflammatory changes (IL-6), and amplification and maintenance of inflammation (IL-8). IL-6 release had dose dependence; peak production was seen with 25% dust extract. IL-8 production went down as the concentration of the dust extract increased from 1% to 25%. However, 50% dust extract was cytotoxic to the cell leading to 10-15% cell viability. At non-cytotoxic concentrations for lung epithelial cells, production of IL-8 was reduced. These findings suggested that higher exposure concentration were required to initiate inflammation as indicated by IL-6 release. Lower exposure concentrations (1 and 5% extracts) were related to optimal release of IL-8 needed to amplify and maintain the inflammatory response.&#xd;
Inhibition of endotoxin didn't significantly change the pattern of IL-6 or IL-8 release from epithelial cells. This finding suggested that at least a portion of the mechanism by which particle induced cytokine release from the lung epithelial cells was not endotoxin dependent. Heating samples at 1200C for 5 minutes modified some of the toxic properties of the dust extracts but didn't completely detoxify it. We observed that longer incubation period was required to peak release for both IL-6 and IL-8. However, the higher concentration of sample (50% extract) found to be cytotoxic in non-heat treated sample was no longer cytotoxic and induced both IL-6 and IL-8 release from the lung epithelial cells. This result suggested that heat&#xd;
treatment could reduce some of the dust extract's cytotoxic properties. However, the extract's potential to induce peak cytokine release increased.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A series of five trials were conducted to evaluate grain processing, distiller's grains inclusion in finishing diets, interactions between distiller's grains and dry-rolled corn (DRC) or steam-flaked corn (SFC), efficacy of removing roughage in the presence of distiller's grains and the digestibility of  distiller's grains in steam-flaked and dry-rolled corn diets.  The first trial was designed to determine the optimum flake density of SFC in beef finishing diets.  Diets consisted of corn flaked to densities of 360, 411, or 462 g/L.  Observed improvements in mill production would support increasing flake density; however numerical decreases in animal performance offset economic benefits of increased productivity.  The second trial was conducted to evaluate optimum levels of sorghum wet distiller's grains in finishing diets.  Crossbred yearling steers were fed diets containing DRC or SFC and levels of distiller's grains were 0, 10, 20, or 30% of diet dry matter.  Distiller's grains can effectively replaced a portion of the corn in finishing diets, but their nutritional value was greater in DRC diets than in SFC diets.  In trial 3, crossbred heifers were fed diets containing SFC with 0% DDG and 15% corn silage (CS), 25% DDG and 15% CS, or 25% DDG and 5% CS.  In trial 4, crossbreed heifers were fed diets similar containing DRC or SFC with 0% DDG and 15% CS, 25% DDG and 15% CS, or 25% DDG and 5% CS.  Results indicate that roughage levels can be reduced in feedlot diets containing DDG with no adverse effects on performance or carcass quality.  The fifth trial was a metabolism study conducted to evaluate the digestibility of DDG in beef cattle.  Treatments consisted of DRC with 0% DDG, DRC with 25% DDG, SFC with 0% DDG, and SFC with 25% DDG.  There were no significant grain processing by distiller's grain interactions observed in main effects.  In conclusion optimum flake density was 360 g/L, feeding distiller's grains has a greater value in DRC diets vs. SFC diets, roughage level and type are important in formulating finishing diets, roughage can be reduced when feeding distiller's grains, and ruminal ammonia, and pH are decreased and ruminal lactate is increased when feeding DDG and SFC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stream networks provide complex habitats for fish assemblages that can vary gradually along a gradient of stream size or abruptly at transition zones between large rivers and their tributaries.  We evaluated the relative importance of these gradual and abrupt habitat transitions in regulating stream fish assemblages by quantifying roles of stream size and spatial position within a drainage network as a determinant of fish assemblage structure within the Kansas River basin, KS.  We predicted fish assemblage structure to generally be dependent on stream size and that smaller streams would be influenced by their connectance to larger mainstem rivers.  Fishes in the Kansas River basin varied along a gradient of stream size and longitude, and after controlling for these effects, there was evidence that connectivity to a larger river influenced species richness and assemblage structure.  In 1st order streams there was an increase in species richness with increasing distance from a mainstem confluence and species composition in larger tributaries (i.e., 4th order streams) varied with proximity to the mainstem river.  We also found an increase in species richness at sites located on smaller tributaries connected to a larger downstream mainstem.  Species composition in 1st and 4th order streams also varied with connectance to the mainstem river.  Within three intensively sampled tributaries, there was an abrupt change in fish fauna between the Kansas River and sample sites above the confluence, but only gradual change in assemblage structure within each tributary with a high degree of seasonal variation.  In the first 20 stream km of these three mainstem tributaries adult fishes were more structured along a gradient away from the mainstem river than juveniles, potentially suggesting more generalized habitat needs of juvenile fishes.  At the spatial and temporal scale of our analysis, it appeared the effects of large rivers on tributary streams were generally localized.  However, the documented influence of spatial position suggests movements between habitats could regulate community level dynamics as well as individual species over longer temporal scales.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Process migration is a technique in clustering and distributed computing by which parallel applications can be dynamically moved between nodes in a cluster in response to differing phases of execution, which is of growing usefulness in the field of distributed computing.&#xd;
 &#xd;
A drawback to many recent implementations of process migration is that sockets for interprocess communication do not migrate with the process requiring communication to be rerouted through the process' starting, or home, node, resulting in reduced communications performance when the process is migrated away from its home node.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis focuses on the implemention a solution to this problem at the kernel level &#xd;
for the OpenMosix process migration system with efficient socket handoff and cluster-wide unique addressing by reimplemting TCP on top of the existing network code in the Linux kernel.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although falling short of the initial goal of fully transparent operation, this thesis presents a working implementation of migratable sockets for the OpenMosix process migration system that demonstrates working socket migration and improved performance over non-migrating sockets in OpenMosix.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An interest point detection scheme is presented that is comparable in quality to existing&#xd;
methods, but can be performed much faster. The detection is based on a straightforward color&#xd;
analysis at a coarse granularity. A 3x3 grid of squares is centered on the candidate point, so that&#xd;
the candidate point corresponds to the middle square. If the color of the center region is&#xd;
inhomogeneous with all of the surrounding regions, the point is labeled as interesting. A point&#xd;
will also be labeled as interesting if a minority of the surrounding squares are homogeneous, and&#xd;
arranged in an appropriate pattern.&#xd;
Testing confirms that this detection scheme is much faster than the state-of-the-art. It is&#xd;
also repeatable, even under different viewing conditions. The detector is robust with respect to&#xd;
changes in viewpoint, lighting, zoom, and to a certain extent, rotation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ractopamine is a repartitioning agent that can increase muscle growth and has led to our interest in determining the mechanisms involved in enhancing muscle growth.  Therefore, three studies were conducted to determine the impact of ractopamine on growth in cattle.  The first experiment evaluated the impact of increasing metabolizable protein supply to finishing heifers fed ractopamine.  Three different diets were fed to increase the amount of metabolizable protein reaching the small intestine, and the diets contained urea, solvent soybean meal, or expeller soybean meal as the primary supplemental protein source.  From this study it was determined that increasing metabolizable protein supply above that present in typical feedlot diets containing urea and steam-flaked corn is not necessary to improve responsiveness to ractopamine.  The second experiment evaluated the effect of feeding ractopamine to growing Holstein steers implanted with trenbolone acetate/estradiol.  Half of the steers were implanted 28 days prior to all steers receiving ractopamine for the final 28 days; this model represents an intense implant program.  The mode of action of the ractopamine and of steroidal implants was different based on their different effects on serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and longissimus expression of IGF-I mRNA.  Additionally, administering a combination of the two growth promotants, based on nitrogen retention, yields a less than additive response using our model of growing Holstein steers.  The third study was conducted to evaluate the differential response to ractopamine of implanted, finishing steers and heifers.  Treatments were steer vs. heifer and 0 vs. 200 mg/d ractopamine fed for the final 28 days.  This study attempted to address some questions generated from the previous study, which were how serum and local tissue production of IGF-I are affected by ractopamine.  Ractopamine had different effects on serum IGF-I between steers and heifers and numerically increased IGF-I mRNA abundance in longissimus and biceps femoris muscles.  Additionally, ractopamine impacted protein turnover differently in different muscles and changed myosin heavy chain IIA expression.  The effect of ractopamine on IGF-I warrants more research.  These experiments aid in our understanding of the mode of action of ractopamine in cattle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ehrlichia chaffeensis, an emerging tick-borne pathogen, causes human monocytic&#xd;
ehrlichiosis (HME). The relationship between E. chaffeensis and its target cells in ticks and&#xd;
vertebrates is critical as the organism must persist in them. We hypothesize that E. chaffeensis&#xd;
alters gene expression in support of adapting to dual hosts. In support of testing this&#xd;
hypothesis, we developed an ORF-based microarray and performed global transcriptional&#xd;
analysis on the pathogen grown in macrophage and tick cells. The analysis revealed the&#xd;
expression of about 30% of all the predicted E. chaffeensis genes, in macrophages or tick cell.&#xd;
Two-thirds of the transcribed genes are common for both host cell backgrounds. About 20% of&#xd;
the commonly expressed genes also varied in expression levels which ranged from two to five&#xd;
fold. Microarray data was verified by RT-PCR for a subset of randomly selected genes.&#xd;
Together, this is the first report describing the global host cell-specific gene expression patterns&#xd;
in E. chaffeensis.&#xd;
Differential gene expression may be an important adaptive mechanism used by E.&#xd;
chaffeensis for its continued survival in dual hosts. To test this hypothesis, we established&#xd;
many basic protocols and tools needed for performing mutational analysis in E. chaffeensis.&#xd;
Four antibiotic selection markers; gentamicin, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin and rifampin, and&#xd;
two promoters constitutively expressed in E. chaffeensis, genes rpsL and tr, were identified.&#xd;
Two regions of the genome were also identified for performing initial mutational analysis.&#xd;
Several plasmid constructs were also made. The optimal conditions for introducing these&#xd;
plasmids into host cell-free viable E. chaffeensis organisms were also established. The&#xd;
molecular evaluation of several E. chaffeensis transformants using these plasmids suggested&#xd;
that the plasmids gained entry, but failed to get integrated into the genome or remain in the&#xd;
bacteria for longer periods of time.&#xd;
In summary, we demonstrated global host cell-specific differential gene expression in E.&#xd;
chaffeensis by employing microarray analysis. Numerous host-specific expressed genes will be&#xd;
important for studies leading to effective methods of control. We also established several basic&#xd;
protocols and tools needed for performing mutational analysis useful in evaluating the impact of&#xd;
the loss of expression of uniquely expressed genes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Wireless sensor networks are characterized by severe energy constraints, one to many&#xd;
flows and low rate redundant data. Most of the routing algorithms for traditional networks&#xd;
are address centric, and the ad hoc nature of wireless sensor network makes them unsuitable&#xd;
for practical applications. Also the algorithms designed for mobile ad hoc networks are&#xd;
unsuitable for wireless sensor networks due to severe energy constraints that require nodes to&#xd;
perform for months with limited resources, as well as the low data rate which the constraint&#xd;
implies.&#xd;
    This thesis examines a model driven data gathering algorithm framework for wireless&#xd;
sensor networks. It was designed with a goal to decrease the overall cost in transmission&#xd;
by lowering the number of messages transmitted in the network. A combination of data-&#xd;
centric and address-centric approaches was used as guidelines during the design process. A&#xd;
shortest path heuristic where intermediate nodes forward interest messages whenever it is&#xd;
of lower cost is one of the heuristics used. Another heuristic used is the greedy incremental&#xd;
approach to build a lower cost tree from a graph with various producers and consumers. A&#xd;
cost division heuristic is used to divide cost of shared path into distinct paths as the path&#xd;
forks in a tree.&#xd;
    This thesis analyzes the effects of these heuristics on the performance of the algorithm&#xd;
and how it lowers the overall cost with the addition of each heuristic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objective of this project is to address the problem of data consistency in sensor network applications. An application may involve data being gathered from several sources to be delivered to multiple sinks, resulting in multiple data streams with several sources and sinks for each stream. There may be several inter-stream constraints to be satisfied in order to ensure data consistency. In this report, we model this problem as that of variable sharing between the components in an application, and propose a framework for implementing variable sharing in a distributed sensor network. In this framework, we define the notion of variable sharing in component based systems. We allow the application designer to specify data consistency constraints in an application. Given an application, we implement a tool to identify various types of shared variables in an application. Given the shared variables and the data consistency constraints, we provide an infrastructure to implement the shared variables. This infrastructure has tools to synthesize the code to be deployed on each of the nodes in the physical topology.  The infrastructure has been built for the TinyOS platform.  We have evaluated the framework using several examples using the TOSSIM simulator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A study was performed to determine the minimum effective dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) needed to induce ovulation of follicles in cattle (Exp. 1).  Another study determined the effects of replacing the first injection of GnRH (d -7) with hCG or saline in a Resynch-Ovsynch protocol [injection of GnRH 7 d before and 48 h after PGF[subscript2alpha] before a resynchronized fixed-timed AI (TAI)] on pregnancy rates in cows diagnosed not pregnant and pregnancy survival in cows diagnosed pregnant (d 0; Exp. 2).  A final study determined the ovulation potential of hCG compared with GnRH and saline (Exp. 3).  In Exp. 1, ovaries of Holstein cows were mapped by using transrectal ultrasonography 7 d before pregnancy diagnosis.  Cows were assigned to treatments of saline, 100 [Mu]g of GnRH, or 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 3,000 IU of hCG.  Ovarian structures were monitored 7 d later and proportion of cows and follicles that ovulated were recorded.  In Exp. 2, cows in 4 herds were assigned to treatments of 1,000 IU of hCG, 100 [Mu]g of GnRH, or left as untreated controls 7 d before pregnancy diagnosis.  Nonpregnant cows were given PGF[subscript2alpha] (d 0), then inseminated 72 h later, concurrent with a GnRH injection. Pregnancy rates tended (P = 0.08) to be increased by GnRH (17.9%; n = 703) compared with control (12.9%; n = 505), but not hCG (16.5%; n = 541).  Incidences of ovulation in nonpregnant cows (Exp. 3) were: hCG (51.6%; n = 126), GnRH (46.1%; n = 102), and control (28.1%; n = 96), whereas those in pregnant cows were: hCG (59.3%; n = 59), GnRH (24.5%; n = 49), and control (6.9%; n = 58).  We concluded that: 1) a minimum dose of 1,000 IU of hCG resulted in a greater ovulatory response than saline, GnRH, or 500 IU of hCG (Exp. 1); 2) initiating a Resynch-Ovsynch protocol 7 d before pregnancy diagnosis with saline reduced timed AI pregnancy rates (Exp. 2); and 3) incidence of new CL was greater after hCG than GnRH in pregnant cows, but not in nonpregnant cows (Exp. 3).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) is a lightweight concrete building material cut into masonry blocks or formed larger planks and panels.  Currently it has not seen widespread use in the United States.  However, in other parts of the world it use has been used successfully as a building material for over fifty years.  AAC is a relatively new (at least to the United States) concrete masonry material that is lightweight, easy to construct, and economical to transport.  Its light weight is accomplished through the use of evenly distributed microscopic air bubbles throughout the material; these bubbles result in a lightweight concrete that is composed of a latticework around spherical voids.  This report details the history, physical properties, manufacturing process, and structural design of AAC.  This report includes an explanation of the 2005 Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Code for the design of AAC members subjected to axial compressive loads, bending, combined axial and bending, and shear.  An example building design using AAC structural components is provided.  This report concludes that AAC has important advantages as a structural building material that deserves further consideration for use in the United States.</dc:description>

<dc:description>One of the worst pollution menaces of modern times is plastic packaging, because of its poor degradability. Packaging materials based on starch utilize the benefits of natural polymerization, abundant availability of raw material, and fast biodegradability. However, the highly hydrophilic nature and poor mechanical properties of starch based films limit their application. This problem was sought to be overcome by forming a nanocomposite of starch and layered silicate clay. This study utilizes melt extrusion processing to synthesize starch-clay nanocomposites for biodegradable packaging films and investigate the effects of chemical compatibility of starch, plasticizer and nanoclay and melt extrusion conditions on the structure and properties of composite films. In the first part of the study, the influence of clay type, clay content, starch source and amylose content was investigated. Starch-montmorillonite (MMT) hybrids showed an intercalated nanostructure due to the compatibility of the two components and led to cast film with higher tensile strength and better water vapor barrier properties as compared to starch-organically modified montmorillonite (I30E) hybrids, as well as native starch only. With increase in clay content (0-21 wt%), significantly higher (15-92%) tensile strength (TS) and lower (22-67%) water vapor permeability (WVP) were obtained. The results indicated that nanocomposite technology could be applied to improve the properties of starch-based packaging films. The barrier and mechanical properties of nanocomposite films did not vary significantly with different starch sources (corn, wheat and potato starch), whereas films from regular corn starch showed better properties than either high amylopectin or high amylose-based nanocomposite films. The second part of the study investigated the effects of glycerol content (0-20 wt%) and three plasticizers (glycerol, urea, formamide) on the structure and properties of the starch-clay nanocomposite films. With decreasing glycerol content, the extent of clay exfoliation increased. Films with 5% glycerol exhibited the lowest WVP, and the highest TS and glass transition temperature (Tg). The use of urea and formamide improved the dispersion of clay platelets. Compared to glycerol and urea, formamide has an intermediate hydrogen bond forming ability with starch. However, at the same level of plasticizer (15 wt%), formamide plasticized nanocomposite films exhibited the lowest WVP, highest TS and Tg. Results indicated that a balance of interactions between starch, clay surface modifications and plasticizers might control the formation of nanocomposite structure, and in turn affect the performance of the nanocomposite films. The last part of the study investigated the effects of extrusion conditions (screw configuration, barrel temperature profile, screw speed and barrel moisture content) on the structure and properties of the starch-clay nanocomposite films. Increasing the shear intensity significantly improved the exfoliation and dispersion of clay platelets. The combination of lowest barrel moisture content (20%) and high shear screw configuration exhibited almost complete clay exfoliation and the lowest WVP and highest TS of all treatments. Increasing the barrel temperature also improved clay exfoliation and performance of films. The results suggested that, when polymer and clay are chemically compatible, optimization of process conditions (shear intensity, temperature etc.) can enable significant improvement in clay exfoliation and dispersion and the performance of nanocomposite films.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Umbilical cord matrix stem (UCMS) cells are derived from Wharton's jelly and have been shown to express genes characteristic of primitive stem cells.  They can be isolated in large numbers in a short time and thus potentially represent an abundant source of cells for therapeutic use.  We investigated the migratory nature of human UCMS cells towards MDA 231 human breast carcinoma cells in an in vitro model of cell migration; UCMS cells cultured with or without MDA 231 cells for 24 hours.  Next, we evaluated the effect of chemokines, stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on human UCMS cells by treating with increasing doses of SDF-1 and VEGF.  UCMS cells were found to migrate towards MDA 231 cells in a dose dependent manner.  Both SDF-1 and VEGF induced migration of UCMS cells in a dose dependent manner.  These results suggest that MDA 231 cells might be releasing chemokine factors, such as SDF-1 and VEGF, which promote UCMS cell migration towards the tumor cells in vitro.  Stem cells that migrate to tumors may allow targeted delivery of therapeutic agents that otherwise may have severe side effects.  To evaluate the selective engraftment and therapeutic efficiency of human UCMS cells that were engineered to express interferon beta (UCMS-IFN-beta) MDA 231 cells (2,000,000) were intravenously injected into severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice, followed by three weekly intravenous injections of fluorescently labeled UCMS-IFN-beta cells (500,000).  To evaluate the synergistic effect of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and IFN-beta, MDA 231 cells were intravenously injected into SCID mice, followed by three weekly intravenous injections of fluorescently labeled UCMS-IFN-beta cells and three weekly intra peritoneal injections of 5-FU.  In both of the above experiments, mice were euthanized one week after the last UCMS cell transplant and lung weights were compared to the controls to determine the differences in tumor burden.  After transplantation of UCMS-IFN-beta cells into MDA 231 tumor-bearing mice, UCMS cells were found near or within metastatic lung tumors but not in other tissues, and in these animals, the lung weight was significantly less than MDA 231 tumor-bearing animals that received saline injections.  Histologically, there was significant reduction in the tumor area in MDA 231 tumor bearing lungs after UCMS-IFN-beta treatment.  When 5-FU was given along with UCMS-IFN-beta cells, there was further reduction in tumor area.  These results indicate that UCMS cells can potentially be used for targeted delivery of cancer therapeutics.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It is often argued that women have a tendency to be more risk averse than men. This thesis looks deeper into this sophisticated relationship between women, men and money, and investigates the gender differences among U.S. hedge fund managers. Prior research has considered the relationship between mutual fund performance and fund manager characteristics focusing on age, tenure, and level of education. &#xd;
However, none of these previous studies have looked in depth at the hedge fund arena. I hypothesize that female fund managers take less risk and follow less extreme investment styles that remain more constant over time. This suggests that less trading by female managers takes place with lower portfolio turnover, and results in superior net returns. I expected female money managers to be less overconfident and therefore would then trade less. Despite the similarities between female and male managers, I found evidence supporting my hypothesis that gender does indeed influence the decision making process for both investors and the hedge fund management companies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As our society continues to better prepare itself to address biological, radiological, chemical, and environmental emergencies, there is a need for better and more readily available emergency planning information for program managers and military/business personnel. An online hazardous materials and emergency planning tool for the Environmental Knowledge and Assessment Tool (EKAT:  www.ekat-tool.com) would adequately fill that need.&#xd;
The proposed online Emergency Preparation and Green Engineering (EPGE) tool would provide the user with information regarding links to local emergency response teams and resources, guides for developing emergency plans and reports, Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) training information, case studies to illustrate HAZMAT situations, and the ability to judge the environmental friendliness of chemicals. In this way it will serve as a means of facilitating and educating individuals for best responses in an organized fashion. &#xd;
 In order to address their environmental responsibilities, public and private organizations are adopting Environmental Management Systems (EMS). The EPGE tool can be used in conjunction with Environmental Management Systems (EMS) to begin to address sustainability in a more practical setting.  Currently the development of a comprehensive tool that identifies environmental, health, and safety concerns along with supplying relevant emergency data would be applicable to any business or organization.  This tool will be available as an initial building block for the sustainability of the company.  It can be used as a guide to better characterize and solve the environmental issues that could affect any business.</dc:description>

<dc:description>My work focused on understanding adipocyte function and regulation because of the importance to diabetes. In addition to being a fat storage depot, adipose tissue is an endocrine tissue. Adiponectin and leptin are two adipokines that control insulin sensitivity and energy balance. In spite of their importance, there are still questions about their secretion. I hypothesized that leptin and adiponectin follow different secretory routes. I found adiponectin localized in Golgi and the trans Golgi Network, while leptin mostly localized in ER during basal metabolisms.  Common requirements for their secretion were the presence of class III Arf proteins and an intact Golgi apparatus, since BFA treatment inhibited secretion of both adiponectin and leptin.  I found that trafficking of adiponectin is dependent on GGA1 coated vesicles.  Endosomal inactivation significantly reduced adiponectin, but not leptin, secretion in both 3T3L1 and isolated rat adipocytes.  Also, adiponectin, but not leptin, secretion was reduced in cells expressing non- functional form of Rab11 and Rab5 proteins. However, secretion of leptin, but not adiponectin was inhibited in cells expressing mutants of Protein Kinase D1. These results suggest that leptin and adiponectin secretion involve distinct intracellular compartments and pathways.&#xd;
Insulin resistance is associated with macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue and elevated levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta Therefore, the second part of my dissertation tested the hypothesis that the interaction of macrophages and adipocytes causes insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis, I co-cultured macrophages and adipocytes. I found that mouse elicited peritoneal macrophages significantly decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in a contact-independent manner.  IL-6 was the most inhibitory cytokine in reducing GLUT4 translocation, GLUT4 expression, Akt phsphorylation and reducing adipocyte differentiation compared to TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. These data suggest that IL-6 is the most effective cytokine secreted by macrophages involved in insulin resistance.  Lastly, I tested the impact of adipocytes on macrophage differentiation in vitro and in vivo.  I found that C2D macrophages isolated from the peritoneal cavity had increased IL-6 transcript levels after co-culture with 3T3L1 adipocytes in vitro. After i.p. injection, C2D macrophages isolated from WAT increased expression of mature macrophage surface markers and transcript levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared to C2D cells in vitro. However, macrophages isolated from BAT expressed low levels of cytokines and macrophage surface markers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>NC-1059 is a synthetic channel-forming peptide that provides for ion transport across, and transiently reduces barrier integrity of, cultured epithelial monolayers derived from canine kidney (MDCK cells; Broughman, J. R. et al; Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 286: C1312-23). In this first study experiments were conducted to determine whether epithelial cells derived from other sources were similarly affected. Human (T84, Calu-3) and non-human (IPEC-J2, PVD9902) epithelial cells derived from intestinal (T84, IPEC-J2), airway (Calu-3), and genitourinary (PVD9902) tissues were grown on permeable supports. Ion transport and barrier function were assessed electrically in a modified Ussing chamber. Basal short circuit current (I[subscript sc]) was typically less than 3 [Mu]A cm[superscript-2]. Apical NC-1059 exposure caused, in all cell types, an increase in I[subscript sc] to >15 [Mu]A cm[superscript-2], indicative of net anion secretion or cation absorption that was followed by an increase in transepithelial conductance (g[subscript te] in mS cm[superscript-2]; T-84, 1.6 to 62; PVD9902, 0.2 to 51; IPEC-J2, 0.3 to 26; Calu-3, 2.2 to 13). NC-1059 induces a concentration dependent change in the I[subscript sc] and g[subscript te] across these epithelia. The results in all cases were consistent with both a transcellular and a paracellular effect of the peptide. NC-1059 enhanced permeation of dextrans ranging from 10 kDa to 70 kDa across all epithelia tested. These results document an effect of NC-1059 on the paracellular route of epithelial barriers. Immunolabeling, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting methods were used in a second study to assess the molecular changes associated with increased paracellular permeability. NC-1059 induced a substantial reorganization of actin within 60 minutes of exposure. Confocal microscopy revealed that the changes in actin organization were accompanied by a pronounced change in the abundance and distribution of tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. Immunoblotting results suggest a time and concentration dependent effect on cellular abundance of these tight junction proteins.  The effects on g[subscript te] and junctional proteins are transient with > 85% of recovery in 24 hours post exposure and full recovery within 48 hours. The reversible modulation of the epithelial tight junctions has therapeutic potential to increase the efficiency of drug delivery across barrier membranes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1989, the United States Marine Corps published the document Fleet Marine Force Manual 1, Warfighting. Its appearance signaled the official adoption of maneuver warfare as the Corps's organizational philosophy and the basis of its doctrine for preparing and conducting operations.  The decade of debate and experimentation that preceded the publication of Warfighting has not received detailed examination, but merits such for the insights it can provide to understanding intellectual change and military reform. &#xd;
 Beginning in 1979, Marine Corps officers engaged in an intraservice debate over the issue of maneuver warfare, a new concept that began to circulate among military reformers in the latter half of the 1970s.  A group of Marine officers known as "maneuverists" began meeting in unofficial seminars to study, refine, and promote the idea.  Maneuverists believed that maneuver warfare was a more fluid and dynamic way of fighting because it stressed flexibility, creativity, and a focus on enemy behavior.  They also thought the new idea offered a more effective alternative for fighting war than contemporary practices, which they thought focused too much on rigid application of standardized procedures and methods of existing manuals.  The intellectual transformation of the Marine Corps involved three main mechanisms.  The first was a theoretical mechanism centered on public debate in the pages of Marine Corps Gazette to introduce and defend maneuver warfare to Marine audience.  The second was a functional/practical mechanism that involved educational and training initiatives at the Amphibious Warfare School and Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  The third mechanism was the use of institutional authority made possible with the appointment of General Alfred M. Gray, a senior and vocal maneuver warfare champion, to the position Commandant of the Marine Corps.  Using the authority of his office, Gray directed the writing of a doctrinal manual encapsulating the ideas of maneuver warfare to provide the Corps organizational focus and direction.  The resulting manual FMFM 1, Warfighting, officially adopted maneuver warfare as service doctrine and organizational warfighting philosophy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Potassium bromate is a well-known strong chemical oxidant.  It was once widely used by the baking industry all over the world, especially for making frozen doughs.  Since potassium bromate has been banned in many countries, many researchers have studied in this area to find a replacement.  Ascorbic acid was often combined with potassium bromate in frozen dough making as an oxidant dough additive.  In addition, ascorbic acid has different chemical oxidant activity, and its function in yeast leavened dough is not as strong as is potassium bromate.  More dough additives have been found, such as enzymes.  Enzymes play key roles in bread making.  In recent years, enzyme usage in bread making has been increasing, especially for shelf-life extension.&#xd;
Based on the results from this research, potassium bromate use can be replaced by a combination of ascorbic acid and hemicellulase/endoxylanase.  However, using hemicellulase/endoxylanase alone cannot benefit frozen dough quality such as finer crumb cell or increasing final bread volume.&#xd;
These experimental results also show that using a combination of ascorbic acid and hemicellulase/endoxylanase can delay the development of bread firmness (staling) after baking.  As frozen storage time increased, the firmness of frozen dough bread increased, and the bread tended to have a coarser texture.  Hence, larger and uneven grain cells reflect a gray or dark crumb color.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Throughout this report, I focused on how the mother-child relationship is affected following the loss of a husband/father. I started with a case study and followed with the effects of losing a spouse, the effects of losing a parent, specifically how the mother-child relationship is impacted, and ended with a recommendation for a course of therapy, referencing back to the case study presented in the opening chapter. The loss of a husband/father is an extremely difficult occurrence, and as illustrated in this report, will have a lasting impact on the complexities of the mother-child relationship.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We investigated spatial variation in fish assemblage and food web structure in the Kansas River, USA in relation to habitat changes.  Fishes were collected at ten sites throughout the Kansas River for assessing assemblage structure in summer 2007 using fish community metrics and at 3 sites in 2006 for food web structure using stable isotope analysis.  Satellite imagery indicated riparian habitat on the Kansas River was dominated by agriculture in the upper reaches (>35%) and tended to increase in urban land use in the lower reaches (>58%).  Instream habitat complexity also decreased with increased urban area (&lt;25%) becoming more channelized.  Jaccard's similarity and percent similarity indices suggested that large-bodied fishes show changes in species presence and composition longitudinally within the river.  Also, reaches directly above Bowersock Dam in Lawrence, Kansas and below the Johnson County Weir, near Kansas City, Kansas had low percent similarity compared to other reaches, suggesting the dam and the weir affect community composition.  Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that species that prefer high velocity flows and sandy substrate (blue sucker and shovelnose sturgeon) are associated with the upper river reaches.  Also, there was a higher abundance of omnivorous and planktivorous fish species in the lower more channelized river.  The lower reaches contain more tolerant, macrohabitat generalist species and the upper river contained more intolerant, fluvial specialist species.  Fish, macroinvertebrates, and detritus were collected at three river reaches classified as the heterogeneous instream habitat (>40% grass islands and sand bars) intermediate (22% grass islands and sand bars), and homogeneous (6% grass islands and sand bars) instream habitat reaches in June 2006.  Riparian land use (proportion as agricultural and urban) was related to instream habitat with homogeneous areas having more urban riparian area compared to the heterogeneous and intermediate reaches.  The heterogeneous habitat reach had higher variability in [Delta][superscript]13C for fish classified as piscivores/invertivores (P=0.029) and macroinvertebrates (P=0.004) suggesting the complex habitat in the heterogeneous habitat reach provided more variable food sources.  The [Delta}15N values also indicated that ten of the twelve fish species tended to consume prey at higher trophic levels in the heterogeneous habitat reach suggesting a more complex food web.  Land use practices are leading to homogenization of instream habitat and this homogenization of habitats may be related to food web diversity and trophic position of fishes.  Conserving intolerant, native species in the Kansas River may require maintaining suitable habitat for these species and restoration of impacted areas of the river.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Escherichia coli O157, a food-borne human pathogen, causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome.  Cattle are a major reservoir and the organism resides in the hindgut and is shed in the feces.  Cattle feces are a major source of food and water contamination.  Houseflies feed on cattle manure and are a source of E. coli O157 transmission.  We have observed that houseflies have an affinity for a steam-flaked corn product (SFC-36) made from tempered whole corn that is more ruminally digestible than the traditional SFC (SFC-18).  Therefore, we investigated whether SFC-36 diets contained and resulted in higher E. coli concentrations in the feces of cattle compared to SFC-18 diets.  Concentrations of E. coli were not different between the two SFC diet samples, but resulted in higher coliforms in diets containing the SFC-36 after exposure to the environment.  However, E. coli concentrations in feces from cattle fed the two diets were similar.  In fact, cattle fed the diet containing SFC-18 flakes actually shed higher concentrations of coliforms.  This led us to speculate that starch digestion may have an effect on the growth of E. coli O157 in the hindgut.  We determined whether fecal E. coli O157 was related to fecal starch concentration.  Steers (n=263) were sampled for E. coli O157 and fecal starch concentration determinations.  Steers positive for E. coli O157 contained 21% more (P &lt; 0.05) fecal starch than steers that were negative for E. coli O157.  We attempted to alter the concentration of starch escaping rumen fermentation by feeding diets based on SFC and dry-rolled corn (DRC) to 30 heifers prescreened for being culture positive for fecal E. coli O157.  Heifers were sampled for feces and by rectoanal mucosal swab (RAMS) weekly to monitor fecal pH and fecal starch concentration, and prevalence of E. coli O157.  Based on RAMS, prevalence of E. coli O157 tended to be higher (P = 0.08) for heifers fed SFC than DRC diet.  Fecal starch and pH were similar (P > 0.05) between positive- or negative-E. coli O157 heifers.  Apparently, fecal E. coli O157 was not related to fecal pH or starch concentration in cattle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recently, virtualization was proposed in many scientific fields. Virtualization is widely applied in telecommunications where networks are required to be extremely flexible to meet the current and the unpredictable future requirements. The creation of a virtual network over the physical network allows the application developers to design new services provided to the users without modifying the underlay resources. The creation of a virtual network of light paths and light trees over the optical network allows the resources managers to utilize the huge optical capacity more efficiently.&#xd;
In this thesis, we consider the optimal topology design for the virtual networks taking into consideration traffic demands and quality of service constraints of the applications. Considered examples of virtual networks are the overlay networks at the application layer and the virtual light path and light tree networks at the optical layer. &#xd;
In the design of overlay topologies, the performance of the virtual networks is affected by traffic characteristic, and behavior of nodes which can be selfish or cooperative. Both the static and dynamic traffic demand scenarios are considered. The static demand scenario follows well known probability distributions, while in the dynamic traffic scenario, the traffic matrix is predicted through measurements over each link in the network. We study the problem of finding the overlay topology that minimizes a cost function which takes into account the overlay link creation cost and the routing cost. We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming and propose heuristics to find near-optimal overlay topologies with a reduced complexity.&#xd;
Virtual optical networks are designed to support many applications. Multicast sessions are an example of the applications running over the optical network. The main objective in creating the hybrid topology, composed by light paths and light trees, is to increase number of supported multicast sessions through sharing the network resources. The problem of establishing the hybrid topology is formulated using the Integer Linear Programming. Extensive data results and analysis are performed on the generated hybrid topologies for evaluation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Buildings account for a large part of total U.S. energy consumption and generate far more&#xd;
greenhouse gas emissions than any other sector of the economy. The purpose of this thesis is to&#xd;
demonstrate how buildings can be designed in a way that helps to mitigate global environmental&#xd;
problems, while resolving local urban design, architecture and social issues.&#xd;
This purpose was achieved by designing a zero-energy garage apartment for a site located&#xd;
along an alley in Manhattan, Kansas. The methodology for the design was to: identify a client;&#xd;
define project goals and design criteria; determine solar and geothermal renewable energy&#xd;
system requirements; design the garage apartment by employing energy efficient strategies&#xd;
relating to bioregional design and passive solar design; identify eco-friendly materials obtainable&#xd;
within a 500-mile radius of the site; and identify energy-efficient construction methods. The&#xd;
energy performance of the garage apartment was constantly monitored using eQUEST and&#xd;
Energy-10 simulation softwares.&#xd;
Operational definitions:&#xd;
Garage apartment- a building behind the main building[superscript]1, which is part of the same plot as the&#xd;
main building. It is also called a 'backhouse', 'granny flat' or a 'rear house'.&#xd;
Zero-energy house- for this thesis, a grid connected self-standing zero-energy house, which&#xd;
results in zero utility bills throughout the year.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Four experiments using 350 pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary nutrients on the incidence of osteochondrosis (OC) and to evaluate the use of biomarkers to predict its occurrence in growing-finishing pigs.  The first experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential of dietary ingredients with known functions in cartilage and bone metabolism on incidence of OC in pigs (PIC 327 × 1050, initially 39 kg).  Results suggest that pigs fed high levels of added copper and manganese, silicon, methionine and threonine, or proline and glycine had reduced OC severity scores.  A second experiment evaluated other dietary ingredients that may impact OC as well as with or without ractopamine HCl (PIC 327 × 1050, initially 47 kg).  Results suggest that feeding a combination of added methionine, manganese, proline, and glycine or added silicon can numerically reduce OC severity scores compared to pigs fed a standard corn-soybean meal based diet.  Feeding ractopamine HCl did not affect the incidence or severity of OC.  A third experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary lysine concentration with or without the addition of high methionine, manganese, and copper in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement in growing-finishing pigs (PIC 327 × 1050, initially 41 kg).  Results suggest that increasing dietary lysine concentrations increased the severity of OC.  Furthermore, feeding additional methionine, manganese, and copper reduced OC severity scores.  A fourth experiment was conducted to determine the usefulness of ten different biomarkers of cartilage and bone metabolism to predict the incidence of OC and the correlation of individual markers with the severity of OC.  Results suggest that measuring serum C-propeptide of type II collagen (CPII) will predict animals with OC, as gilts with a two-fold increase in CPII are 97 times more likely to have OC.  As well, serum collagen type II carboxy-terminal 3/4 long fragment (C2C) explained 49% of the variation in OC severity scores.  The results of these experiments suggest that feeding added copper, manganese, methionine, silicon, or proline and glycine may reduce OC severity scores in pigs, while measuring biomarkers CPII and C2C can aid in determining animals with OC.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gibberella zeae is an ascomycete filamentous fungus and the major cause of Fusarium head&#xd;
blight, also called scab, in small grains. This dissertation contains three related studies of G.&#xd;
zeae. In the first, the genetic map was aligned with the first assembly of the genomic sequence&#xd;
released by The Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA). Approximately 99% of the sequence was&#xd;
anchored to the genetic map, indicating the high quality of the sequence assembly and validity of&#xd;
the genetic map. The alignments grouped the linkage groups and supercontigs into four sets,&#xd;
which is consistent with the hypothesis that there are four chromosomes in this fungus. In the&#xd;
second, the sex pheromone precursor genes (ppg1 and ppg2) and the pheromone receptor genes&#xd;
(pre1 and pre2) were identified and characterized. Deletion of ppg1 or pre2 ([Delta]ppg1 or [Delta]pre2&#xd;
strains) reduced the number of perithecia produced by self-fertilization, but did not completely&#xd;
block perithecial formation. The proportion of crosses resulting from outcrossing increased&#xd;
when the [Delta]ppg1 strains were used as the female in crosses with male strains containing an intact&#xd;
ppg1 gene. [Delta]ppg2 and [Delta]pre1 mutants had no discernable effect on morphological phenotype or&#xd;
self-fertilization. Thus, one of the pheromone/receptor pairs (ppg1/pre2) found in many&#xd;
Ascomycetes has a role in, but is not essential for, selfing or outcrossing in G. zeae, whereas the&#xd;
other pheromone/receptor pair (ppg2/pre1) no longer has a detectable function in sexual&#xd;
reproduction. In the third study, spore germination of G. zeae was tested in the presence of α-&#xd;
factor-like pheromone peptides of G. zeae or N. crassa. The pheromone peptide of N. crassa&#xd;
more efficiently inhibited spore germination than did the peptide from G. zeae. Arginine and&#xd;
lysine residues were the most important determinants in blocking spore germination. In&#xd;
conclusion, this research has validated the genetic map and the genomic assembly of G. zeae,&#xd;
characterized sex pheromone functions and characterized pheromone peptide ability to inhibit&#xd;
spore germination. The pheromone peptides of G. zeae and N. crassa may be useful as control&#xd;
agents for G. zeae and pheromone peptide efficacy might be further enhanced by judicious&#xd;
substitutions for some of the amino acids.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Early in embryonic development a series of events occur whereby pluripotent cells undergo differentiation to give rise to the three germ layers and extraembryonic tissues of the developing conceptus.  Nanog, Sox-2, and Oct-4 genes have been identified as having key roles in maintaining pluripotency in undifferentiated human and mouse cells but recent evidence suggests they may have different roles in farm animals.  We cloned the coding sequence for porcine Nanog including 452 base pairs of the Nanog promoter, and partial coding sequences of Oct-4 and Sox-2.  Embryos were flushed from sows 10, 12, 15, and 17 days post insemination.  RNA was isolated from whole d-10 and -12 conceptuses, d-15 embryonic disk, distal and proximal extraembryonic tissue, and d-17 embryonic disk, distal and proximal extraembryonic tissue, and allantois for real-time PCR.  RNA from d-40 maternal myometrium and endometrium, fetal placenta, and liver were also used in real-time PCR.  The homeodomain and c-terminal tryptophan repeats are highly conserved in porcine Nanog compared to the mouse, human and bovine.  In the promoter, the highly conserved Octamer and Sox binding sequences are also present.  The Nanog expression pattern was different when compared to Oct-4 and Sox-2.  Day-40 tissues demonstrated the highest expression including endometrium (7 fold) fetal liver (27 fold), placenta (40 fold) and myometrium (72 fold) when compared to day 15 distal extraembryonic tissue.  Oct-4 and Sox-2 expression was lowest in d-40 tissues except for fetal liver which was 20 and 71 fold, respectively, higher than endometrium.  Oct-4 levels were consistent in d-10, -12, and -15 conceptuses and disk but dropped 3 fold in d-17 disk.  On the other hand, Sox-2 was upregulated a 1000 fold in the d-15 disk and 2000 fold in the d-17 disk when compared to the d-12 conceptus.  Nanog may have other roles in than maintenance of pluripotency including a possible role in multipotent or progenitor stem cells.  Expression of all 3 markers in fetal liver suggests a more primitive cell type is present such as hematopoietic stem cells.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ozonation was studied as an alternative to chlorination for cake flour. Ozone treatment in a wooden tumbler at room temperature was conducted. Unchlorinated flour was treated with ozone at the rate of 0.06 L/min for 10 and 36 min using 5 lb of flour. Ozonation of cake flour decreased pH and increased the lightness (L value) of flour. Baking studies using a high-ratio white layer cake formulation showed that the volume of cakes significantly increased (p&lt; 0.05) as ozonation time increased and cakes were softer than those made with chlorinated or control flours. The cell brightness and number of cells measured by image analysis (C-Cell) of cakes from ozone treated flour for 36 min exhibited similar values to those from chlorinated flour. Cakes made from flours after lipid extraction and after lipid extraction plus ozonation had low volume, indicating that lipids play a role in cake performance. Identification of volatile compounds that contribute to the odor of ozone treated flour was conducted. Volatile compounds of chlorinated, unchlorinated, defatted control, and ozonated defatted flours were analyzed using a purge and trap instrument and GC-MS. Aldehydes, alcohols, hydrocarbons and other compounds were found in unchlorinated and chlorinated flours while the volatile compounds present in ozone treated flours were mainly aldehydes and ketones. A rapid reduction in volatile compounds was detected when ozone treated flours were stored uncovered in a fume hood. Ozonation of defatted soft wheat flour produced less volatile aldehydes than ozone treated whole flour. &#xd;
The optimum temperature and time for ozone treatment in a metal tumbler using a response surface methodology design was studied. Time (5, 15, and 25 min) and temperature (25, 35 and 45 [degrees]C) was used with three response parameters. The optimum ozonation time was about 8 to 11 min with the temperature range between 36 and 46 [degrees]C. Ozone treatment for 5 to 25 min at room temperature showed an increase in unextractable polymeric protein, indicating a shift of protein to a higher molecular weight. Increase in Mixograph peak time, peak viscosity, and water retention capacity were observed as ozonation time increased. The ozone treatment did not affect the transition temperature and enthalpy change of the flour samples.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study focused on migrant parent involvement in the educational experience of their children.  Specifically, the study investigated parent involvement in the domains of  &#xd;
(1) Community Setting, (2) School Setting, (3) and Home Setting, and its relationship to student achievement in reading and mathematics assessments. Research has clearly indicated that parent involvement in the education processes of children is a critical facet to their academic success.  Nevertheless, research has also indicated that parent involvement programming in educational institutions has been structured to address a stable, middle class, language and culturally homogeneous patron. Given the dynamics that impact migrant families, districts that are heavily impacted by migrant families must ameliorate parent involvement programming to address the unique needs of migrant families and their children.&#xd;
	The participants in the study comprised 51 migrant families. The response rate for participation in the study consisted of 25% of the total migrant population within the school district. Data were gathered through a survey and an interview.&#xd;
	Four research hypotheses were identified and tested. The procedure employed to test the strength of the relationship between the individual domains and the scores was the Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation. Additionally, a two-tailed test was used as the procedure for all hypotheses tested. The results indicated that there was not a significant relationship between the domains and student achievement scores. Nevertheless, there was variability among the students' achievement scores despite the level of involvement demonstrated by the parents.  Therefore, based on the range of scores, student success was not predicated on the level of engagement that parents demonstrated on the survey.  Other factors accounted for the academic success or failure of the student.  These factors may have included constraints such as teacher training and dispositions, the level of second language development that the child possessed, and the resiliency of the student. Nevertheless, for students within the same family, where one student scored extremely high and the other child scored extremely low, parent involvement could have been the deciding variable that could have assisted the low scoring child succeed academically, if the parent training had taken into consideration the factors that impact migrant families.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We hypothesized that the increase in mitochondrial proliferation in hearts from copper-deficient rats is due to an increase in expression of the transcriptional factor Ppargc1a, which regulates transcriptional activity for many of the genes that encode for mitochondrial proteins.  In addition to several transcriptional factors implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, we also looked at a number of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and fuel substrate utilization.  Long-Evans rats were placed on either a copper-adequate (n=4) or copper-deficient (n=4) diet 3 days post-weaning and remained on the diet for five weeks; their copper deficiency status was confirmed using previously established assays.   Custom oligo arrays spotted with genes pertinent to mitochondrial biogenesis were hybridized with cRNA probes synthesized from the collected heart tissue.  Chemiluminescent array images from both groups were analyzed for gene spot intensities and differential gene expression.  Our results did not demonstrate any significant increase in Ppargc1a or its implicated targets, as we had predicted.  However, consistent with previous data, an up-regulation of genes that encode for collagen type 3, fibronectin and elastin were found.  Interestingly, there was also a significant increase in the expression of the transcriptional factor Nf kappa b1 in the copper-deficient treatment animals compared to the control group.  The results of this study merit the further investigation of the role of ROS with regard to Nf kappa b1 in the copper deficient rat heart.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis introduces a new partitioning algorithm to cluster variables in high dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data and high dimensional longitudinal low sample size (HDLLSS) data. HDLSS data contain a large number of variables with small number of replications per variable, and HDLLSS data refer to HDLSS data observed over time.&#xd;
&#xd;
	Clustering technique plays an important role in analyzing high dimensional low sample size data as is seen commonly in microarray experiment, mass spectrometry data, pattern recognition. Most current clustering algorithms for HDLSS and HDLLSS data are adaptations from traditional multivariate analysis, where the number of variables is not high and sample sizes are relatively large. Current algorithms show poor performance when applied to high dimensional data, especially in small sample size cases. In addition, available algorithms often exhibit poor clustering accuracy and stability for non-normal data. Simulations show that traditional clustering algorithms used in high dimensional data are not robust to monotone transformations.&#xd;
 &#xd;
	The proposed clustering algorithm PPCLUST is a powerful tool for clustering HDLSS data, which uses p-values from nonparametric rank tests of homogeneous distribution as a measure of similarity between groups of variables. Inherited from the robustness of rank procedure, the new algorithm is robust to outliers and invariant to monotone transformations of data. PPCLUSTEL is an extension of PPCLUST for clustering of HDLLSS data. A nonparametric test of no simple effect of group is developed and the p-value from the test is used as a measure of similarity between groups of variables.&#xd;
	&#xd;
	 PPCLUST and PPCLUSTEL are able to cluster a large number of variables in the presence of very few replications and in case of PPCLUSTEL, the algorithm require neither a large number nor equally spaced time points. PPCLUST and PPCLUSTEL do not suffer from loss of power due to distributional assumptions, general multiple comparison problems and difficulty in controlling heterocedastic variances. Applications with available data from previous microarray studies show promising results and simulations studies reveal that the algorithm outperforms a series of benchmark algorithms applied to HDLSS data exhibiting high clustering accuracy and stability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Novel genetic materials were used to deduce gluten protein composition-functionality relationships. The Pegaso bread wheat near-isogenic lines (NILs) included addition, variation and/or deletion of major loci coding for HMW-GS, LMW-GS and gliadins. The waxy wheat lines (Svevo and N11 set) included wild, partial and complete waxy lines. Triticale translocations include 1R.1D and 1A.1D lines (GDS7, Trim, Rhino and Rigel sets) with HMW-GS 5+10 and 2+12.  The main goal of the study was to establish the usefulness of NILs as appropriate materials to investigate the structure-function relationships of wheat proteins and to evaluate the performance of unique triticale translocations and waxy wheat lines. Effect of genetic variation on phytochemical (phenolic acid and policosanol) contents was also studied. Innovative methods like MALLS, Lab-on-a-chip and micro (10 g) baking were utilized along with traditional analytical methods.&#xd;
Results confirmed the potential of using NILs in understanding the effects of certain proteins coded at specific loci that might often be targeted in breeding programs. Removal of expected chain terminators at Gli-1/Gli-2 loci causes a shift in MWD to higher values, reflected in higher UPP and dough strength. Lines with HMW-GS 5+10 were clearly separated from 2+12 lines in terms of dough strength and UPP. The present study obtained evidence that modified ω-gliadins acts as chain terminators and cause reduction of protein polymer size and thus shifts in MWD. Marked differences in terms of milling characteristics, protein composition and ultimately in end-use functionality were observed with various waxy wheat null lines. Loaf volumes with waxy wheat flour alone were higher than a 50% blend with commercial wheat; however, breads were unacceptable to consumers in all aspects. Poor milling quality, very low mixing times with low bread loaf volumes were typical of all the triticales studied. However, translocation of the HMW-GS from wheat chromosome 1D increased dough strength, particularly the HMW-GS 5+10. Among the phytochemicals studied, double nulls at Gli-1 loci of Pegaso NILs had the highest total policosanols and total phenolic acid contents.Slight variation to wheat phenolic acid composition and contents were observed with waxy wheat and triticale lines.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study examined the relationships among restaurant managers' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls, using the Theory of Planned Behavior, that cause them to support or not support food safety training for their employees.  The goal of this study was to investigate the facts that affect restaurant managers' willingness to support food safety training for their employees. &#xd;
Based on the results of the elicitation study, a pilot test focus group, and a pilot study, an 85 question instrument, that measured eight constructs and demographic information was developed.  The instrument was administered via telephone, but response data was input using an online format.  Data was entered electronically as it was collected.  A total of 266 managers responded, but due to incomplete and missing data, 237 responses were usable.  The final overall response rate was 17.9%.  &#xd;
Results determined that overall intention to offer food safety training to employees was high.  Restaurant managers had a positive attitude about food safety, placed importance on the beliefs of individuals they consider important, and felt they were in control about offering food safety training to their employees.  &#xd;
Certified managers had more positive attitudes about offering food safety training and placed more emphasis on those individuals whom they considered to be important in their lives (subjective norms), but also perceived they had less control about offering food safety training to their employees.  Most importantly, those managers who were certified had a higher intention to train employees than managers who did not have food safety certification.  When comparing behavioral, normative, and control beliefs between chain and independent restaurant managers, only behavioral (specific attitudes) and normative beliefs (specific individuals whom they considered important) differed. &#xd;
In the multiple regression analysis exploring the prediction of behavior based on the respondents attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls, the model was significant (F=139.932, p [equal to or less than] .000) (Table 5.2).  The significant independent variables in the model were the attitude mean composite score (Beta=-0.106, p [equal to or less than] .038) and the subjective mean composite score (Beta=0.727, p [equal to or less than] .000).  Perception of control was not significant.&#xd;
Three multiple regression models were used to examine the relationships between the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls as dependent variables and the factors for their indirect measures as independent variables.  Of the three simple linear regression models, only two were significant.  The regression of the behavioral belief factors on attitude composite score (Hypothesis 4) (F=16.714, p [equal to or less than] .000) and the regression of normative belief factors on the subjective norm composite score (F=11.896, p [equal to or less than] .000) were significant.  The regression of control beliefs on perceived behavioral control showed no significance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recent emphasis on the ethical conduct of researchers has resulted in a growing body of literature exploring the impact of trauma-focused research on participants. To date, pregnant women have not been widely included in trauma-focused research, possibly because they are considered a vulnerable population in research. The current research investigated how 41 expectant mothers responded to participation in a trauma-focused study. Overall, the results of this study suggest that trauma-focused research is well tolerated by pregnant women. Specific findings indicated that pregnant women considered more traumatized perceived greater benefits from participation. Best practices for conducting ethical trauma-focused research with pregnant women are provided. As well, recommendations for future research are outlined in an effort to further extend the ethical understanding of the benefits and costs of trauma-focused research with potentially vulnerable populations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cooked, chilled beef and cooked, chilled pork were inoculated with three strains of Clostridium perfringens (NCTC 8238 [Hobbs serotype 2], NCTC 8239 [Hobbs serotype 3], and NCTC 10240). Inoculated products were heated to 75°C, held for 10 min in a circulating water bath to heat activate the spores, and then chilled by circulating chilled brine through the water bath. Samples were chilled from 54.4 to 26.6°C in 2 h and from 26.6 to 4.4°C in 5 h. Differences in initial C. perfringens log counts and log counts after chilling were determined and compared with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) stabilization guidelines requiring that the chilling process allow no more than 1 log total growth of C. perfringens in the finished product. This chilling method resulted in average C. perfringens increases of 0.52 and 0.68 log units in cooked beef and cooked pork, respectively. These log increases were well within the maximum 1-log increase permitted by the USDA, thus meeting the USDA compliance guidelines for the cooling of heat-treated meat and poultry products.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Inhibition of the germination and outgrowth of Clostridium perfringens by buffered sodium citrate (Ional) and buffered sodium citrate supplemented with sodium diacetate (Ional Plus) during the abusive chilling of roast beef and injected pork was evaluated. Beef top rounds or pork loins were injected with a brine containing NaCl, potato starch, and potassium tetrapyrophosphate to yield final in-product concentrations of 0.85, 0.25, and 0.20%, respectively. Products were ground and mixed with Ional or Ional Plus at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0%. Each product was mixed with a three-strain C. perfringens spore cocktail to obtain final spore concentrations of ca. 2.5 log10 spores per g. Chilling of roast beef from 54.4 to 7.2°C resulted in C. perfringens population increases of 1.51 and 5.27 log10 CFU/g for 18- and 21-h exponential chill rates, respectively, while chilling of injected pork resulted in increases of 3.70 and 4.41 log10 CFU/g. The incorporation of Ional into the roast beef formulation resulted in C. perfringens population reductions of 0.98, 1.87, and 2.47 log10 CFU/g with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% Ional, respectively, over 18 h of chilling, while 1.0% Ional Plus was required to achieve similar reductions (reductions of 0.91 and 2.07 log10 CFU/g were obtained with 1.0 and 2.0% Ional Plus, respectively). An Ional or Ional Plus concentration of 1.0% was required to reduce C. perfringens populations in roast beef or injected pork chilled from 54.4 to 7.2°C in 21 h. Cooling times for roast beef or injected pork products after heat processing can be extended to 21 h through the incorporation of 1.0% Ional or Ional Plus into the formulation to reduce the potential risk of C. perfringens germination and outgrowth.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A laboratory-scale vertical tower steam pasteurization unit was evaluated to determine the antimicrobial effectiveness of different exposure times (0, 3, 6, 12, and 15 s) and steam chamber temperatures (82.2, 87.8, 93.3, and 98.9°C) against pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria innocua) inoculated onto prerigor beef tissue. Samples were collected and microbiologically analyzed immediately before and after steam treatment to quantify the effectiveness of each time-temperature combination. The 0-s exposure at all chamber temperatures (cold water spray only, no steam treatment) was the experimental control and provided 0.3 log CFU/cm2 reductions. Chamber temperatures of 82.2 and 87.8°C were ineffective (P > 0.05) at all exposure times. At 93.3°C, significant reductions (> 1.0 log CFU/cm2) were observed at exposure times of 6 s, with 15 s providing approximately 1 log cycle greater reductions than 12 s of exposure. The 98.9°C treatment was consistently the most effective, with exposure times of 9 s resulting in >3.5 log CFU/cm2 reductions for all pathogens.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A century before bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Great Britain and North America grappled with an equally maddening disease in cattle: pleuro-pneumonia. The subject of a decades-long trade dispute in the nineteenth-century transatlantic region, pleuro-pneumonia attracted the attention of livestock farmers, diplomats, shipping moguls, veterinarians, public health regulators, and journalists. Scientific controversy aggravated the dispute; veterinary officials elaborated scientific opinions and regulatory orders amidst a prevailing confusion about microbiology and disease diagnostics. In this context emerged William Williams, an Edinburgh-based professor whose convictions spawned repeated disagreements with the British government’s diagnoses of pleuro-pneumonia in cattle from the United States and Canada.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Italian-style salami batter (formulated with pork shoulder) was inoculated with ca. 7.0 log CFU/g of either Salmonella&#xd;
or Listeria monocytogenes. Salami links (55-mm cellulose casings) were fermented at 308C for 24, 40, or 72 h and then dried&#xd;
to target moisture/protein ratios (MPRs) of 1.9:1 or 1.4:1. Links were sampled after fermentation (24, 40, and 72 h) and after&#xd;
combined fermentation-drying treatments (MPRs of 1.9:1 and 1.4:1 for all fermentation periods), and microbiological and&#xd;
proximate analyses were performed at each sampling. Pathogen populations were enumerated by direct plating on selective&#xd;
agar and by an injured-cell recovery method. When enumerated by the injured-cell recovery method, Salmonella populations&#xd;
were reduced by 1.2 to 2.1 log CFU/g after fermentation alone (24 to 72 h) and by 2.4 to 3.4 log CFU/g when fermentation&#xd;
was followed by drying. Drying to an MPR of 1.4:1 was no more effective than drying to an MPR of 1.9:1 (P . 0.05). When&#xd;
enumerated directly on selective media, Salmonella populations were reduced from 1.6 to 2.4 log CFU/g and from 3.6 to 4.5&#xd;
log CFU/g for fermentation alone and fermentation followed by drying, respectively. L. monocytogenes populations were&#xd;
reduced by ,1.0 log CFU/g following all fermentation and combined fermentation-drying treatments, regardless of the enumeration&#xd;
method. These results suggest that the Italian-style salami manufacturing process evaluated does not adequately&#xd;
reduce high pathogen loads. Processors may thus need to consider supplemental measures, such as raw material specifications&#xd;
and a final heating step, to enhance the lethality of the overall manufacturing process.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sliced (cut) and exterior (intact) surfaces of restructured cooked roast beef were inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes,&#xd;
treated with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC; immersion in 500 ml of 1% solution for 1 min), individually vacuum packaged,&#xd;
and stored for 42 days at 0 or 48C. Noninoculated samples were similarly treated, packaged, and stored to determine effects&#xd;
on quality (color and firmness) and on naturally occurring bacterial populations, including aerobic plate counts and lactic acid&#xd;
bacteria. Immediately after CPC treatment, regardless of inoculation level, L. monocytogenes populations were reduced (P = 0.05) by about 2 log CFU/cm2 on sliced surfaces and by about 4 log CFU/cm2 on exterior surfaces. Throughout 42 days of&#xd;
refrigerated storage (at both 0 and 48C), L. monocytogenes populations on CPC-treated samples remained lower (P = 0.05)&#xd;
than those of nontreated samples for both surface types. After 42 days of storage at both 0 and 48C, aerobic plate count and&#xd;
lactic acid bacteria populations of treated samples were 1 to 1.5 log CFU/cm2 lower (P = 0.05) than those of nontreated&#xd;
samples for both surface types. CPC treatment resulted in negligible effects (P > 0.05) on the color (L*, a*, and b* values)&#xd;
of exterior and sliced roast beef surfaces during storage. For both sliced and exterior surfaces, CPC-treated samples were&#xd;
generally less firm than nontreated samples. CPC treatment effectively reduced L. monocytogenes populations on roast beef&#xd;
surfaces and resulted in relatively minor impacts on color and texture attributes. CPC treatment, especially when applied to&#xd;
products prior to slicing, may serve as an effective antimicrobial intervention for ready-to-eat meat products.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Frankfurters inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes were treated with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or with 1%&#xd;
CPC followed by a water rinse at various combinations of spray temperatures (25, 40, and 558C), spray pressures (20, 25,&#xd;
and 35 psi), and times of exposure (30, 40, and 60 s). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed in the reductions&#xd;
achieved by 1% CPC + water wash and those achieved with 1% CPC treatment alone. L. monocytogenes populations were&#xd;
reduced by ca. 1.7 log CFU/g immediately following treatment, with no differences (P > 0.05) observed for different spray&#xd;
temperatures, pressures, or exposure times. The effectiveness of 1% CPC spray treatment (at 258C, 20 psi, and 30 s of exposure)&#xd;
against L. monocytogenes on vacuum-packaged frankfurters stored at 0 and 48C for 42 days was then evaluated. Application&#xd;
of a 1% CPC surface spray to frankfurters immediately prior to packaging reduced L. monocytogenes concentrations by 1.4&#xd;
to 1.7 log CFU/g and further restricted growth of the pathogen during 42 days of refrigerated storage, thereby meeting U.S.&#xd;
Department of Agriculture alternatives 1 and 2 criteria for Listeria control. CPC treatment reduced aerobic plate counts, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and molds, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli populations on noninoculated frankfurters to below detectable limits. The 1% CPC treatment did not affect the color (L*, a*, and b* values) of frankfurters stored for 42 days at 0 or 48C (P > 0.05). The effect of 1% CPC treatment on the firmness of frankfurters was also negligible.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A steam pasteurization process (patent pending) has been shown to effectively reduce pathogenic bacterial populations on beef tissue and to significantly reduce naturally occurring bacterial populations on commercially slaughtered beef carcasses. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the steam pasteurization treatment for reducing bacterial populations at several anatomical locations on commercially slaughtered carcasses. Before and after pasteurization treatment (82.2°C, 6.5-s exposure time), a sterile sponge was used to sample 300 cm2 at one of five locations (inside round, loin, midline, brisket, or neck). Eighty carcasses (40 before treatment and 40 after treatment) were sampled per anatomical location over 2 processing days. Before treatment, aerobic plate counts (APCs) were found to be highest (P ≤ 0.01) at the midline (4.5 log10 CFU/100 cm2), intermediate at the inside round, brisket, and neck (ca. 3.8 log10 CFU/100 cm2), and lowest at the loin (3.4 log10 CFU/100 cm2). After treatment, APCs at all locations were reduced significantly (P ≤ 0.01). The inside round, loin, and brisket had the lowest (P ≤ 0.01) APCs (ca. 2.6 log10 CFU/100 cm2), whereas the midline and neck had APCs of 3.1 and 3.3 log10 CFU/100 cm2, respectively. The lower reduction in APCs at the neck area indicated that the treatment may not be as effective there, possibly because of the design of the pasteurization equipment. Generic Escherichia coli populations were low at all locations before treatment, with populations on 32% of all carcasses sampled being less than the detection limit of the study (5.0 CFU/100 cm2). After treatment, E. coli populations were significantly lower (P ≤ 0.01) than populations before treatment and 85% of all carcasses sampled had E. coli populations below the detection limit. The maximum E. coli population detected after treatment was 25 CFU/100 cm2. For enteric bacterial populations, no differences were observed in the effectiveness of the treatment among the five carcass locations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effectiveness of a steam pasteurization process for reducing naturally occurring bacterial populations on freshly slaughtered beef sides was evaluated in a large commercial facility. Over a period of 10 days, 140 randomly chosen beef sides were microbiologically analyzed. Each side was sampled immediately before, immediately after, and 24 h after steam pasteurization treatment. Total aerobic bacteria (APC), Escherichia coli (generic), coliform, and Enterobacteriaceae populations were enumerated. The process significantly (P ≤ 0.01) reduced mean APCs from 2.19 log CFU/cm2 before treatment to 0.84 log CFU/cm2 immediately after and 0.94 log CFU/cm2 24 h after treatment. Before pasteurization (8 s steam exposure), 16.4% of carcasses were positive for generic E. coli (level of 0.60 to 1.53 log CFU/cm2), 37.9% were positive for coliforms (level of 0.60 to 2.26 log CFU/cm2), and 46.4% were positive for Enterobacteriaceae (level of 0.60 to 2.25 log CFU/cm2). After pasteurization, 0% of carcasses were positive for E. coli, 1.4% were positive for coliforms (level of 0.60 to 1.53 log CFU/cm2), and 2.9% were positive for Enterobacteriaceae (level of 0.60 to 1.99 log CFU/cm2). Of the 140 carcasses evaluated, one carcass was positive for Salmonella spp. before treatment (0.7% incidence rate); all carcasses were negative after steam treatment. This study indicates that steam pasteurization is very effective in a commercial setting for reducing overall bacterial populations on freshly slaughtered beef carcasses. The system may effectively serve as an important critical control point for HACCP systems at the slaughter phase of beef processing. In conjunction with other antimicrobial interventions (mandated by USDA to achieve zero tolerance standards for visible contamination) and good manufacturing practices, this process can play an important role in reducing the risk of pathogenic bacteria in raw meat and meat products.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The effectiveness of a recently invented "steam pasteurization" (S) process in reducing pathogenic bacterial populations on surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef was determined and compared with that of other standard commercial methods including knife trimming (T), water washing (35°C; W), hot water/steam vacuum spot cleaning (V), and spraying with 2% vol/vol lactic acid (54°C, pH 2.25; L). These decontamination treatments were tested individually and in combinations. Cutaneus trunci muscles from freshly slaughtered steers were inoculated with feces containing Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella typhimurium over a predesignated meat surface area, resulting in initial populations of ca. 5 log CFU/cm2 of each pathogen. Tissue samples were excised from each portion before and after decontamination treatments, and mean population reductions were determined. Treatment combinations evaluated were the following (treatment designations within the abbreviations indicate the order of application): TW, TWS, WS, VW, VWS, TWLS, and VWLS. These combinations resulted in reductions ranging from 3.5 to 5.3 log CFU/cm2 in all three pathogen populations. The TW, TWS, WS, TWLS, and VWLS combinations were equally effective (P > 0.05), resulting in reductions ranging from 4.2 to 5.3 log CFU/cm2. When used individually, T, V, and S resulted in pathogen reductions ranging from 2.5 to 3.7 log CFU/cm2 Steam pasteurization consistently provided numerically greater pathogen reductions than T or V. Treatments T, V, and S were all more effective than W (which gave a reduction on the order of 1.0 log CFU/cm2) Steam pasteurization is an effective method for reducing pathogenic bacterial populations on surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef, with multiple decontamination procedures providing greatest overall reductions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Food irradiation is one of the most important food processing methods utilized to reduce microbial load and extend shelf life.  In 1995 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared  irradiated foods to be safe from a nutritional and toxicological point of view.  Various methods have been applied to detect irradiated foods.  Detection of 2-alkylcyclobutanones has been found to be a useful method in identifying irradiated foods.  The solvent extraction method utilizes a Soxhlet apparatus for lipid extraction followed by clean up with Florisil.  However, this method is very time consuming.  The other methods available to detect 2-alkylcyclobutanone include supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and accelerated solvent extraction method using a Dionex ASE 200 instrument.  The SFE is a fast method to detected 2-alkylcyclobutanone.  All the above mentioned methods involve costly equipment.  The aim of this study was to eliminate the requirement of costly extraction equipment for lipid extraction before clean up or direct isolation of 2-alkylcyclobutanone as in case of SFE instrument using Florisil cartridges.  In this study, the manual solvent extraction method was applied to isolate alkylcylcobutanone followed by clean up with 2 g silica cartridge.  The clean up extract was injected to gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) for  detection of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB).  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to confirm that the compound detected was 2-dodecylcyclobutanone.  The ions m/z 98 and 112 were selected for 2-DCB for monitoring in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode of GC-MS.   The results showed that this method was able to detect 2-DCB from irradiated ground beef.  The manual method does not require costly equipment such as supercritical fluid extractor, Dionex, or Soxlet apparatus for extraction process.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy was used to determine protein secondary structure in hard wheat breeding lines in situ, providing a molecular means to rank endosperm hardness for the selection of wheat cultivars for a specific end-use.  Mapping with a single masked spot size diameter of 4.5 [Mu]m or confocal 5 [Mu]μm on beamlines U10B and U2B, respectively, produced spectra from the subaleurone layer within each wheat kernel using the high spatial resolution available with synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy.  This procedure was used for the first four crop years.  A focal plane array instrument was adapted for use for the remaining two crop years with a slight reduction of spatial resolution.  Deconvolution and curve fitting were applied to the amide I region of spectra selected from the interstitial protein between the starch granules, and the relative amount of [Alpha]-helix to other protein secondary structures was revealed.  Over six crop years, the [Alpha]-helix to [Beta]-sheet ratio of experimental wheat varieties were compared to those of released varieties in 143 mapping experiments.  The highest measurable value was 2.50 while the lowest was 1.11, a range consistent with hard wheat secondary structure determination found in previous studies (13, 16).  The determination of protein secondary structure provides a means of ranking experimental breeding lines for selection in specific end-use applications.  &#xd;
&#xd;
FT-IR microspectroscopic imaging was used to develop a method, using myoglobin as the model protein, to study the effects of thermal processing to 100 [degrees]C on protein secondary structure.  Films cast onto highly polished stainless steel plates allowed the study of the exact same film before and after heating.  Analyzing the shift in the amide I peak maxima of reflection absorption spectra for 280 pixels from myoglobin films revealed the depletion of [Alpha]-helix at the expense of other protein secondary structures.  Deconvolution and curve fitting techniques were applied to the amide I region of each spectral average to model protein secondary structure components found within the region.  The method developed was applied to another animal source, gelatin, and a plant source, wheat gluten.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Statistics published in 2003 indicate that over 67% of community college&#xd;
students are first-generation students, students from families where neither parent has&#xd;
graduated from college. First-generation students are disproportionately represented&#xd;
among those who terminate college prior to graduation. This study explores role theory&#xd;
as a model for understanding and addressing the problems of first-generation students.&#xd;
Survey questions linked to role commitment involving intentions to work,&#xd;
commute and participate in campus activities were administered to 257 first-time full-time&#xd;
students: 182 students were first-generation and 75 were non-first-generation.&#xd;
Analysis using the Mann-Whitney U Test indicated first-generation students had&#xd;
significantly less commitment to the role of student. Later, first-generation students&#xd;
were divided into "successful" and "unsuccessful" groups based on their two semester&#xd;
grade point average. The Mann-Whitney U Test failed to demonstrate a significant&#xd;
difference between "successful" and "unsuccessful" first-generation students. The&#xd;
ordinal score responses of first-generation students to the three survey questions were&#xd;
then used as categories and grade point averages of the students in those categories&#xd;
were compared using ANOVA procedures. The results were mixed but suggested&#xd;
further investigation was warranted.&#xd;
The study was concluded with interviews of ten "successful" first-generation&#xd;
students. The interview results were supportive of conclusions drawn from role theory&#xd;
underscoring the value of further studies with larger sample sizes and modifications in&#xd;
methodology suggested by this study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Diaphragmatic fatigue is known to limit endurance performance during heavy exercise in humans.  Previous reports have shown that diaphragmatic fatigue is reduced in rats with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a nonspecific antioxidant) infusion, suggesting that oxidative stress contributes to this fatigue.  However, it is not known if oral supplementation of NAC will reduce respiratory muscle fatigue during heavy exercise in humans.    Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an acute oral dose of NAC on respiratory muscle fatigue during whole body heavy exercise.  Eight healthy, non-smoking men (22+/-2 yrs), with no history of cardiovascular or lung disease, completed baseline pulmonary function tests followed by an incremental cycle VO[subscript 2peak] test.  A randomized, double blind crossover design was then used where subjects were given either placebo (PLA) or NAC (1800 mg) 45 min prior to a 30 minute constant load (85% VO[subscript 2peak]) discontinuous (six-five minute stages) or continuous (cycle until volitional exhaustion) exercise test.  Tests were separated by approximately one week.  Maximum pressures (inspiratory, PImax; expiratory, PEmax) and venous blood samples (plasma lactate and total plasma glutathione) were made prior to- and following each 5-min of exercise in discontinuous tests and pre- and post-exercise in continuous tests.  Subject's VO[subscript 2peak] was 43+/-5 ml/kg/min.  There was no difference (p>0.05) in PImax between NAC (127.9+/-34.1 cmH[subscript2]O) or PLA (134.1+/-28.1 cmH2O) at rest.  During exercise, PImax was significantly lower ([similar to]14%) in 6 of 8 subjects with PLA compared to NAC at minutes 25 and 30 of the discontinuous test indicating respiratory muscle fatigue.  With NAC, PImax did not change (p>0.05) from rest throughout exercise indicating no respiratory muscle fatigue.  There was no difference (p>0.05) in PEmax, plasma glutathione, lactate, oxygen uptake (VO[subscript 2]), ventilation (VE), heart rate (HR), or rating of perceived exertion between PLA and NAC at rest or during exercise.  Time to exhaustion was not different (p>0.05) during the continuous tests (PLA: 1263 + 334 sec; NAC: 1047 + 136 sec).  These results suggest that an acute dose of NAC reduces respiratory muscle fatigue during high intensity exercise but does not alter other ventilatory or metabolic indices.   The significance of this reduced respiratory muscle fatigue with NAC on whole body exercise performance remains to be determined.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The juxtaposition of a throw-away society with the realization that natural resources are threatened is a vivid illustration of the perplexing problem of contemporary lifestyle. As we consider the case of textile and apparel recycling it becomes apparent that the process impacts many entities and contributes significantly, in a broader sense, to the social responsibility of contemporary culture. By recycling, companies can realize larger profits because they avoid charges associated with dumping in landfills while at the same time recycling of textiles also contributes to goodwill associated with environmentalism, employment for marginally employable laborers, contributions to charities and disaster relief, and the movement of used clothing to areas of the world where clothing is needed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Because textiles are nearly 100% recyclable, nothing in the textile and apparel industry should be wasted. Harley Davidson jackets go to Japan, neckties go to Vietnam, raincoats go to London, cotton shirts go to Uganda, sleepwear goes to Belize, shoes go to Haiti, Levi's are coveted all over the world, and worn out promotional t-shirts are made into shoddy or wiping rags. In 2003, it was projected there would be a 3-5% increase in world fiber consumption which equals 2 million tons per year (http://bharattextile.com; Estur and Becerra, 2003). This presents a double-edged sword in that while at the same time it stimulates the economy (projected to add 10-20 new factories to meet the world market demand); it also gives rise to the increased problem of apparel and textile disposal.&#xd;
&#xd;
This paper provides a systems perspective that depicts the textiles recycling processes, particularly as it pertains to apparel. After that a micro-macro model using social systems theory will be presented. Finally, I will provide a synthesis of how systems theory provides a useful tool to project future trends for the textile and apparel recycling process. It is important to note that this work is based primarily on the processes as they are in the United States. My research is based on over five years of qualitative data collection on, primarily, apparel and other fashion products consumed throughout the United States and the world.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Research has traditionally focused on the development of symptoms in those who experienced trauma directly but has overlooked the impact of trauma on victims' families. In recent years, researchers and&#xd;
clinicians have begun to examine how individual exposure to traumatic events affects the spouses or partners, children, and professional helpers of trauma survivors. The current study examines qualitative interview data from 17 individuals, analyzed using a retroductive methodology to identify how intimate relationships are affected when there is a history of trauma exposure. The following primary themes were identified: increased communication, decreased communication, increased cohesion/connection, decreased &#xd;
cohesion/connection, increased understanding, decreased understanding, sexual intimacy problems, symptoms of relationship distress, support from partner, and relationship resources. Areas for future research and clinical implications are identified.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Jesuits presented evidence in both French and Chinese to defend Christianity by citation of legal and historical precedents in favor of the "Teaching of the Lord of Heaven" (Catholicism) even after the Yongzheng Emperor's 1724 imperial edict proscribed the religion as a heterodox cult. The Jesuits' strategy is traceable to Matteo Ricci's early missionary approach of accommodation to Chinese culture, which aimed to prove grounds for a Confucian-Christian synthesis based upon complementary points between Christian theology and their interpretation of Yuanru (Original Literati Teaching).   &#xd;
Their synthesis involved both written and oral rhetorical techniques that ranged from attempts to show compatibility between different religious values, to the manipulation of texts, and to outright deceit. Personal witness, observation, and interpretation played a key role in Jesuit group translation projects.  French and Chinese apologetic texts composed to prove grounds for the repeal of the 1724 proscription edict contain these approaches. The Lettres edifantes et curieuses ecrite par des missionnaires jesuites (1702-1776) contain examples of this approach, as well as the Ruijianlu (1735-1737).  Memorials in the Ruijianlu cited favorable legal precedents and imperial patronage rendered to Xiyangren (Men from the West). &#xd;
Jesuits presented their case for toleration of Christianity in the Ruijianlu in terms of Chinese notions of hospitality, diplomacy, and defense found in texts from as early as the Zhou dynasty. They cited an enduring Chinese defensive notion of "welcoming men from afar" (rouyuanren), but the court refused to return to this soft policy. The Qianlong Emperor rejected the Kangxi era policy of "welcoming men from afar" regarding established missions.   &#xd;
In 1735 the imperial Board of Punishments re-enforced the proscription order against Christianity in military units and also ruled that baptism of abandoned infants by a Chinese convert constituted religious heterodoxy based on the Qing Code (Article 162). The twenty-one Jesuits (not expelled in 1724) remained in imperial service and at liberty to practice their religion among themselves. Officials pursued a severe policy of punishing any cult deemed heterodox according to statutes of the Code. Persecution of Christians increased throughout the eighteenth century, but abated during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (1821-1851) when most anti-Christian edicts were rescinded and a subsequent imperial edict pardoned those Christians who practiced the faith for moral perfection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There have been considerable debates over the robust parameter design. As a result, there have been many approaches presented that are suited to the robust parameter design. In my report, I illustrate and present Taguchi's robust parameter design, response surface approach and semi-parameter design. &#xd;
Considerable attention has been placed on the semi-parameter design. This approach is new technology that was introduced to Picke, Robinson, Birch and Anderson-Cook (2006). The method is a combined parametric and nonparametric technique to improve the estimates of both the mean and the variance of the response.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Multilateral risk management and proactionary policy formulation&#xd;

<dc:description>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or commonly “mad cow disease,” is a zoonotic, neuropathological disorder classified among the prion diseases that, since its discovery and scientific characterization in the past few decades, has had profound implications on the food safety and security agenda for nations across the world.  Unfortunately, the majority of regulatory trade policies and practices most countries have prescribed in response to managing this disease has largely been unilateral and reactionary rather than mutually cooperative, international, and proactionary.  This situation afflicts tremendous economic and social costs on all interested parties, including the cattle industry and affiliated industries, consumers, governments on both local and national scales, and the medical and disease control communities.  Much of the past policy has been dictated by reactionary trade sanctions against BSE affected nations, issued indefinitely and at the discretion of individual nations.  This has resulted in the collapse of several national cattle export economies around the world that are, of late, only beginning to recuperate.  Indeed, what is needed is a frameshift in BSE management to one based on international cooperation and mutual application and enforcement of common policies for disease surveillance and control.  This paper describes the relevance of a multinational supply-chain regulation strategem applied to BSE management practices.  Such a strategem may facilitate the dual goals of economic security and food safety without compromise to either.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The study of how extrinsic factors affect the foraging efficiency and behavior of predaceous arthropods like Phytoseiulus persimilis is important to understand their various processes of acquiring prey, mates, refuges, oviposition sites, and overcoming obstacles posed by the environment. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect predator foraging efficiency and behavior. One of the most influential extrinsic factors may be the host plant on which herbivorous prey are found. Recent studies suggest that plant architecture plays an important role in tritrophic interactions. In this work, I studied the effects of cucumber plant architecture and prey distribution on the foraging efficiency (prey-finding time and prey-consumption rate) and behavior (time allocated between moving, resting and feeding) of P. persimilis. Plant architecture represented differences in leaf number and size; however, all plants had the same total surface area. Plants with 6 small leaves (ca. 82.98 square cm each) were considered as complex architecture, whereas plants with only 2 large leaves (ca. 240.60 square cm each) were considered as simple. The prey distributions were: prey patch on a single basal leaf (closest leaf to the soil) and prey patch on all leaves. The foraging efficiency was assessed by measuring prey-finding time and prey-consumption rate, whereas the behavior was assessed by conducting observational studies on specific foraging activities. When placed either on the top or at the base of the plant P. persimilis encountered prey more rapidly (interval 0-30 minute) on complex and simple plants with prey patches distributed on all leaves. Differences in prey density (number of prey per leaf) had no effect on the prey-finding time of P. persimilis. The predator consumed more eggs on complex plants with prey patches distributed on all leaves. Phytoseiulus perismilis tended to find prey patches more quickly as well as consume more eggs on leaves close to its release point. Furthermore, the predator was observed to lay more eggs on leaves where it had consumed higher number of prey eggs. The dimensions of individual parts of the plant e.g., stem, petiole and leaf, affected the time allocated by P. persimilis between searching, resting and feeding. The predatory mite spent more time foraging on the stems and petioles of the simple plants whereas on complex plants it spent more time foraging on the leaves.</dc:description>

<dc:title>An introduction to meta analysis</dc:title>

<dc:description>Meta analysis is a statistical technique for synthesizing of results obtained from multiple&#xd;
studies. It is the process of combining, summarizing, and reanalyzing previous quantitative&#xd;
research. It yields a quantitative summary of the pooled results.&#xd;
        Decisions of the validity of a hypothesis cannot be based on the results of a single study,&#xd;
because results typically vary from one study to the next. Traditional methods do not allow&#xd;
involving more than a few studies. Meta analysis provides certain procedures to synthesize data&#xd;
across studies. When the treatment effect (or effect size) is consistent from one study to the next,&#xd;
meta-analysis can be used to identify this common effect. When the effect varies from one study&#xd;
to the next, meta-analysis may be used to identify the reason for the variation.&#xd;
        The amount of accumulated information in fast developing fields of science such as&#xd;
biology, medicine, education, pharmacology, physics, etc. increased very quickly after the&#xd;
Second World War. This lead to large amounts of literature which was not systematized. One&#xd;
problem in education might include ten independent studies. All of the studies might be&#xd;
performed by different researchers, using different techniques, and different measurements. The idea of integrating the research literature was proposed by Glass (1976, 1977). He referred it as the meta analysis of research.&#xd;
        There are three major meta analysis approaches: combining significance levels,&#xd;
combining estimates of effect size for fixed effect size models and random effect size models,&#xd;
and vote-counting method.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Research traditionally has focused on the development of symptoms in those who experienced trauma directly but overlooked the impact of trauma on the families of victims. In recent years, researchers and clinicians have begun to examine how individual exposure to traumatic stress&#xd;
affects the spouses/partners, children, and professional helpers of trauma survivors. However, empirically supported, theory-based literature that identifies the mechanisms by which interpersonal or "secondary trauma" occurs in response to traumatic events is limited. Here, we&#xd;
present the Couple Adaptation to Traumatic Stress Model, a systemic model of the development of interpersonal symptoms in the couple dyad based on empirical literature. Potential mechanisms and clinical vignettes are included to describe the systemic processes that occur with trauma couples. Areas for future research and clinical implications also are identified.</dc:description>
