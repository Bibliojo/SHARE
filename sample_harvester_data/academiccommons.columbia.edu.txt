established oral tradition in Ireland, with versions documented throughout
the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The latest is a 1979
field recording of Derry folksinger and storyteller, Eddie Butcher (Shields
2011:58–9). The ballad was also assimilated into African–American oral
tradition, in which it was reconstructed and renamed “Stewball” (Lomax
1994:68–71; Scarborough 1925:61–4), and was still being documented
in American folk tradition as late as the 1930s (Flanders 1939:172–4). In
common with countless other folk songs, SB was appropriated by broadside
printers and subsequently enjoyed widespread public appeal throughout
England in the early– to mid–nineteenth century, its popularity waning
with the later decline of the broadside as a medium of ballad transmission
and distribution.
A comparative analysis of oral and broadside versions reveals clear
differences between the two narratives. I argue that these variations were
quite deliberate in origin, being a direct result of interpolations and excisions
made by broadside ballad printers to the original oral narrative. By
drawing comparisons between versions of SB collected from both oral and
broadside sources, this paper will demonstrate that as a consequence of
significant social and cultural advancements in the nineteenth century, SB
was deliberately revised with the aim of enhancing its appeal and relevance
to an increasingly literate middle class audience.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:180575</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T11:22:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Suspicious Silence: Walking Out on John Cage</dc:title><dc:creator>Lunberry, Clark</dc:creator><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>text</dc:type><dc:subject>Music</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8GQ6W9P</dc:identifier><dc:description>2012 marked what would have been the composer and

The Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Music shares in this problematic but raises its stakes, encouraging us to renew our attempts to think music philosophically. It accomplishes its primary goal admirably: it could very well accompany discussions of music and philosophy for some time to come. The articles it contains are for the most part emphatically if not explicitly written from the perspective of analytic philosophy, which suggests certain disciplinary alignments: music theory and cognition seem to align easily with analytic philosophy, whereas ethnomusicology and historical musicology seem to align with continental philosophy. One of the strengths of the Companion is its ability to appeal to readers from seemingly every music–academic discipline. The Companion thus provides a new standard of philosophical conversation toward which musicians can aspire.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:180590</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T11:30:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Troubadour Song as Performance: A Context for Guiraut Riquier’s “Pus sabers no’m val ni sens”</dc:title><dc:creator>Boynton, Susan Leslie</dc:creator><dc:date>2012</dc:date><dc:type>text</dc:type><dc:subject>Music</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8ZS2V2N</dc:identifier><dc:description>The songs of the troubadours present the fundamental challenge of understanding
poetry as music. Although the Old Occitan lyric corpus was a sung
tradition from its origins in the twelfth century, we do not know exactly
how it sounded; the poetry and musical notation of troubadour song are
only skeletal vestiges awaiting completion by the imagination. Miniature
biographies of the troubadours known as vidas, which combine elements
of fact and fiction, describe some poets as performers who sang and played
instruments, while others apparently did not. Most manuscript sources of
troubadour song lack musical notation; the few chansonniers that do include
it provide the pitches and text underlay for one strophe of melody, with the
remaining strophes of text laid out in prose format.
The absence of music from so much of the written transmission of the
corpus can be attributed to factors such as predominantly oral transmission
of the melodies (resulting in their loss as the tradition waned) and the
circumstances of compilation, which favored the presentation of the songs
as poems. The repertory travelled in the thirteenth century to northern
France, Italy, the Iberian peninsula and beyond through the movement
of poets, singers, patrons, and not least, the formation of the manuscript
tradition. As Marisa Galvez notes, the very concept of a troubadour corpus
as an authorial tradition emerged from the chansonniers. The constitution
of poetic personae in these manuscripts stands in for the construction of
poetic agency and voice that would have occurred in performance (2012:
59–64). Many nonmusical, nonverbal components of performance that
are now irrecoverable were as much part of the song as the melody and
text, and were probably embedded in its early reception: the performers’
appearance and gestures, their relationship to the audience, their present
or absent patrons.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:180593</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T11:34:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Validation and Calibration of a Model Used to Reconstruct Historical Exposure to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Use in Epidemiologic Studies</dc:title><dc:creator>Beyea, Jan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hatch, Maureen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Stellman, Steven D.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Santella, Regina M.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Teitelbaum, Susan L.</dc:creator><dc:creator>Prokopczyk, Bogdan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Carmann, David</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gammon, Marilie D.</dc:creator><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>text</dc:type><dc:subject>Environmental studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oncology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Epidemiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Public health</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8Q81BMW</dc:identifier><dc:description>Objectives;

We previously developed a historical reconstruction model to estimate exposure to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from traffic back to 1960 for use in case–control studies of breast cancer risk. Here we report the results of four exercises to validate and calibrate the model.

Methods;

Model predictions of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) concentration in soil and carpet dust were tested against measurements collected at subjects’ homes at interview. In addition, predictions of air intake of BaP were compared with blood PAH–DNA adducts. These same soil, carpet, and blood measurements were used for model optimization. In a separate test of the meteorological dispersion part of the model, predictions of hourly concentrations of carbon monoxide from traffic were compared with data collected at a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency monitoring station.

Results;

The data for soil, PAH–DNA adducts, and carbon monoxide concentrations were all consistent with model predictions. The carpet dust data were inconsistent, suggesting possible spatial confounding with PAH-containing contamination tracked in from outdoors or unmodeled cooking sources. BaP was found proportional to other PAHs in our soil and dust data, making it reasonable to use BaP historical data as a surrogate for other PAHs. Road intersections contributed 40–80% of both total emissions and average exposures, suggesting that the repertoire of simple markers of exposure, such as traffic counts and/or distance to nearest road, needs to be expanded to include distance to nearest intersection</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:180601</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T11:40:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Review of Wayne D.

educator at some point in their career. As Luis Alfonso Estrada Rodgriquez
writes, “[m]any musicians devote time in their lives in one way or another
to teaching. This is, however, an activity that in many cases was not taken
into account in their studies” (240). In particular, music theorists and
musicologists often serve as instructors in higher education and, therefore,
devote many hours to the pedagogy of music. The Oxford Handbook of
Philosophy in Music Education, edited by Wayne Bowman and Ana Lucía
Frega—a collection of writings from leading, contemporary music education
philosophers—provides a useful resource for those academics of music
that find themselves in this common position. In this review, first I briefly
provide the historical progression of music education philosophy over the
last forty years in order to situate the ideas and themes for readers outside
the field of music education. Second, I highlight some important themes
within the book, focusing on connections among the chapters rather than
addressing them separately. Third, I suggest how academics outside of the
field of education may apply it to higher education. Finally, I remark on the
connection between theory and practice in this text and music education
scholarship and look to the future.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:177748</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T11:47:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>World Science U</dc:title><dc:creator>Greene, Brian</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dreifus, Claudia</dc:creator><dc:creator>Matiz, A.

Brian Greene is a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, and is widely recognized for a number of groundbreaking discoveries in superstring theory, including the co-discoveries of mirror symmetry and topology change. His first book for general audiences, The Elegant Universe, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and has sold more than a million copies worldwide. His more recent books, The Fabric of the Cosmos and The Hidden Reality, were both New York Times bestsellers, and inspired the Washington Post to call him "the single best explainer of abstruse concepts in the world today." Greene's latest project, World Science U, brings science education online with innovative digital courses available to anyone with an interest in science. Greene makes frequent media appearances on programs such as Charlie Rose, The Colbert Report and David Letterman. He has hosted two NOVA specials, based on The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos, which were nominated for four Emmy Awards and won a George Foster Peabody Award. Professor Greene is co-director of Columbia's Institute for Strings, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics, and with producer Tracy Day, he is co-founder of the World Science Festival. Claudia Dreifus, a journalist and adjunct professor at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, is well known for her interviews in the New York Times with leading figures in world politics and science.

This has precipitated the penetration of optical interconnects to smaller, more localized scales, in such applications as data centers, supercomputers, and access networks. For this next generation of optical interconnects, the silicon photonic platform has received wide attention for its ability to manifest, more economical, high-performance photonics. The high index contrast and CMOS compatibility of the silicon platform give the potential to intimately integrate small footprint, power-efficient, high-bandwidth photonic interconnects with existing high-performance CMOS microelectronics. 
      Within the silicon photonic platform, traditional photonic elements can be manifested with smaller footprint and higher energy-efficiency. Additionally, the high index contrast allows the successful implementation of silicon microring-based devices, which push the limits on achievable footprint and energy-efficiency metrics. While laboratory demonstrations have testified to their capabilities as powerful modulators, switches, and filters, the commercial implementation of microring-based devices is impeded by their susceptibility to fabrication tolerances and their inherent temperature sensitivity. 
      This work develops and demonstrates methods to resolve the aforementioned sensitivities of microring-based devices. Specifically, the use of integrated heaters to thermally tune and lock microring resonators to laser wavelengths, and the underlying control systems to enable such functionality. 
      The first developed method utilizes power monitoring to show the successful thermal stabilization of a microring modulator under conditions that would normally render it inoperational. In a later demonstration, the photodetector used for power monitoring is co-integrated with the microring modulator, again demonstrating thermal stabilization of a microring modulator and validating the use of defect-enhanced silicon photodiodes for on-chip control systems. 
      Secondly, a generalized method is developed that uses dithering signals to generate anti-symmetric error signals for use in stabilizing microring resonators. A control system utilizing a dithering signal is shown to successfully wavelength lock and thermally stabilize a microring resonator. Characterizations are performed on the robustness and speed of the wavelength locking process when using dithering signals. An FPGA implementation of the control system is used to scale to a WDM microring demultiplexer, demonstrating the simultaneous wavelength locking of multiple microring resonators. Additionally, the dithering technique is adopted to create control systems for microring-based switches, which have traditionally posed a challenging problem due to their multi-state configurations. 
      The aforementioned control systems are rigorously tested for applications with high speed data and analyzed for power efficiency and scalability to show that they can successfully scale to commercial implementations and be the enabling factor in the commercial deployment of microring-based devices.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:178194</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T12:13:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Sound in the Construction of Race: From Blackface to Blacksound in Nineteenth-Century America</dc:title><dc:creator>Morrison, Matthew D.</dc:creator><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>text</dc:type><dc:subject>Music</dc:subject><dc:subject>American studies</dc:subject><dc:subject>African American studies</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8DV1HFS</dc:identifier><dc:description>This dissertation examines sound, and its embodied articulation through music and movement, as I consider pivotal ways in which race has been constructed through the history of blackface minstrelsy in the United States. I contend that the racialized sounds developed out of early blackface performance have both persisted and shifted throughout the history of American popular music, even after the disappearance of the blackface mask. I have neologized the concept of Blacksound to denote the racially coded sonic scripts that have developed out of the history of blackface performance. Blacksound refers to the histories and movements of the African American bodies, both real and imagined, on which its performance is based. The concept also suggests the scripting, manipulation, and absorption of these sonic performances by both black and non-black bodies as vehicles for imagining and self-expression, understood in relation to how ideals of citizenship vis-a-vis whiteness developed along the emerging color line throughout the long nineteenth century. Because Blacksound emerges out of the contexts of chattel slavery and minstrelsy, its commodified nature is always central to understanding how it sonically functions within the construction of identity in U.S. history. I examine how the masked receding of the sonic and corporeal tropes of blackface into Blacksound became the basis of contemporary popular sound and central to constructions of civic and racial identity in the United States. This approach is primarily developed through a comparative analysis of sheet music, imagery, and primary and secondary accounts of blackface performance rituals throughout the long nineteenth century.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:178210</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T12:14:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Music, Affect, Labor, and Value: Late Capitalism and the (Mis)Productions of Indie Music in Chile and Brazil</dc:title><dc:creator>Garland, Shannon</dc:creator><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>text</dc:type><dc:subject>Cultural anthropology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Music</dc:subject><dc:subject>Latin American studies</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8WS8RSG</dc:identifier><dc:description>This dissertation traces the tensions surrounding indie music production in Santiago, Chile and Sao Paulo, Brazil. I conducted several years of ethnographic research on locally situated, yet transnationally interpolated, musical production, circulation and listening practices in Santiago and Sao Paulo. I open by detailing the expansion of the indie touring market from the global north into both cities, theorizing the enlistment of affect as a neoliberal technique for producing monetary value. The next chapter considers spaces for musical association as forms of infrastructure that both emerge from and themselves help constitute musical-social networks in Santiago. I follow by showing how the history of Brazilian individuals' engagement with particular sets of indie sounds from the global north bear upon the contemporary formation of infrastructures of social relations, musical aesthetics, and places for musical and social association. Finally, I detail how the tensions between the construction of audience, value, aesthetics and circulation arising from new production structures manifest in the politics of a new type of Brazilian institution called Fora do Eixo. Here, I inspect the logics of aesthetic valuation in building structures for music production within a complex state-private nexus of cultural funding in Brazil. As a whole, this dissertation explores the political struggles emerging as actors seek to establish new structures for participating in live shows and for playing music as both a creative practice and as an economic activity within emerging forms of communication and cultural circulation made possible by digital media. Each struggle is simultaneously interpolated by the messy articulation of transnationally-produced notions of aesthetics, authentic modes of engagement with music, and moral-ethical ways of organizing music production, circulation and remuneration as a social practice. The dissertation thus highlights the way new media and economic logics build upon and clash with historical practices of production, evaluation of aesthetics, and regimes for mediating the artistic, the economic, and the social.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:177760</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T12:14:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Reinventing Education</dc:title><dc:creator>Agarwal, Anant</dc:creator><dc:date>2014</dc:date><dc:type>moving image</dc:type><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8N878CK</dc:identifier><dc:description>Anant Agarwal presents "Reinventing Education."

It has been proposed that this shift is due to the increased use of filter and lower-tar cigarettes, resulting in increased delivery of smoke to peripheral regions of the lungs, where adenocarcinoma usually occurs. We reviewed radiologic data to evaluate the hypothesis that tumors in smokers of cigarettes with lower-tar yield are more likely to occur peripherally than tumors in smokers of higher-yield cigarettes.

Methods: At two urban academic medical centers, we reviewed computed tomographic scans, chest radiographs, and medical records to assign tumor location (peripheral or central) for 330 smokers diagnosed with carcinoma of the lung between 1993 and 1999. We compared the proportion of tumors in a peripheral versus central location by lifetime filter use and average lifetime tar rating (&lt;21 and ≥21 mg).

Results: Tumor location (69% peripheral and 31% central) was unrelated to cigarette filter use. Smokers of cigarettes with lower-tar ratings were more likely than those with higher ratings to have peripheral rather than central tumors (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-3.47). When restricted to subjects with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 2.31 (1.05-5.08).

Conclusions: Among cigarette smokers with lung cancer, use of cigarettes with lower-tar yield was associated with preferential occurrence of tumors in peripheral sites. Our findings support the hypothesis that changes in smoking associated with lower-tar cigarettes have led to a shift in the location of smoking-related lung cancer.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>academiccommons.columbia.edu/ac:177765</identifier><datestamp>2014-10-01T12:51:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>The Future of Digital Learning in Higher Education</dc:title><dc:creator>Dede, Chris</dc:creator><dc:date>2013</dc:date><dc:type>moving image</dc:type><dc:subject>Education</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8VT1QNN</dc:identifier><dc:description>Chris Dede, Timothy E.

The film follows an old man, a goat, a tree, and a piece of charcoal, successfully creating spectator identification beyond the human realm. The film raises the stakes for how we interact as individuals with the material world by showing the existence of the animals and minerals that are hardly ever given a voice in media. The idea for the film stems from the Ovidean (and Pythagorean) conception of the interchangeable relation between humans and animals, showing the transference of the soul through the technique of montage. Frammartino starts with a base in Greek philosophy and the Italian traditional ways of life in order to question the post-human in the contemporary era and to present a truly universal film transcending language, time, and species. The political implications of these filmic aspects are explored through the theories of Cesare Zavattini, Paul Schrader, and André Bazin. By aesthetically and narratively decentralizing humans, Frammartino reveals Being and makes the invisible visible on the screen. This essay will use a phenomenological lens to uncover the transcendental aspects of Le quattro volte, analysing how Frammartino uses film language to convey a Pythagorean posthumanism to present the unseen world.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2014-10-01T00:00:00Z).u(2014-10-02T00:00:00Z):25</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
