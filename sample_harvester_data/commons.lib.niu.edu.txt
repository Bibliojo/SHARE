<dc:title>Factor demand and substitution in the United States' state and local government sector: A translog cost approach.</dc:title>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the degree of factor substitution and factor demands in the aggregate state and local government sector. A three-input, one-output translog cost model was used to obtain estimates of Allen partial elasticities of substitution and own-price elasticities of demand for the factors. The three inputs consisted of structures, equipment and labor. The output was aggregate government services provided by state and local governments.This study is significant because of the magnitude of the state and local government sector in the United States. The ratio of state and local government employees to employees in the manufacturing sector in 1983 was.71; and as of 1985, state and local governments owned 1.68 times as much structures and equipment as did the entire manufacturing sector. Understanding factor demand and substitution in the state and local government sector is therefore a very important element in understanding the economy as a whole.The results of the study show that structures and equipment are strong substitutes. Equipment and labor are relatively weak substitutes. Structures and labor are neither substitutes nor complements. The price elasticity of demand for equipment is very close to unity. The price elasticities of demand for structures and labor are very inelastic.These results were evaluated against the backdrop of published empirical research on factor substitution and demand. Almost all of the empirical work has been devoted to the private manufacturing and industrial sector of national economies. The results of the numerous studies show wide variations in reported elasticities of factor substitution. Some support for the findings of this present study can be found in the published literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate one aspect of audiovisuals in the lives of young children. The central question addressed in this study was: How do audiovisuals compare to the story hour approach in encouraging young children's interest in books? This question was broken down into the following sub-questions. (1) Does the presentation of a book produced either as a slidetape program, or a television program, or in a story hour, affect the interest of three- and four-year-old children in total books available to them within the research setting, as measured by their spontaneously taking books from their shelves and looking at them or requesting that they be read to them? (2) Does the presentation of a book produced as a slide-tape program, television program, or in a story hour, affect the interest of three- and four-year-old children in the specific book produced and presented, as measured by the criterion given in number "1" above? (3) Does the presentation of a book produced as a slide-tape program, television program, or in a story hour, affect the interest of three- and four-year-old children in books other than the specific book produced and presented?Using an experimental design, the three treatments, slide-tape, television (videotape), and story hour were randomly assigned to three groups of three- and four-year-old children enrolled in the Early Childhood Research Laboratory at Northern Illinois University, Department of Curriculum and Instruction, College of Education. A fourth group was used as a control and received no treatment. Each group was comprised of ten children.A time sampling checklist was designed on which was recorded the children's use of books. Book use was divided into three categories: use of the presented book, use of other books, and the combined use of total available books.Data were gathered for the study over an eight-month period. Data were collected two days per week, 25 minutes per day over a four-week period for each group. For the three experimental groups, the treatment intervened between the second and third day of data recording. The study was approved as "not at risk" to the children by the review committee for use of human subjects in research.The raw data on the checksheets were converted to means of book usage for each group for each day. Mean book usage was computed in three categories, use of total books available in the research setting, use of the book used in the three treatments, use of books other than the treatment book. The means of the four groups were compared using an analysis of variance. Significance of these analyses was established at the .05 level at minimum. Means were compared for the four groups for the two pretests and for each of the six posttests, and of the sum of the posttests.The findings of the study indicated there were no significant differences in the means of the sums of the posttests of the three experimental groups in any of the three categories of book use:  (1) total books available, (2) the presented book, or (3) other books.The research findings of this study do not warrant the rejection of any of the null hypotheses. The conclusion is: there is no significant difference in the interest of three- and four-year-old children in books whether or not they are presented with a story hour, television or slide-tape production. No treatment had a significant effect.</dc:description>

<dc:title>PSI TRAINING THROUGH MEDITATION, AND SELF-ACTUALIZATION AS RELATED TO PSI PERFORMANCE.</dc:title>

<dc:description>The problem investigated in this study was whether or not extrasensory perception (ESP) and self-actualization could be positively enhanced through specific mediation techniques. Additional questions examined whether or not ESP and self-actualization were positively related in subjects prior to treatment and after treatment, and whether positive change in self-actualization was related to positive change in ESP ability.A total of 28 subjects were randomly distributed into experimental and control groups. Pretests and posttests for ESP and for self-actualization were administered by means of an ESP measure developed for this study, and the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) as a measure of self-actualization. The experimental group received three 3-hour sessions of meditation training spread over three weeks. The meditation training program included specific didactic information and techniques which, based on a review of the pertinent parapsychological literature, were expected to comprise a meaningful and effective method of fostering ESP success as well as a more self-actualized personality. At the end of the experimental treatment, both experimental and control groups had posttest measures administered to them in the same form as at pretesting.Data were collected and subjected to statistical analyses as follows: The data were treated both as continuous and as categorical in consideration of researchers' differing preference for one or the other type of analysis, and in order to elicit any significant relationship which may not have been disclosed by another type of analysis.Data were first considered as continuous for both ESP and self-actualization and examined by means of analysis of covariance and Pearson correlation. Data were then considered as continuous for self-actualization and as categorical for ESP, and examined by means of analysis of variance. Data were finally considered as categorical for both ESP and self-actualization and examined by crosstabulation through the binomial and the binomial alternative to the McNemar test. Research hypotheses were tested at the .10 level of significance.Results indicated that the meditation training group as designed was effective in significantly increasing level of self-actualization in subjects as measured by the POI. It remains uncertain as to whether or not the mediation training program is effective in facilitating ESP performance although experimental group scores increased while control group scores did not. Self-actualization was positively related to level of ESP prior to any treatment but not after treatment in the experimental group. Finally, it remains uncertain as to whether or not positive change in self-actualization is related to positive change in ESP.The study's results support the findings of previous research into ESP, ESP training, and their relationship to personality characteristics such as self-actualization. Such earlier findings are not frequently significant, and often contradictory. More sophisticated means of measuring extrasensory skills is indicated, as is the application of the meditation training program to a population such as counselors or counselor candidates in an effort to increase and/or assess their potential for gaining knowledge through extrasensory channels.With regard to self-actualization, both researchers and practitioners alike maintain the importance of expanded awareness and heightened consciousness in moving persons beyond mere adjustment to true psychological health. Since level of self-actualization which is highly related to heightened consciousness can be increased through specific meditation techniques, it is likely that the counseling profession could benefit from such techniques. The more self-actualized counselor would likely be more in touch with his or her own level of psychological functioning and therefore more aware of and sensitive to that of the client.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Burke's "Letters on a Regicide Peace": Fanaticism and the transformation of international politics.</dc:title>

<dc:description>Through an examination of Burke's writings on the French Revolutionary Wars, especially his Letters on a Regicide Peace, this study will evaluate Burke's views on the transformation of the nature of international politics which resulted from the birth of ideological conflict during the Wars of the French Revolution. For the two hundred years prior to the French Revolution, European wars were of limited scope and means, based as they were upon conflicts of interest or passion between European statesmen. But the ideological warfare unleashed by the French Revolutionary Wars was a new kind of warfare--warfare based upon opinion with universalistic fanatical proselytization as its end. This new kind of warfare knew no inherent bounds.This study will argue that Burke thought that the primary cause of modern ideological or fanatical politics was the metaphysical character of modern philosophy. Modern metaphysical politics was oblivious to the costs in human suffering which the implementation of its goals required. As a result, any sacrifice could be justified as long as the desired revolutionary political transformation was achieved.It is my hope that by increasing our understanding of the genesis of ideological politics or fanaticism through an analysis of the writings of Burke, who was the first to systematically examine this process in the arena of international politics, this study will contribute to our comprehension of the nature of fanaticism or ideological politics as a force in international relations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes of selected Illinois community college occupational students and program advisory committee members toward the objectives of general education. The study attempted to identify specific objectives of general education and to investigate the degree of importance ascribed to those objectives in occupational curricula by the students and advisory members.Specifically, this study examined the differences in the perception toward the relative importance of the objectives of general education between all occupational students and all program advisory committee members and between students and advisory members in each of five occupational clusters. This study also investigated differences in the perception toward the relative importance of the objectives of general education among occupational students in the five occupational clusters and among the advisory committee members in the five occupational clusters.Significant differences were observed in the perceived importance of some objectives of general education between occupational students and advisory committee members. These differences varied among the five occupational clusters. Significant differences were also observed in perceived importance among advisory committee members and among students in the five occupational clusters. No significant differences were observed in the order in which the 20 general education objectives were ranked utilizing mean response scores by occupational students and program advisory committee members.Of the 20 objectives, both occupational students and advisory committee members ranked the relative importance of Creation of Knowledge, Problem Solving, Communication of Knowledge, Desire for Knowledge, and Technical Foundation as the five most important objectives. Both groups ranked the relative importance of Place in Physical World, Personal Culture, Home and Family, World Membership, and Knowledge of Cultural Heritage among the six least important objectives.Advisory committee members perceived three of those objectives ranked highest as being significantly more important than did students. Those objectives were Creation of Knowledge, Problem Solving, and Technical Foundation. All five objectives ranked among the least important objectives were perceived by the advisory committee members as being significantly less important than did the students.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study drew upon information contributed in previous studies to systematically investigate the effects of cognitive abilities, statement voice, and question voice upon primary school age children's abilities to give correct responses to questions. The main investigation of the study was concerned with the possibility that an interaction of cognitive abilities, statement voice, and question voice might affect children's abilities to respond correctly. In addition to the possible interactions, the main effects of the three variables were examined. The examination of the main effects was similar to the procedures utilized in previous studies. Unlike previous studies, interactions between all three variables were also examined.Measures of cognitive abilities (Concept Assessment Kit-Conservation, Form A) and of correct responses to questions about statements were taken for 97 children. Cognitive ability was classified as conserver, transitional and nonconserver as proposed by Borucki (1976). The conditions of measured receptive language ability were:  (1) active voice statement-active voice question, (2) active voice statement-passive voice question, (3) passive voice statement-active voice question, and (4) passive voice statement-passive voice question.The analysis of the data in this study revealed main effects confirmed in previous studies regarding cognitive ability, statement voice, and question voice, but this support did not hold in the analysis of interaction. Cognitive abilities were related to the overall correct responses, but did not interact significantly with statement voice and/or question voice. Correct responses for active voice statements were higher than for passive voice statements for both active and passive voice questions, but became lower at the passive voice question level. As a main effect, question voice was not significant. There was a disordinal interaction of question voice through statement voice. The investigation revealed a significant hierarchy of difficulty within the four conditions of statement and question voice forms. The order of difficulty was:  (1) active voice statement-active voice question pairs, (2) active voice statement-passive voice question pairs, (3) passive voice statement-passive voice question pairs, and (4) passive voice statement-active voice question pairs.The present study was based upon the premise that a twofold comprehension task underlies children's responses to questions. To respond to a question about information that has been presented, the children must first comprehend the information and then the question. It seemed reasonable to expect that cognitive and/or language development factors which have been found to influence children's comprehension of statement voice forms might also influence children's abilities to respond to question voice forms. The present study indicated that primary school age children may be inadvertently restricted in their abilities to demonstrate comprehension when a questioning process is utilized. The present study confirmed a need for better understanding of primary school age children's receptive language abilities in relation to their cognitive abilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between WISC Verbal-Performance categories and reading achievement among Black, urban school children. The WISC and the Wide Range Achievement Test were administered to 224 inner city students, as part of psychological evaluations completed by the author as a school psychologist. All of the students had been referred by their teachers and principals because of various educational or behavioral difficulties. The subjects included in the study were 8, 10, or 12 years of age and had WISC Full Scale IQ scores of between 90 and 110, inclusive.Using the results of the WISC administrations, the subjects were assigned to one of three groups, according to their WISC Verbal-Performance IQ scores. The first category, Low Verbal-High Performance (Group I), was made up of those subjects whose WISC Verbal Scale was at least 10 points below their Performance IQ score. The second category, equal Verbal-Performance (Group II), was comprised of those subjects whose Verbal and Performance IQ scores were less than 5 points apart. The third category, High Verbal-Low Performance (Group III), included those subjects whose Verbal IQ was at least 10 points above that of their Performance IQ. The dependent variable of reading achievement was determined from the reading scores of the Wide Range Achievement Test. The mean reading score of each IQ group, at each age level, was separated by sex.A statistical analysis of the results included a 3 x 3 x 2 analysis of variance. A significant (p at .05) three-way interaction was found for the variables of age, IQ group, and sex, which superseded the significance of the main effects and two-way interactions found. t-tests were performed to isolate where this three-way interaction difference occurred. The statistical findings indicated that, at the different age levels, the pattern of mean reading scores for males and females in the various IQ groups was not consistent. However, inspection of the results indicated that for ages 10 and 12 only, Group I subjects were significantly lower than Group II and Group III in reading achievement, regardless of sex. It was therefore concluded that for ages 10 and 12, WISC Verbal-Performance category is significantly related to reading achievement, with Group I configuration being a likely indicator of reading underachievement.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to confirm and extend previous research that has related information-processing speed to performance on complex tasks, and (b) to clarify this relationship with regard to differences in gender and level of anxiety.The subjects of this ex post facto study were 248 undergraduates including 123 males and 125 females. These subjects completed the Test Anxiety Inventory and performed a memory-scanning task on a microcomputer. Students' ACT scores were utilized as the measure of complex task performance. Data were analyzed using correlation, step-wise regression, and analysis of variance techniques.Significant negative correlations were found between the ACT composite score and the intercept, mean response time, and standard deviation of the response times on the memory-scanning task. In general, the pattern of correlations was similar for males and females. Partialling out anxiety did not reduce these correlations, and so a motivational explanation for these relationships was not supported.Step-wise regression analyses revealed that 16.9% of the variance in ACT scores could be accounted for by a combination of gender, anxiety, and memory-scanning parameters. For females, significant predictors of the ACT were anxiety and the standard deviation of the response times. For males, the mean response time and anxiety were significant predictors. An analysis of variance indicated that handedness was not a factor in response time speed, nor did handedness interact with the presence or absence of the probe.The need to study the role of additional variables that may affect the relationship between information-processing parameters and complex-task performance was identified. Future investigations should assess the importance of other personality variables, attentional factors, and subject's attitudes and feelings of competence when working on a computerized task. In addition, the possibility of increasing complex task performance by reducing memory-scanning time through training was suggested. A recommendation was also made to include information-processing tasks in conjunction with the more traditional psychometric measures when predicting academic success.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the dissertation research was to identify the effects of inflation upon the taxation of income and capital within the nonfinancial corporate sector. A partial equilibrium approach was used to address two areas:  (1) to identify the magnitude and variation of the effects of inflation upon the taxation of corporate income and capital, given the existing nominal income tax system, and (2) to identify the effects of using a price-level-adjusted taxable income measure upon the aggregate magnitude and distribution of corporate income tax payments.The study used financial statement data from the annual industrial COMPUSTAT tapes. A subset of 864 nonfinancial corporations was selected for the study within 26 two-digit standard industry classifications. An algorithm was developed to perform the following:  (1) to estimate taxable income, (2) to estimate price-level-adjusted pre-tax income and price-level-adjusted taxable income, and (3) to estimate the tax payments based upon historical cost taxable income and price-level-adjusted taxable income. Real and nominal tax rates were computed for each firm and capital maintenance conditions were used to determine the incidence of capital erosion and the degree of capital maintenance within each industry group. The analysis was cross-sectional and encompassed the years 1976, 1977 and 1978.The results indicate that the real tax rate was significantly greater than the nominal tax rate for most firms and industries in the study. The exceptions to this general finding were explained by using a form of sensitivity analysis. The results also indicate that there was a substantial variation in the real tax rate among firms and industry groups. In addition, it was found that the use of a price-level-adjusted taxable income measure would alter the magnitude and the distribution of tax payments within the corporate sector.It was concluded that the effects of inflation upon corporate income taxation have resulted in intersectoral and intrasectoral misallocations of capital. In particular, the most obvious economic effect of the increase in the real corporate tax rate is a reduction in the rate of corporate capital formation. Moreover, the substantial variation of the real tax rate implies a source of capital misallocation within the corporate sector. It was also concluded that the use of a price-level-adjusted taxable income measure would result in some serious problems for income tax policy formulation. In particular, the policy change would result in a reduction in the tax revenue obtained from the corporate sector. In addition, the policy change would cause a shifting of tax payments among firms and industries.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether variant student names would have an influence upon the (1) grades, (2) number of mechanical errors, (3) number of content errors, (4) number of miscellaneous positive comments, or (5) number of miscellaneous negative comments which community college English instructors would mark on a student essay.During the Spring Semester of 1979, 404 community college English instructors were mailed an identical essay whereon only the ascribed student name varied. Of these 404, 246 instructors returned usable test instruments. This represented a response rate of 60.9 percent.Thirty instructors marked an essay ascribed to the first name Daniel; 30, Frederick; 31, George; and 34, James. Another group of 30 instructors marked an essay ascribed to Buschbacher; 32, Etheredge; 31, Kronowski; and 28, Mendez.The letter grades were converted to a numerical scale (from 0 = F through 12 = A+) for computational purposes. Counts were made of the number of marked mechanical errors, content errors, miscellaneous positive comments, and miscellaneous negative comments. Ten separate analyses of variance were performed to determine the degree of relationship between the ascribed names and the dependent measures.No statistically significant relationship was found between first names and grades, mechanical errors, content errors, and miscellaneous positive comments. Nor was any relationship found between surnames and grades, mechanical errors, content errors, and miscellaneous negative comments.A statistically significant relationship was found between first names and miscellaneous negative comments. The post hoc Scheffe test was performed. The test data indicated that the essay ascribed to George received the highest mean number of miscellaneous negative comments while the essay ascribed to Daniel received the lowest mean number of miscellaneous negative comments.A statistically significant relationship was also found between surnames and miscellaneous positive comments. The post hoc Scheffe test data indicated that the essay ascribed to Mendez received the highest mean number of miscellaneous positive comments, followed in order by Etheredge, Buschbacher, and Kronowski.On the basis of these findings, two conclusions were offered. Community college English instructors were not influenced by variant first names or surnames in "professional" marks, i.e., grades, mechanical errors, and content errors. However, community college English instructors may have been partially subject to the influences of variant first names and surnames in "non-professional" marks, i.e., miscellaneous negative and positive comments.These findings and conclusions were not consistent with earlier studies. The influences of name stereotypes in this study appeared to be more subtle than found in earlier studies. This study was inconclusive in isolating the source of personal name stereotypes. The question of whether name stereotypes are derived from social stereotypes or from a "kernel of truth" remained.</dc:description>

Its objective is to examine the intrinsic conflict between the legislative and executive branches through their interactions over the proper scope and character of United States export controls policy since World War II.In this study, four models of likely export controls policies are developed: denial, leverage, incentive, and differentiation. These models are then compared to the statutory and regulatory bases of United States export controls policy over time (the Export Control Act of 1949 and the Export Administration Acts of 1969 and 1979, and the Export Administration Regulations of 1977 and 1980, respectively).The insights gained from these comparisons are then applied to an analysis of the Cyber 76 export licensing case, which involved the proposed transfer of advanced American computer technology to the Soviet Union. The actual disposition of this case, under the authority of the Export Administration Act of 1969 and the Export Administration Regulations of 1977, is compared to a hypothetical disposition under the authority of the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Export Administration Regulations of 1980.The major conclusion is that the root cause of legislative-executive conflict in foreign policy decision-making with respect to United States export controls policy is the legislature's insistence on relatively consistent and inclusive frameworks for the conduct of public policy, as opposed to the executive's demand for latitude and discretion in responding to the exigencies which often determine the success or failure of such policy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated the career patterns of presidents of public post-secondary institutions within the continental United States. The specific purpose of this study was to determine if there was a relationship between the type of institution served and selected attributes of the president. Resumes of the presidents were studied to determine if there were any significant differences in the community college, senior college, or university presidents' career patterns. The career patterns were compared on the basis of the presidents' academic preparation, professional background and personal characteristics.The sample for the study was drawn from a comprehensive list of public and private higher education institutions compiled in the Education Directory, Colleges and Universities 1978-79. A random sample of presidents was chosen using a sample size of 200 presidents of community colleges, 200 presidents of senior colleges, and the total population of 93 presidents of universities.Presidents defined in the sample size were asked to mail a copy of their professional resume or vitae. A 72 percent response rate was received. Codings were then developed for every category of information, and individual resumes were coded and recorded on data sheets which were then key punched in preparation for analyses.Initial analyses of the data were performed utilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Analysis of variance, chi square and frequency distribution were statistics used in the analyses.Findings of the study:  (1) Community college and senior college presidents usually earn their doctorate in the field of education while university presidents earn theirs in the social sciences. (2) The percentage of attendance at public institutions for all three groups of presidents was about the same. (3) Most presidents had risen to the presidency from other administrative positions. (4) There was not much transfer of administrative staff members from one type of institution to another, although there was some transferring noted from the college/university level to the community college level. (5) The age at time of assuming current presidency was 48 years for a university president, 46 years for a senior college president and 44 years for a community college president. (6) The tenure in current presidency was 6.5 years for a university president, 7.2 years for a senior college president and 7.6 years for a community college president. (7) There were few absolute clues to a single best set of attributes for a community college, senior college or university president, but some attributes have seemed to be of very high order. Presidents almost always: are male, are married, have families, possess a doctorate, have taught, and have had prior administrative experience. (8) Other attributes of the presidents are frequently apparent but are not of the same overwhelming power as those listed above. Presidents tend: to be middle aged; to have attended a public institution; to have studied in the fields of social science, science, or education; to have been academic vice presidents and to have held several other administrative positions. (9) There is a difference in the career patterns of the presidents of public post-secondary institutions. More specifically, differences exist among the community college, senior college, and university presidents and the differences are related to institutional type.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study attempted to develop a model for interventions to be performed by central office school district change facilitators to support the implementation of an innovation. Interventions reported by respondents from selected effective corporations as having been performed by their corporate office change facilitators provided the basis for the model.A content analysis of business and education literature provided the basis for a questionnaire which included 43 interventions in six categories necessary for support of a total planned change effort. Forty-six corporations noted for their ability to change and 48 Illinois school districts selected because of their complexity or excellence responded to the questionnaire by identifying interventions performed somewhere within their organization and noting those which had been performed by change facilitators at their corporate/central office.The model developed after an analysis of the data included Key and Secondary Interventions. This model suggests those to be performed by school district central office change facilitators. In addition, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) Respondents showed a high interest in the change process and the role of change facilitators. (2) Change facilitators were located throughout corporations and school districts and performed many interventions. (3) School district central office change facilitators performed interventions more frequently than did those at the corporate office of corporations. (4) Interventions designated as Key emphasized planning, securing support, evaluation, and communication with staff and administration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>If f is a meromorphic function in the complex plane, R. Nevanlinna noted that its characteristic function T( r, f) could be used to categorize f according to its rate of growth as |z| = r &amp;rarr; infinity. Later H. Milloux showed for a transcendental meromorphic function in the plane that for each positive integer k,   mr,fk f=o Tr,f asr&amp;rarr;infinity, 0.0.1   possibly outside a set of finite measure where m denotes the proximity function of Nevanlinna theory. If f is a meromorphic function in the unit disk D = { z : |z| &amp;lt; 1}, analogous results to (0.0.1) exist when   limsupr&amp;rarr;1- Tr,f log11-r =+infinity.  0.0.2In this dissertation we consider the class of meromorphic functions   P  in   D  for which   limsupr&amp;rarr;1- Tr,f log11-r &amp;lt;infinity,    limr&amp;rarr;1- Tr,f=+infinity,   and   mr,f'f =oTr,f as r&amp;rarr;1.We explore characteristics of the class and some places where functions in the class behave in a significantly different manner than those for which (0.0.2) holds.</dc:description>

<dc:description>JOINTLESS is a MADS-box gene that plays a key role in tomato flower pedicel abscission zone development. In jointless mutant plants, some inflorescence meristems revert to vegetative growth, their flowering time is slightly delayed, and the sympodial identity of inflorescence meristems is suppressed. However, we still don't know why the lack of the normal JOINTLESS protein has the pleiotropic effects in the mutant's development. Here I report more evidence that JOINTLESS gene is a pleiotropic regulator of tomato growth and development, and it may affect multiple hormone homeostasis in tomato. Compared to wild type plants,  jointless mutant plants have larger and heavier seeds and fruits; delayed germination; thicker, longer hypocotyls, stems and hypocotyls cells; and more and longer internodes. Mature jointless plants are also much taller, they have fewer seeds per fruit, and about 30% of the  jointless fruits have developed irregular fruit locule structure. These phenotypes are similar to some plant hormone mutants. To determine whether  JOINTLESS affects the perception and/or production of plant hormones, dose response experiments were performed on six major plant hormones and some of their inhibitors. The results show that jointless seedlings are more sensitive not only to the external hormones auxin (IAA), ethylene (ACC), gibberellin (GA3), and brassinosteroids (24-eBL), but also to the gibberellin synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) and auxin transport inhibitor N-1-Naphthylphthalamic Acid (NPA). Real-time PCR results show that some key genes involved in ethylene and gibberellin synthesis, auxin signaling and metabolism, and cell wall metabolism are upregulated in the jointless  mutant seedlings. I propose that JOINTLESS is involved in regulating the perception and/or production of multiple plant hormones and/or the crosstalk between them, leading to its pleiotropic effects on tomato growth and development in the mutant plants. A model is proposed to explain how JOINTLESS affects the development of tomato flower pedicel abscission zones. This research not only deepens our understanding of the functional mechanism of JOINTLESS, but also furthers our understanding of plant MADS-box genes' functional mechanism in general. At the same time, because JOINTLESS is involved in regulating traits that are important in agriculture such as fruit abscission zone, fruit size, seed size, and plant height, we may be able manipulate these traits genetically by changing the expression levels of JOINTLESS.</dc:description>

<dc:description>During the past decade the role and functions of the Educational Service Region (ESR) office have become an issue of concern among state and local educational personnel. Recent studies of the ESR in Illinois and the resultant proposals to reorganize this office reflect this concern.The purpose of this study was to identify the potential role of the ESR with regard to 45 possible functions of this office. In addition, the kinds and degree of variance in the perceptions of the role of the ESR office in Illinois was studied.The study population consisted of 78 ESR superintendents, 102 Illinois County Board Chairmen, 300 local school district superintendents in Illinois, outside the city of Chicago, and 13 Illinois Office of Education (IOE) leaders.The perceptions of all four responding groups were compared in an intergroup analysis. The finding of this component of the study was that there was strong disagreement between the four responding groups with regard to their perceptions of the role the ESR office should perform in Illinois education.The perceptions of ESR superintendents, local school district superintendents, and county board chairmen were further compared through an intragroup analysis using geographic and demographic variables. IOE leaders were omitted from this intragrouping analysis because they displayed inadequate variance on geographic and demographic variables. Findings of this component of the study were:  (1) There was general agreement among ESR superintendents in regard to their perceptions of the role of the ESR office when their responses were analyzed by their geographic location within the state, the amount of population within their ESR unit, their years of experience as an ESR superintendent, and the number of Federal Title programs in which their ESR office participated.There was a small amount of disagreement among ESR superintendents in regard to their perceptions of the role of the ESR office when their responses were analyzed by the type of ESR unit (either single or multi-county) in which they served. (2) There was general agreement among the local school district superintendents in regard to their perceptions of the role of the ESR office when their responses were analyzed by their geographical location within the state, their years of experience as a local school district superintendent, the type of grade system in the school district, the number of students in their district, and the distance their office is from the ESR superintendent's office. There was a small to moderate amount of disagreement among local school district superintendents in regard to their perceptions of the role of the ESR office when their responses were analyzed by the population of their ESR unit, the type of ESR unit (either single or multi-county), and the type of their school district (either dual or unit). (3) There was general agreement among the county board chairmen in regard to their perceptions of the role of the ESR office when their responses were analyzed by their geographical location within the state, the type of ESR unit (either single or multi-county), their years of experience as a county board chairman, and whether they were of the same political affiliation as the ESR superintendent in their county.There was a small amount of disagreement among county board chairmen in regard to their perceptions of the role of ESR office when their responses were analyzed by the population of their county.Appropriate recommendations for possible redefinition of the office of the Educational Service Region were made based upon the analysis of the data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of the General Distributive Fund formula in Illinois, the first reform in Illinois school finance since 1927, and to analyze the changes to the formula following the enactment of the state income tax in 1969. The study covers a twelve-year time span concluding with the 1980-81 school year (fiscal year 1981). The political, legislative, and educational forces that forged the Resource Equalizer formula are presented and followed through the subsequent eight years of formula revision.The conclusions were as follows:  (1) The amount of general state aid distributed per student increased dramatically following the enactment of the state income tax. In 1969 the level was $175.44 per pupil in average daily attendance. By 1980 the level was $851.00. During the same period of time the state appropriation for general state aid increased 313 percent. (2) Major modifications of the formula occurred only when large amounts of new money became available. The passage of the state income tax and the advent of federal revenue sharing made significant formula reform possible. Major formula reform cannot be done at the expense of some school districts to the advantage of other school districts. (3) Costly multi-year phase-in plans did not work because future financial difficulties could not be predicted. The difficulties experienced in Illinois with the projected four-year phase-in of the Resource Equalizer formula amply illustrated the frailities of this approach. (4) School finance decisions have been made more difficult in Illinois by the existence of three different types of district organization. Illinois school districts are organized as either elementary, secondary, or unit districts. This arrangement not only complicates formula development but also encourages competition for resources. (5) The education community can better promote common goals if disagreements over formula change are resolved outside the legislative process. The School Problems Commission frequently served as a catalyst for competing factions. (6) School finance reform has usually been a "packaged" deal. Various interest groups coalesce and reach agreements that offer some help to everyone and hurt no one. (7) Governors played a very limited role in school finance reform in Illinois during the time covered by this study. Governor Ogilvie's and Governor Thompson's recommendations for formula change met with little success. Governor Walker made no recommendations for formula change; however, by signing the Resource Equalizer formula bill in 1973, he made the most significant gubernatorial contribution to Illinois school finance reform. (8) The high quality of the work of the School Problems Commission and its leadership has been a major ingredient in the Commission's success. The work product of the Commission since its designation as the first permanent legislative Commission in 1957 has been very consistent. (9) The introduction of computer simulation changed the process of analysis of proposed school finance legislation. The availability of computer printouts showing the impact of various formula modifications on individual school districts led to the development of a broad base of support for some proposals in the education community. Evidence of this support was then used to influence legislators. (10) Taxpayer equity was not addressed during the time covered by this study. A number of property tax reforms were attempted but were opposed by school districts and other units of local government. (11) During the time period covered by this study all school finance formula bills that eventually became law were sponsored by a member of the majority party. (12) Major educational decisions are ultimately political decisions. Legislative decisions on educational issues must be made in relation to all other decisions on public policy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study described the perceptions of superintendents and union presidents regarding the degree of integrative and distributive bargaining patterns present in the collective bargaining process. The study established the presence of varying degrees of cooperative bargaining behaviors on 62 individual contract issues as perceived by 255 matched pairs of management and labor respondents.Based on the results of this study, it was concluded (1) that there were differences in the presence and degree of integrative bargaining behaviors as perceived by management and labor; (2) that the demographic characteristics of a school district's geographic location, organizational type, size of student enrollment, and expenditure per pupil had no effect on the kinds of bargaining patterns perceived by management and labor; and (3) that the presence of cooperative bargaining patterns could be identified in Illinois public school districts.For the vast majority of statistically significantly different contract issues, labor perceived the collective bargaining process as a more competitive or distributive process than management, although both parties reported that the bargaining process was primarily a cooperative process. Although some statistically significant differences were observed on some of the demographic comparisons of a school district's geographic location, organizational type, size of student enrollment, and expenditure per pupil, there were no discernible patterns in the statistically significant differences reported in this study. Finally, it appeared that the majority of statistically significant differences in management and labor's perceptions of the bargaining process were generated by individual contract issues contained within the Working Conditions category of the contract.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The major purpose of this study was to explore the content and process of self-directed continued learning in nursing. A secondary aim was to assess the applicability of the Knox model of life-long self-directed education to self-directed continued learning in nursing.The method of study was descriptive survey. A two-part questionnaire was developed. Part I was designed to obtain information related to the content of self-directed continued learning, and Part II to obtain information on its process. The Knox model was used as a basis for identifying present and desired activities of self-directed continued learning. The instrument was assessed for content validity and tested in a trial study prior to use. The mail-administered questionnaire was completed and returned by 266 members of the Illinois Nurses' Association. The nurses represented all major fields of employment, job positions, clinical areas and varied in their educational background in nursing, chronological age and number of years since graduation from the basic educational program.The results of the study included the following general findings and conclusions:  (1) The content of the respondents' self-directed continued learning in nursing included subject matter related to the nursing process, professional concerns, interrelated processes and supporting sciences and disciplines. The respondents indicated that they most frequently studied content areas involving subject matter that is process-oriented. (2) The bases for the respondents' use of self-directed rather than other-directed learning in the study of a content area were: individual preference for self-directed study; the presence of a programming problem which prevent attendance; and, reasons indicated by the response "Other." (3) Respondents indicated that a program offered at an inconvenient time/place was the most frequently encountered programming problem, followed by the problems of a program not oriented to their needs, unawareness of a program offered in a content area and prohibitive cost of a program. (4) The respondents' perceived effectiveness of self-directed study in learning a content area varied with the content area studied. An association between frequency of study and perceived effectiveness of self-directed study of a content area was suggested, as well as an association between perceived effectiveness of self-directed study of a content area and the relevancy of that area to the respondents' practice setting. (5) There were significant relationships between the frequency of study of content areas, basis for selecting self-directed learning as a mode of learning content areas, perceived effectiveness of self-directed study and the nurses' field/place of employment, job position, major clinical teaching/practice area, basic educational preparation in nursing and the number of years since graduation from the basic nursing program. (6) The process of the respondents' self-directed continued learning in nursing included the performance of learning activities related to: assessing needs, setting objectives, considering environmental factors in learning, conducting learning activities and evaluating. (7) The Knox model of life-long self-directed education formed a workable basis for identifying the respondents' present and desired activities of self-directed continued learning in nursing, and it served to identify a certain learning pattern of the respondents. (8) The Knox model appeared to be related to the respondents' performed and desired activities of self-directed continued learning in nursing. (9) The respondents indicated that nearly all activities of the model would be performed more frequently if resources and/or assistance were provided.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chemometric sensing encompasses a diverse spectrum of applications employing significant numbers of substrate materials that serve as binding sites for analytes. Porous aluminum oxide has served as one such substrate, being relegated solely to water vapor and moisture-sensing applications. Recent work has shown that nanoporous anodized aluminum oxide adsorbs alcohol vapors and cyclic volatile organic compounds and the electrical response of these adsorbates may be measured using impedance spectroscopy. From this work it is demonstrated that the impedance spectrum of pore-adsorbed analytes provides a unique electronic signature. The method developed from this work allows identification of simple compounds including structural isomers that are not readily resolved using conventional analytical methods.Template-assisted growth of nanowires has been of interest during the last decade using a multi-step anodization and etching process. The resultant self-supporting nanowires have been studied as chemometric sensors. These devices have proven mechanically unreliable and costly to manufacture. Additional work by our laboratory has shown that nanowires grown and permanently contained within a nanoporous aluminum oxide matrix function as sensing devices when coupled to a metallic backplane. Permanent containment of the nanowires in the matrix serves to maintain a robust device that does not suffer from the failures and shortcomings of self-supporting nanowires.The significance of impedance spectroscopy coupled with nanoporous aluminum oxide sensors manifests itself in the simplicity of the method. Microcomputer and microcontroller-based designs are inexpensive, portable and employ efficient software algorithms capable of generating the required frequency spectrum and analyzing the sensor response. Unreliable and bulky analytical instrumentation containing large numbers of electronic components may be eliminated. It is expected that further work with nanoporous aluminum oxide will move the sensor technology forward for other applications, specifically, environmental monitoring, hydrogen fuel cell controls, solar energy conversion and possibly carbon sequestration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated the utility of the Instructional Designs Taxonomy (IDT, Seguel, Baldridge, Christensen, Kessler, 1978) for providing a mutually exclusive and exhaustive system for classifying classroom activities. The relationships between these observations and the open-traditional dimension in selected British elementary classrooms were also investigated.The IDT conceptualized classroom activities as consisting of macro and micro design elements which occur and re-occur in a variety of subject matter contexts and which integrate a wide variety of instructional elements. Previous research has focused either on discrete instructional elements or on subject matter fields. Attempts at more integrated approaches have concentrated either on teaching behavior, as in teaching models, or on learner behavior, as in learning styles. The IDT is novel in that it places attention on the interaction between teacher and learner behavior rather than on each one separately. Its usefulness in analyzing classroom organizational structures should be that the focus on the gestalt of activity gives it a neutrality which avoids the polarization toward either teacher or learner which characterizes the literature on structure.The Determination of Classroom Structure Questionnaire (DCSQ), Kessler, 1979) was used to locate classrooms on an open-traditional continuum. Twenty-nine classrooms of varying degrees of open structure in six primary schools in the London area made up the selected sample.Observations were divided into three-minute intervals. A mark was made for each macro and micro design observed in each interval, and the proportion of total marks observed for each macro design was calculated. The most frequently observed macro designs were "stage managing" (.24), "telling" (.20), and "setting a task" (.15). Other macro design proportions were "testing" (.12), "logistics" (.11), "record keeping" (.07), "showing" (.07), and "interviewing" (.05). "Planning" and "paradox" were not observed at all.With macro designs the proportion of three-minute intervals containing each design was calculated. "Monitor" was the most frequent, occurring in .47 of the intervals. Other frequently occurring micro designs were "information" (.27), "logistics" (.27), "behavior" (.25), "oral immediate" (.24), "directions" (.17), "record keeping" (.17), "show" (.15), and "inquiry" (.11).Significant positive correlations were observed between degree of openness and the macro designs "inquiry," "product and variation" and "game." Significant negative correlations were found between degree of openness and "exact product," "program," and "directions."It was concluded that certain instructional designs can be expected to occur frequently in primary classrooms while others will occur less frequently or rarely, regardless of the degree of openness of the classroom. The correlations between designs and degree of openness conform to general expectations for differences between open and traditional classrooms.It appears that the Instructional Designs Taxonomy is a viable instrument for classroom observations. Certain suggestions were made for revising this instrument to increase its potential utility.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between school board demographic/fiscal variables, district harmony variables, and information system variables with respect to Illinois Senate Bill 730, mandated state reform in Illinois. Reform policy was measured by the number of reform-related school board motions reported and passed within local Illinois school board meetings from the period of August 1985 to August 1986. This study provides evidence of the amount and category of local policymaking directly responding to legislated reform. Further, it indicates that particular variables are related to increased reform-oriented policymaking by school boards and demonstrates how school boards react differently to state mandates. Finally, it suggests that school board minutes are a useful and discriminating indicator of local board implementation of Illinois Senate Bill 730, as well as a potential data base for analyzing local obstacles and needs relative to implementing reform.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated two aspects of nursing education within small and rural Illinois hospitals:  (1) the general characteristics of, and educational activities performed by, the individual responsible for directing nursing education, and (2) the relationship between the independent variables of hospital size, health Region of the hospital, professional experience and educational preparation of the Director of Nursing Educational Services, and the dependent variable of educational activities performed by the Director.An assessment of the educational resources and activities available within small and rural hospitals was considered important in order to provide the Director of Nursing Educational Services with information regarding:  (1) what they, themselves, are doing at the present time, (2) what employers, nursing staff and/or Third Party payers may expect of them in the future, and (3) the kinds of competencies which are required to achieve a given ideal model of performance. In addition, an assessment of the educational activities within small and rural hospitals could be utilized to aid in the development of continuing education programs for hospital educators as well as aiding hospital planners in the development of strategies for meeting the educational needs of nursing staff and patients within such institutions.The study revealed that small and rural Illinois hospitals are beginning to attract the same kinds of individuals to direct nursing education as the literature appears to indicate are found in larger, metropolitan institutions. For example, many of the educators had:  (1) five or more years of experience in a training/education role prior to assuming their present position, (2) continued their education to attain baccalaureate and/or graduate degrees within the last ten years, and (3) received higher academic degrees in fields other than nursing.While the majority of educators appeared to be under the control of the nursing department, and 20.0% of the individuals responsible for directing nursing education within the hospitals were either Directors or Assistant Directors of Nursing, movement away from the nursing department was evident. A large number of educators worked in hospitals with separate Departments of Education and were responsible for educating all departments within the hospital. Also, the position of the educator within the hospital hierarchy appeared to be undergoing change, as many educators responded that they reported directly to the Chief Executive Officer or "other" personnel within the institution rather than the Director of Nursing.Overall, the study, which sought to determine quantity of and not quality activities, found no significant relationship between the size of the hospital, the health Region in which the hospital was located or the highest degree earned by the educator and those educational activities which they performed. The educational activities were, however, related to the number of years of experience which the educator had had in the health care field and in a training/education role.Areas which consistently indicated differences in performance included the use of the following:  (a) questionnaires to individual employees to determine educational needs. (b) written documentation and formal, written methods of communicating information to administration and staff. (c) behavioral objectives in evaluative procedures to provide evidence of program effectiveness. (d) evaluative procedures to determine program effectiveness.In summary, the researcher feels that educators must demonstrate to management that their best investment is in human resources and administration must believe that the future of hospitals is in education.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purposes of this study were to determine the vocational interests and attitudes of deaf persons as measured by the Wide Range Interest and Opinion Test (WRIOT), and to determine the manner in which deaf persons, ages 16-19, differed from hearing persons of the same age when vocational interests and attitudes were compared. Differences in vocational interests and attitudes between the deaf persons and hearing persons of the same age were also studied by determining if the deaf persons resembled hearing persons of younger ages or older ages. A sample of 100 male and 100 female deaf students, ages 16-19, were given the WRIOT. The mean scores of these students were reported on each of the 26 interest and attitude scales contained  on the WRIOT. The mean scores of the deaf students were then compared to the scores of hearing students, ages 16-19, 12-15, 8-11, and 20-24.When the deaf students were compared to hearing students of the same age, the deaf students scored lower than the hearing students on the scales of art, literature, music, drama, management, social service, social science, number, ambition, chosen skill level, agreement and positive bias. Deaf males also scored lower than hearing males on the scales of sales, sedentariness and negative bias. In addition, deaf females scored lower than hearing females on the scales of management, biological science, outdoor, athletics and sex stereotype.Similar scores between deaf and hearing students were found on the scales of office work, personal service and physical science. In addition, deaf males scored similarly to hearing males on the scales of biological science, mechanics, outdoor, athletics, risk and sex stereotype. Deaf females also scored similar to hearing females on the scales of sales, protective service and negative bias.Deaf males and females scored higher than hearing males and females on the scale of machine operation. In addition, deaf males scored higher than hearing males on the scale of protective service. Deaf females also scored higher than hearing females on the scales of mechanics and sedentariness.As a group, the deaf students in this study showed lower interests in educational and cultural related vocational interest scales than hearing students. Manual activities were preferred over verbal learning areas. In attitudes, the deaf students tended to aspire toward lower levels of ambition and skill development than hearing students.The following conclusions were made based on the comparisons:  (1) The vocational interest and attitude patterns of deaf students were different from the patterns of hearing students of the same age, of younger ages and of older ages. (2) The deaf students, ages 16-19, resembled the hearing students, ages 12-15, more than they resembled any other group. This was not considered the result of an immature development of vocational interests and attitudes of deaf students, but rather indicative of different dynamics influencing deaf students. (3) The vocational interests and attitudes of the deaf students were the most different from very young hearing students, ages 8-11, and older hearing persons, ages 20-24.The implications of deafness as contributing factors in the differences found between deaf and hearing students were discussed. On some scales implications of deafness were not linked to differences found, indicating programing needs in vocational education. Using the WRIOT in a group process as one strategy to increase the vocational awareness of deaf students was suggested.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the study was to construct an instrument that would be a reliable and valid measurement of young children's interpersonal competence. This instrument would be different from traditional pencil and paper and self-report measures in that the information would be elicited by stimulating audiovisual channels. The research proceeded in two phases.The first phase of the research involved the development of the Audiovisual Inventory of Interpersonal Competence. Fifty-three items depicting children in interpersonal situations around the issues of affection, control and inclusion were produced as a slide-tape program. A panel of reviewers judged the inventory for construct validity and technical quality. The pool of items was administered to one classroom for each grade, second through sixth. An item analysis was conducted and eleven ineffective items were eliminated.The second phase of the research was a study of the reliability and validity of the AIIC. Six-hundred-forty-one subjects aged seven through twelve were administered the AIIC. The classroom teachers of these subjects were asked to rate each child's interpersonal competence through a Q-sort technique. Additionally, each classroom participated in a sociometric assessment of interpersonal competence. The criterion variables of teacher rating, peer nominations and chronological age were correlated with the pupils' responses on the AIIC as an assessment of the concurrent validity of the instrument.A factor analysis was conducted to confirm the panel of reviewer's judgment of the construct validity of the AIIC.The Cronbach Alpha for the AIIC was .89. A Kendall Tau coefficient was calculated for each of the criterion variables. Teacher rating, peer nominations and chronological age showed little correlation with total score on the AIIC. The factor analysis failed to confirm the assumed constructs of affection, control and inclusion as the underlying dimension of the AIIC. One general factor and another minor factor accounting for 58.5% of total variation emerged from the factor analysis. These factors have been tentatively named Responsibility and Conflict Management.The following conclusions were made: the AIIC proved to be a very reliable instrument in this study; the AIIC does not seem to be a very valid measure of interpersonal competence when compared to teacher rating, peer nominations and chronological age; and the AIIC consists of one general factor (Responsibility), and another minor factor (Conflict Management). Thus, the AIIC is a reliable instrument that may be measuring critical elements of interpersonal competence. Further research to confirm the construct and criterion validity of the factors responsibility and conflict management is warranted.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The peer interactions of elementary-aged students with learning disabilities were recorded using naturalistic observation techniques. More specifically, this study examined the extent to which peer type, activity type, initiation type, and interaction content were conditionally related to the rates, average response times, and response patterns of peer interactions. The Epson HX-20 computer system was used to collect data in real time on nine categories of behavior as they related to the peer interactions between target students with learning disabilities and (a) their nonhandicapped peers and (b) their mildly handicapped peers. Each of the 24 target students was observed for one full school day. Data were summarized across subjects for descriptive purposes and were tested for significance using a mixed-design analysis of variance measure and a log-linear analysis measure. The peer relations of target students with learning disabilities were found to vary according to (a) peer type, (b) initiation type, (c) initiator, (d) activity type, and (e) interaction content. Implications were discussed in terms of assessment practices, program development, and teacher training. Moreover, the exploratory nature and findings of this study indicate the need to further study the peer relations of students with learning disabilities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was designed to determine the respective roles that change facilitators--parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents--perceive for themselves in areas related to educational change and development. Role perceptions were compared to reveal areas of agreement and difference. Selected school characteristics were analyzed to determine their possible affect on the perceptions of the respondents.Data for this study were collected using two instruments--a questionnaire and the Role Norm Inventory. The questionnaire contained five items and was developed to determine the attitudes of parents, teachers, and principals toward the activities of parent-teacher groups and advisory committees. The Role Norm Inventory contained 58 norm statements from five specific categories. These categories were: Role with Community; Role in School Management; Role with Children; Role with Curriculum; and Role with Staff. It was used to determine the roles that respondents perceived for members of their respective groups.The study was conducted in 15 Cook County school districts outside Chicago. Twenty-six schools participated. Returns of 80.15% of parents, 77.28% of teachers, 96.15% of principals, and 86.66% of superintendents were received. The chi-square test was used to analyze the data by the presence of either a PTA or a PTO, by the use or unuse of advisory committees, by the perceived impact of the PTA/PTO on change, and by the perceived impact of advisory committees on change.The following conclusions were based on the findings:  (1) Parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents each desire a major role in educational change and development. (2) More than one group of change facilitators will often desire involvement with the same role. (3) PTA/PTO's are perceived as performing many important functions in the schools, but only principals as a group reported a majority feeling that such groups have impact on change. (4) Advisory committees have been used in a wide variety of areas in the schools, but less than half of the parents, teachers, and principals reported that these committees have impact on change. (5) There are significant differences between the role perceptions of the respondent groups. (6) There is probably no difference in parent attitudes toward involvement in educational change and development regardless of whether the school has a PTA or a PTO. (7) The use of advisory committees seems to be related to the desire for parent involvement in roles with curriculum. (8) Having a PTA/PTO, which is perceived as having an impact on change, seems to be related to the desire for parent involvement in roles with community and with curriculum. (9) Advisory committees, which are perceived as having an impact on change, seem to be related to the desire for involvement by parents in roles with community, with curriculum, and with staff. There is also strong evidence that the inverse is equally true. (10) There are some differences in teachers' attitudes toward change depending on whether the school has a PTA or a PTO. (11) The use of advisory committees seems to be related to the desire for participation by teachers in roles in school management. (12) The perceived impact of the PTA/PTO has some relationship to teacher involvement in educational change and development. (13) The perceived impact of advisory committees seems to have little or no relationship to teacher involvement in educational change and development.Education will continue to change. Perusal of the study's findings and conclusions should foster understanding and promote cooperative action between all who are concerned with the pursuit of excellence in education.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation empirically examines three distinct theories of aggregate strike activity in Nigeria to determine whether they yield similar or different inferences when fitted to Nigerian data for the 1950-1985 period. The empirical performance and the validity of the inferences from the results may be questioned in some respects because of the impact of institutional factors on key endogenous and exogenous variables.In addressing these problems, this dissertation employs the simultaneous equations model of aggregate strike activity in order to provide some valid inferences about the proximate determinants of strike activity in Nigeria. In our model, we examined the additive, interactive, and combined effects of incomes policies on wages and strikes, and price control policies on aggregate prices. We employed Two- and Three-Stage Least Squares estimation methods for the structural equations. We tested for structural changes between policies-on and policies-off periods, and also for the direction of causation among variables.As a contribution to the literature, this dissertation provides the empirical evidence of the impact of strike activity on the development process in Nigeria. Our empirical investigation is inspired by the controversy of whether or not strike activity impedes economic development in less developed countries.There are two sets of findings from this dissertation. First, the results of the models tested showed that: (a) strike activity correlates positively with the business cycles; (b) strike activity and real wages are inversely related, as was found in the studies of advanced countries; (c) strike activity and unemployment rate are positively related; and (d) past strike activity has no depressing impact on current strike activity.Second, the results of our model showed that: (1) strike activity is influenced by aggregate price level; (2) strikes relate negatively to wages and positively to unemployment rate; (3) economic and institutional factors are important in strike determination; (4) there is no evidence of strikes withering away or past strike activity negatively influencing current strike activity; (5) there are evidences of structural changes and unidirectional causality in our model; and (6) strike activity impedes the development process in Nigeria.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The problem of this study was to investigate the nature and extent of continuing professional learning and opinion concerning continuing professional learning issues of registered dietitians. The subjects were registered dietitians employed full-time in the Chicago metropolitan area. From a population of 453, a random sample was drawn. Returns from the mailed questionnaire numbered 205 of which 194 or 84.3 percent were usable.The study examined the extent to which selected variables influenced continuing professional learning. The independent variables were age, highest degree earned, current student status, years in dietetic practice, nature of current position, place of employment, years in present position, and number of registered dietitians employed in the institution. Dependent variables were three types of continuing professional learning. The first included all learning activities eligible for American Dietetic Association (ADA) continuing education credit. In-service education provided by employers, but not eligible for ADA credit, was a second area. Thirdly, self-initiated learning activities not eligible for ADA credit were included. Clock hours of continuing professional learning were reported for a six-month period. The three categories were summed to provide total hours of continuing professional learning.Results of the survey showed that all but two dietitians had participated in continuing professional learning. A total of 22,809 hours of continuing professional learning was reported by respondents during a six-month period, a mean of 117.6 hours per dietitian or 19.6 hours per month.Results indicated that significantly more hours were devoted to activities not eligible for ADA continuing education credit than to activities which were eligible. Significantly more hours were devoted to self-initiated learning than to in-service education provided by employers. Dietitians were not interested only in learning activities for credentialing purposes.A correlation was established between highest degree earned and total hours of continuing professional learning. An advanced degree was the best predictor of participation in continuing learning. Positive correlations were found between both size of staff and years in the current position and mean hours of in-service education. There were negative correlations between both years in dietetic practice and age and mean hours of self-initiated learning.Nature of current position and place of employment were other variables. Dietitians employed in research positions reported the highest total mean hours of continuing professional learning. Mean hours of ADA-approved activities were highest among those employed in business and in colleges and universities. In-service education was greatest among those employed in hospitals while self-initiated learning was greatest among those employed in colleges and universities.All but 22 respondents reported hours of self-initiated learning. Professional reading was reported most frequently, followed by consultation with other dietitians.The majority of dietitians indicated that their continuing education needs were met. Larger numbers indicated that Association programs and self-initiated activities best met their continuing education needs. Preference for the provider of continuing education showed that the majority preferred dietetic associations to provide programs. Almost an equal number believed that employers should sponsor more educational programs. Large numbers indicated that self-initiated learning activities and Association programs had increased their competence to practice. Approximately one-third of the dietitians agreed that they needed assistance in planning their professional development and about 40 percent believed that they needed assistance in finding resources for professional development.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated the effects of student disruptions and the allocation of self study time on teachers' instructional time allocations in elementary school classrooms. Instructional allocations were studied both in a computer simulated classroom with six students and in natural fifth and sixth grade classrooms. The instructional allocations made in the simulated classroom by 28 certified teachers and 120 undergraduate college students were compared to those made by 6 certified teachers in their natural classrooms. The simulated students' learning parameters were defined in terms of a modified Thurstone (1930) learning function which was used to calculate achievement levels after each of the forty simulated class periods. The effects of student disruptions upon the instructional allocations were studied by assigning each subject to one of six disruption conditions in which an identified student disrupted (i.e., a high or low ability male or female student), an anonymous student disrupted, or no student disrupted. In the simulated classroom, college students and certified teachers allocated instructional time to the class as a whole in a strikingly similar manner. Approximately 58% of the "teachers'" instructional time was spent teaching the class as a group (36% in group instruction and 22% in group self study). The remaining time was allocated in three ways: individual instruction, individual self study, and unallocated time. For both groups, allocation of individual instruction was a decreasing function of the simulated students' ability levels, individual self study was an inverted U-shaped function of ability levels, and unallocated time was increasing function of ability levels. While the individual instructional allocations of college students and teachers were similar, they differed in either the pattern of allocations or the magnitude of differences between the ability levels for individual self study and unallocated time, respectively. While student disruptions influenced none of the allocations to the class as a whole, all three individually allocated instructional modes were significantly affected. However, no systematic trends were found for the aspects of the student disruptions which were of interest to this study (i.e., disruption per se, the ability level and the sex of the disrupting students).During mathematics instruction in their natural classrooms, the group self study, individual instruction, and individual self study allocations of certified teachers were similar to the allocations of both groups of "teachers" in the simulated classroom. However, teachers in their natural classrooms allocated half as much group instruction as allocated in the simulated classrooms. No appreciable amounts of unallocated time were observed in the natural classrooms. Student disruptions in the natural classroom, although quite prevalent (occurring during 35% of the observations), did not appear to influence instructional allocations.The current study's findings were quite similar to the results of previous classroom simulation studies. The allocations were discussed in terms of decision making in the classroom and the need to consider context variables in classroom research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There is no clear evidence in the literature indicating that problem-solving follows from the development of computational skill. This study examines whether computational skill is related to problem-solving ability. The results from this study will assist curriculum developers as to whether the current approach to problem-solving is enabling students to solve problems, or if this approach is demanding unreasonable expectations. Students' success on four types of word problems in the curriculum were examined in order to construct measures of problem-solving ability necessary for this study. These word problems represent the types of mathematical problems that most people have to solve as well as representing a progression in difficulty. The mathematical concepts and operations that were used to construct a measure of computational skill ability include the whole number operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and the rational number operations dealing with fractions, decimals, and percents. The development of these concepts and the ability to perform the related computations were used to construct measures representing levels of difficulty. Data from the 1984 Illinois Inventory of Educational Progress were chosen as indicators of students' ability to be problem solvers with regard to their computational skill. Results from the study indicate that computational skill and problem-solving are related. This study shows that the students who are able to correctly answer the computation problems are more likely to correctly solve the word problems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigates the social behavior and selected personal history characteristics of prostitutes and other working women in order to determine whether significant differences exist between these two populations. The uniqueness of this study lies in its approach to the study of prostitution from within a non-deviant and non-pathological framework.A total of 64 women, including 32 full-time prostitutes and 32 working full-time in other occupations, were selected for this study. The sample consists of prostitutes who were actively working the streets, in bars, and in houses of prostitution in various parts of the United States and women in a variety of other occupations. The non-prostitute sample was selected to match the prostitute sample on the basis of age, race, education, and marital status. Although religion was not one of the selection criteria, the two populations matched in this characteristic as well. The FIRO-B questionnaire was used to collect data on social behavior. A Personal History Questionnaire, developed by this researcher, was used to collect data on personal history characteristics. The t-test and chi-square were utilized in the analysis of data. The 0.05 level of confidence was used as the criterion for hypothesis rejection.The two major null hypotheses tested were:  (1) there are no significant differences between prostitutes and non-prostitutes in social behavior as measured by the FIRO-B, and (2) there are no significant differences between prostitutes and non-prostitutes in the personal history characteristics measured by the Personal History Questionnaire.The first hypothesis was retained for thirteen of the sixteen FIRO-B scores. It is, therefore, concluded that there are not significant differences between prostitutes and non-prostitutes in the areas of expressed and wanted inclusion, total inclusion, expressed and wanted affection, total affection, wanted control, total social behavior, and the differences between expressed and wanted inclusion, control, and affection. Significant differences were found between the prostitutes and non-prostitutes in the expressed control, total control, and total difference variables. These differences appear to stem from the non-prostitutes' tendency to avoid making decisions and taking the initative in their interpersonal relationships, while the prostitutes appear to more closely match the normative population in these areas.The second hypothesis tested was retained for nine of the personal history characteristics and was rejected for five. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that there are not significant differences between prostitutes and non-prostitutes in reported scholastic achievement, perceived friendships, parenthood, number of children, parents living together, reported job satisfaction, other jobs held, age of first dating experience, and whether their first sexual experience was by force or by choice. There were significant differences between the prostitutes and non-prostitutes in the characteristics of age of first sexual experience, reported use of drugs, parents' marital status, years at present jobs, and relatives' knowledge of their work. The prostitutes reported having had sex at an earlier age, a higher rate of drug use, working longer at their present jobs, a higher incidence of never-married single parents, and a greater tendency to withhold the nature of their work from relatives.Conclusions drawn from this study include the rejection of the label deviant commonly ascribed to prostitutes, and the stereotyped thinking and preconceived notions about prostitution which dominate the literature. The conclusions support the study of prostitution from a non-deviant, non-pathological framework. Recommendations for further research are given.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis uses two alternative models to study the structure of the Greek aggregate economy, 1953-77. Attention is focused on the properties of imports as a factor of production, and on the role of energy as an input. For both models a translog cost function specification is used.The translog cost function is superior to the traditional Cobb-Douglas and CES functions in that it imposes no a priori restrictions on separability or on the Allen-Uzawa partial elasticities of substitution.Previous studies engaged with the Greek manufacturing sector only, have used the CES production function in a two-input, one-output specification. The present study is a substantial extension and improvement over the existing studies due to the information provided by the flexible translogarithmic function and due to the incorporation of additional inputs.Model I is based on a two-output and three-input specification. Output consists of consumption and investment goods produced by the primary inputs, capital and labor, and imports which are treated as a third factor of production. In Model II we introduce energy in lieu of imports and study the way this non-primary input interacts with primary factors of production. The incorporation of imports, especially after the full association of Greece with the European Economic Community, and of energy, after the drastic increases in the price of oil internationally, makes this study important.Before implementing the models, we explain the duality between cost and production functions, the benefits of using the cost specification, the concepts aggregation and separability, and explain the way they fit into the translog specification. The relationship between separability and the Allen-Uzawa partial elasticities of substitution, of  special importance for this research, also is explained.Model II concentrates on the role of energy in the production process. As in Model I, input-output separability prevails. Also, linear separability of capital and energy from labor is accepted implying, thus, a partial Cobb-Douglas specification. All other types of separability are rejected at the 5 percent level of significance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Through techniques of grounded theory methodology, this study described the evolving role of the individual nurse consultant as experienced by practitioners of consultation in nursing. Participants in this study identified and described the various factors and dimensions that contributed to their decision to become and work as nurse consultants.Interview data from 15 participants actively practicing as nurse consultants provided four core categories that described the evolving role of the nurse consultant. These four categories were: pre-consultant nursing identity, initial modes of entry into consulting, adoption of the nurse consultant role, and integration of the functional roles of consultant. The major properties that characterized the natural progression of each of the core categories were described and analyzed.This study was undertaken to assist educators in the fields of adult education, nursing, and human resource development in the preparation of the nurse to function in the consultant role. It contributes a theoretical framework that can be employed as a guide in the formal education and training of the professional nurse. In addition, the experienced nurse entering into the consulting field can use the framework as a basis for engaging in self-directed learning of the consultant role.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Eighty subjects were pretested for motor performance ability on a rotor-pursuit task and on magnitude of cardiac response to a novel stimulus. From the original group of eighty subjects, the thirty largest orienters and the thirty smallest orienters were chosen. From each group of thirty the ten subjects showing the best performance on the motor performance task and the ten subjects showing the poorest performance on this task were chosen to attempt to implement voluntary changes in heart rate. Heart rate, respiratory rate and two measures of chin electromyographic (EMG) activity were measured during five acceleration and five deceleration training trials. A no-feedback acceleration trial and a no-feedback deceleration trial preceded and followed the feedback trials. The order in which the trials were presented was randomized, and analogue feedback was provided by a meter.The results indicated that only one group of subjects (the High Performance-Low Orienting group) was able to produce significant increases in heart rate when feedback was provided. Subjects high in motor performance ability increased heart rate significantly without feedback after the training with feedback, whereas subjects low in motor performance ability could not increase their heart rates when no feedback was provided. Neither group was able to increase heart rate without feedback before the feedback trials were implemented. Subjects appeared able to decrease heart rate without feedback and with feedback. Decelerative ability was not affected by motor performance ability or orienting magnitude. Heart rate changes were often, but not always, accompanied by parallel changes in somatic-muscular activity.In general, the results suggested that the skills involved in increasing heart rate may be conceptually similar to those employed in performing a motor task. In addition, the ability to increase heart rate may be inhibited in individuals who exhibit large decelerative heart rate responses to novel stimuli. It also appeared that ability to decrease heart rate may not involve skills similar to those employed during a motor task. Decreases in heart rate were more often accompanied by parallel decreases in respiratory rate and EMG activity than were increases in heart rate, suggesting that cardiac-somatic coupling may be involved in attempting to decrease heart rate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation examined the institutional agenda of an American state legislature. Theories of collective action proposed by James Coleman and analytical observations of Jack Walker on legislative activism were combined to form the foundation for an analysis of bills introduced into a legislature. The objective was an examination of the efficacy of individual initiatives in the institutional context of a legislature. It sought to determine which legislators were able to get their bills actively considered.The data were developed from records of the Kansas House of Representatives and published information on its membership. A measure of agenda control was constructed from the bills introduced by individual, committee, and coalition sponsors. Subject area specialists were identified using an information theoretic measure of concentration. Additional information, as independent variables, was collected on individual and legislative characteristics. The agenda control measure was analysed using mean comparisons and cross-classifications with the independent variables. A summary statement, using dichotomous multivariate regression, compared the major sources of agenda control.The data suggested that agenda control was more likely to be associated with internal, legislative attributes than external, non-legislative attributes. Subject area specialists exerted greater agenda control than non-specialists. Party affiliation had an inconsequential impact.Traditional members of the institutional elite (Speaker, party leadership, and committee chairmen) scored high on the control measure. The advantage of cosponsored bills over those with a single sponsor was marginal and did not increase with coalition size. Committees had twice the agenda control of members.The most significant factors in the agenda control analysis were used to estimate the likelihood that a bill, progressively, left committee favorably, passed the House, and was enacted. Party affiliation of the sponsor had no impact except at the House passage stage. Subject area specialization had a positive impact on the success probability when the subject area of the sponsor matched that of the bill. When these attributes conflicted, a pronounced negative impact was observed. Leadership position and committee sponsorship had a significant positive impact, with the committee impact twice the leadership impact. All relationships declined in the later stages.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The problem for this investigation was: "How do detailed and nondetailed weekly assignments affect achievement in biology by preparatory school male students?" The detailed assignments employed block diagrams and specific stepwise directions, leading to complete essay answers. The nondetailed assignments were virtually devoid of these, providing only general guidelines for the student.The accessible population was the 101 tenth grade preparatory school male students enrolled at Marmion Military Academy, Aurora, Illinois for the school year 1980-1981. The 95 students in this accessible population enrolled in the first year biology course constituted the sample. The target population was the estimated 10,000 male and female preparatory school students enrolled in tenth grade first year biology classes of schools belonging to the Independent Schools Association of the Central States.A pretest-posttest, randomized, two groups, experimental, factorial design was used to compare the effects of the assignments (active independent variables) on achievement in biology. Two by three analysis of variance was done to determine these effects on residualized posttest score means (dependent variable) of 95 students variously grouped by intellectual capability (attribute independent variables). The pretest-posttest was the Nelson Biology Test, Form E. The upper, middle, and lower thirds as well as the total range of students grouped for separate analyses according to ability (deviation intelligence quotient or DIQ), achievement, reflected in the grade point average (G.P.A.), and achievement, based on the final biology grade, were analyzed.Based on the residualized posttest means, students had a significant achievement advantage:  (1) in the total detailed assignment groupings based on DIQ and G.P.A., (2) in the middle detailed DIQ and G.P.A. thirds compared to their respective nondetailed peers. For all other groups there was no significant achievement advantage in having done detailed or nondetailed assignments. However, there was an indication for future research that especially in the lower third of the DIQ groupings students who did detailed assignments achieved less than those who did nondetailed assignments.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Prolegomena for "Titus Andronicus": The texts and editorial methods.</dc:title>

<dc:description>The editorial as well as the literary critical treatment of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus has been influenced by doubts as to Shakespeare's authorship of the play, by varying conceptions of his artistry, by ignorance of the conventions of blood revenge tragedies, and by a distrust of the first quarto text stemming from a distorted view of its printer, John Danter. The result has been an editorial tradition of taking frequent and peculiar liberties with the text of the play. Moreover, an examination of the editions of Titus subsequent to the 1594 first quarto reveals contradictions between the editors' announced editorial methodology and their actual practice, especially in their fidelity to and choice of copy-text and in their use, record, and justification of emendation. Tracing the appearance and disappearance of a number of variants in these editions demonstrates the existence of conjectural emendations based on little or no evidence but traditionally considered part of Shakespeare's text. Before yet another edition of Titus is prepared, its text must be "unedited," freed from a corrupting editorial tradition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It was the purpose of this study to investigate relationships between community college/high school articulation practices and high school counselors' knowledge of community college programs and services. Three questions were addressed in this study:  (1) What specific community college/high school articulation practices are used by community colleges, and to what extent are these practices used? (2) How knowledgeable are high school counselors of community college programs and services? (3) What relationships exist between these community college/high school articulation practices and high school counselors' knowledge of community college programs and services?To collect information about 24 community college/high school articulation practices and current community college programs and services, a 72-item questionnaire was developed and sent to 56 persons in eighteen Illinois community colleges, each of whom was responsible for high school articulation at his/her community college. To collect information regarding high school counselors' knowledge of community college programs and services, a 48-item questionnaire was sent to 526 high school counselors in 130 high schools in the districts associated with those same eighteen community colleges. Questionnaire responses were analyzed using frequency measures and Kendall's tau correlation coefficients.The study resulted in the following major findings:  (1) The typical articulation practice is carried out less than once each year and is more likely to be directed toward high school students or counselors than toward high school teachers or matters of curriculum articulation. (2) Eighty-four percent of colleges in the study perform all of the articulation practices surveyed at least to some extent. (3) High school counselors respond correctly to 69 percent of the questions about programs and services. (4) High school counselors are slightly more knowledgeable about community college services than they are about community college programs. (5) There is a positive correlation of .30 between all articulation practices taken in the aggregate and high school counselors' overall knowledge of community college programs and services.The findings suggest the utility of continued use of articulation practices as part of an on-going, coordinated effort, with each activity occuring at least once each year.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigates the effects of currency area exchange rate changes on trade balances of individual members instead of the area as a whole. A member country's trade is classified into trade inside and outside of the area. Adding the characteristics of trade by currency area, the formula for the change in trade balance are derived. From this formula, it is concluded that whether a member country's trade balance will be improved (worsened) as a consequence of area devaluation (appreciation) depends on the proportionate change in the exchange rate, price elasticities of demand for and supply of imports and exports by currency area, initial patterns of trade by currency area, and the proportionate change of imports and exports within the area to which this country belongs.Using the derived formula, the effects of the 1971 currency realignment are evaluated empirically. Countries are classified into three currency areas: the U.S. dollar area, the area devaluing against the dollar, and the area appreciating against the dollar. Three countries of the dollar area, the U.S., Taiwan, and Thailand, are selected. In all cases the empirical evidence supports the proposed theoretical position. The price elasticities and patterns of trade by currency area significantly explain the direction of balance of trade change. Trade within the dollar area caused the U.S. trade balance to worsen and reduced the possible improvement of the Thai trade balance, but increased the Taiwanese trade surplus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated 294 Illinois public elementary school principals' perceptions regarding the importance of competencies in their role, the level at which continued development should begin, and the preferred sources of training. Responses were analyzed based on the variables of school size and length of experience. Principals completed a survey containing 68 competency statements.Principals considered all of the competencies to be of great to moderate importance. Categories of competencies, in descending order of importance, were: (1) school climate, (2) instruction, (3) interpersonal relations and communication, (4) curriculum, (5) staff development and evaluation, (6) planning and decision making, (7) personnel, (8) resource management, (9) building operations, and (10) community support. A majority of the respondents reported that they could apply competencies within 7 of the 10 categories. However, community support, resource management, and building operations were categories for which principals reported being least able to use related skills.Overall, the sources of continued development activities most preferred by principals were as follows, in descending order: (1) seminars and workshops, (2) district inservice, (3) on-the-job training, (4) university coursework, (5) networks and mentors, (6) none, and (7) professional organizations. It was concluded that principal experience and school size were not influential in principals' selection of responses to questions regarding competencies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationships of children's oral and written language with their reading comprehension scores. The sample included 108 children, ages nine, ten, eleven, and twelve. Stimulus pictures were used to elicit oral and written language samples.The language samples were analyzed to assess the T-units, total words, dependent clauses, a subordination ratio, words per T-unit, and words per clause. Reading comprehension scores were the children's scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Subtest R.Statistical analyses showed the mean number of oral T-units is significantly correlated with reading comprehension scores for all subjects as well as the ten- and eleven-year-old group. The mean number of written T-units was significantly correlated with reading scores for only the nine-year-old group.The number of words per oral clause and written clause is significantly correlated with reading comprehension.The number of oral noun clauses was significantly correlated with reading comprehension scores.The number of words per written clause is the best single predictor of reading comprehension scores, accounting for about 10 percent of the variance in reading scores.When only oral variables are used to predict reading scores, the number of words per oral clause is the best single predictor, accounting for about 7 percent of the variance of scores.When only the written measures were used, the number of words per written clause and the number of written noun clauses accounted for about 12 percent of the variance in reading scores.In this study, better readers used fewer T-units in their oral language than poorer readers. Better readers used more words per clause in their oral language. Better readers used more words per written clause.Oral and written language production is related to reading comprehension. The present research indicates that both oral and written language measures can be useful tools in evaluating children's reading achievement.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The idea of political generation makes intuitive sense. This dissertation investigated the extent a political environment in which voters come of age colors their partisan and attitudinal characteristics, and whether political generations can be differentiated by levels of issue voting.If environment structures enduring political perceptions differentially by age, that effect should be strongest during eras that are most highly politicized. Thus a critical partisan realignment should provide an appropriate test condition for the political generation effect.Postulations were deduced from socialization theory suggesting that a generation coming of age during a critical realignment exhibits unique partisan and attitudinal orientations, and these distinctions have long-term consequences. A quasi-experimental design was employed to compare voting and attitudinal responses of those socialized during a partisan realignment with those socialized in a period of normal politics. Aggregate (county level) election data were used to ascertain the terminal points of the New Deal partisan realignment as 1931 and 1940. From these dates, and several empirical studies, a realignment generation was defined as those born between 1909 and 1923. This generation was then compared to the prerealignment one (those born prior to 1909) in terms of partisanship, attitudes toward the social role of the federal government, and level of issue voting. A cohort analysis was employed using survey data from the American Institute of Public Opinion (Gallup Polls) for the 1936-48 period, and the Center for Political Studies for 1952-76.Theses analyses found that the realignment generation showed greater support for Democratic presidential candidates and government activism than the elder cohort in the 1930s and 1940s. Later this partisan differential decreased but the linkage between many government activism issues and voting was stronger in the prerealignment cohort; the realignment generation exhibited more issue voting only in certain symbolic issue areas.Thus opinion formation (and its linkage with voting) is contingent upon the environment in which political stimuli are encountered, the quality/quantity of previously stored experiences, and the type of opinion involved. The conclusions included suggestions for further research into a respecification of socialization theory in general, and political generation theory in particular.</dc:description>

<dc:title>THE DETERMINANTS OF INTERNATIONAL DIRECT INVESTMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</dc:title>

<dc:description>This study is primarily an empirical investigation into the causes and motivation for international direct investment. Empirical tests are undertaken of the major tenets of the traditional theory of direct investment flows, as well as the effects on direct investment flows of such additional factors as: the anticipated variability of exchange rates, the availability of credit, tariff barriers to trade, and capital movement restrictions. At its most expansive level, the study examines United States investments in the European Economic Community, Canada, and Mexico.The study begins by outlining the importance of understanding the determinants of direct investment from the points of view of both government policymakers and direct investors. After defining direct investment concepts in Chapter 1, theoretical development of direct investment determinants is undertaken. Chapter 2 sets the stage by reviewing capital and investment theory in general; while Chapters 3 and 4 develop the theory of international direct investment specifically. Chapter 3 reviews direct investment theory established in the literature, and Chapter 4 sets up a theoretical model to examine specific hypotheses in order to evaluate empirical results in subsequent chapters. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 then present the results of these empirical investigations.The market size and market growth hypotheses, which are the direct investment equivalents of the accelerator principle in domestic investment theory, are examined extensively in Chapter 5. Innovations here include the use of distributed lags (not previously used for direct investment studies) and the use of predicted sales as the measure of output rather than GNP or current sales.The effects of exchange rates on direct investment are examined in Chapter 6. An innovation is attempted in the development of an exchange rate variable that captures the effects of changing investors expectations regarding exchange rates. Purchasing power parity theory is used to develop a shadow exchange rate that captures the effects of the "rational" expectations of investors.Tariff barriers to trade and the effects of capital controls are examined in Chapter 7, along with tests for structural stability of the model under the hypothesis that a structural change occurred in 1973 with the beginning of the system of floating exchange rates.The study finds overwhelming support for the market size and market growth hypotheses in all areas examined. Exchange rate changes, or the anticipations of these changes as measured by the purchasing power parity exchange rate, are also important in determining investor behavior. The results indicate only weak support for the contention that controls on capital movements were effective. It is suggested that the controls were somewhat effective in their initial years, but no noticeable change in investor behavior is observed at the time of their elimination. Using the full model, there is no support for the tariff discrimination hypothesis. This is in spite of the fact that there is strong theoretical support for the hypothesis, and in tests of less complete models some support was found. Tests for structural shift present conclusive evidence that a shift occurred in 1973, the year exchange rates began floating. Out-of-sample forecasting is used to measure the effect of this shift on direct investment in the 1973 to 1977 period.The study employs techniques new to the study of international direct investment, and attempts empirical estimation of relationships such as the effects of exchange rates, where little empirical work had been done previously. Finally, the data set used is more extensive than those used in previous studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This ex post facto research study examined the relationships between a student's selection of the general education curricular program and readily available data from student records including sex, composite achievement score, aptitude, mother's educational level, and grade point average. The multivariate technique of discriminant function analysis was used to statistically discriminate among three curricular programs--college preparatory, vocational education, and general education. Students from two secondary school districts formed the sample for this study.In one school, four predictor variables (sex, achievement, aptitude, and grade point average) loaded on one discriminant function. For the other school, two statistically significant functions were derived using the variables of sex, achievement, and grade point average.The discriminant functions were able to separate the college preparatory group from the other two curricular groups--vocational education and general education. The functions, however, were not able to discriminate between the vocational education and the general education groups.</dc:description>

<dc:title>THE EXCLUSION OF FEMALE STUDENTS FROM THE PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF BOSTON, 1820-1920.</dc:title>

<dc:description>This historical study attempts to determine why the people of Boston chose to exclude female students from the educational opportunities that they willingly provided their sons. It concludes that the popularly elected Boston School Committee was willing to exclude female students from educational opportunities because it accepted a limited role or "sphere" for women that was separate and distinct from the sphere allotted to men. Thus, efforts to expand the educational opportunities available to females generally included attempts to re-define the appropriate sphere of women in American society.When Boston established the nation's first high school in 1821, the school was open only to boys. Since this school was designed to prepare students for business, and since the Boston School Board accepted the notion that the only place for women was in the home, the Board gave no consideration to making that school available to girls. The advocates of female education agreed that women should be restricted to the domestic sphere, but they argued that the effectiveness of women within that sphere would ultimately determine the future of the nation. A high school education would enable women to "exert a solitary influence upon future generations," they argued, and they called for the creation of a separate high school for girls to provide that education. During the second quarter of the nineteenth century, this rationale was the major premise presented in support of educational opportunities for females. It was not until 1855, however, that the Boston School Committee agreed to establish a permanent high school for girls.The acceptance of a limited sphere for women that was inherent in this women's sphere rationale, prevented it from demanding that girls receive the college preparatory education that Boston had provided for boys since 1635. In the post-Civil War era, however, a resurgence of the woman's rights movement led to the formation of a number of active women's groups, and in 1877 several of these groups called upon the Boston School Committee to open the Boston Latin School and its college preparatory program to the city's girls. These groups based their appeal on the concepts of justice, fairness and equal opportunity--concepts that were far removed from the ideology of women's sphere. Opponents of the proposal agreed that the girls should have access to a college preparatory program, but argued that the physiological differences between the sexes, as well as their differences "in respect to function and destination," made it imperative that boys and girls receive their education in separate schools. The Boston School Committe agreed with that position and formalized a policy of providing separate, but theoretically identical secondary school programs for the city's boys and girls.The emergence of the industrial education movement upset the education parity that the Board had attempted to establish. That movement called for different schooling for different students, and it made sex the major criterion for this differentiation. Although the movement acknowledged that women might work outside of the home, it insisted that their vocational training be linked to the domestic sphere. As a result, the movement perpetuated sexual stratification and offered training that generally was of limited economic relevance to women. By 1920 Boston had established the structure of its modern secondary school system--a system that provided separate and unequal educational opportunities on the basis of sex.A brief epilogue examines the sexual segregation that continued to characterize Boston secondary schools in 1970, and it reviews the emotional struggle that transformed these schools into coeducational institutions in 1972.</dc:description>

<dc:title>POLITICAL CONFLICT AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE IN THE CITY OF NARBONNE (AUDE), 1848 TO 1871.</dc:title>

<dc:description>This study investigates the development of political conflict in the city of Narbonne between 1848 and 1871. These two dates were not chosen arbitrarily: 1848 marked the introduction of republicanism among the city's masses while the Narbonne Commune of 1871 represented the most dramatic and bold episode of popular militancy in the city during the nineteenth century. The link between these dates was the Second Empire, a period of massive social and economic change in France.Many historians have argued that the socio-economic transformations of the Second Empire also modernized the nature of political conflict in France. This study of Narbonne demonstrates that the relationship was not as straight-forward as the above argument suggests. Narbonne experienced profound economic and social change during the Second Empire. Yet this change reinforced the traditional artisan work structure of the city and, when combined with government repression of popular political activity throughout most of the Second Empire, preserved the ideological goal of militants during 1848-51, the establishment of the republique democratique et sociale. In this sense, the Narbonne Commune did not represent a radical new step in the development of working class consciousness. It was rather a continuation of a struggle that had started with the proclamation of the Second Republic.However, this struggle had changed in one important respect during these twenty years. In 1848 the popular movement had been guided by a small group of bourgeois republicans. They also led the resurgence of open republic agitation in Narbonne in the late 1860s when the government of Napoleon III began to loosen its repressive grip on all independent political activity. But after the fall of his regime in September 1870, the alliance between republican notables and the city's popular class fell apart. The Commune of the following spring thus marked the first manifestation of independent republican militancy by Narbonne's popular class. Herein lies the insurrection's importance, but also its weakness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study examined the relationship between scores on components of the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory, the Thurstone Test of Mental Alertness, the Thurstone Temperament Schedule, select demographic data, and successful completion of a paramedic training course.Successful completion was defined as having passed the State Certification Exam with 75% correct in the CPR, Arrthythmia, and General Knowledge sections of the exam. The study also examined the feasibility of prediction of State Exam scores utilitzing a multiple regression analysis. This investigation proposed to examine the effectiveness of selected standardized tests utilized as an alternative screening device for admission to paramedic training programs.The 53 subjects tested were accepted applicants in 3 paramedic training classes. The independent variables were scores on components of the Thurstone Test of Mental Alertness, Thurstone Temperament Schedule, Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory, and select demographic data. The dependent variables were final letter grade received for the training course and scores received on the three sections of the State Certification Exam and the total number correct on the State Exam.Based on the findings of this investigation, it was concluded that:  (1) There was a relationship between test scores and grade in the course and that predictions based upon the four significant, independent variables could be useful as a part of an initial screening process; (2) There was a relationship between test scores and the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) score on the State Certification Exam--predictions based upon the two significant independent variables alone could not be useful in an initial screening process; (3) There was a relationship between test scores, ambulance experience, and arrhythmia score on the State Certification Exam--predictions based upon the four significant, independent variables could be useful as a part of an initial screening process; (4) There was a relationship between test scores and the General Knowledge score on the State Certification Exam--predictions based upon the three significant, independent variables alone could not be useful as an initial screening process; and (5) There was a relationship between test scores and the total number correct on the State certification Exam--predictions based upon the three significant, independent variables alone could not be useful as an initial screening process.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine significant research and writings regarding moral development and moral education as they relate to young adolescents. Three theories relating to the topic were examined: moral inculcation as described by Reo M. Christenson; moral education as proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg; and values clarification as described by Louis Raths, Merrill Harmin, and Sidney Simon.These theories were analyzed with regard to four identified components they shared in common. These elements were: underlying assumptions, choice and judgement, final goals, and instructional models. The theories were critiqued and their common elements reconciled to provide a synthesis. Two perceived deficiencies in each of the three theories were noted. These were: a lack of significant discussion of the affective in relation to moral education; and, a lack of attention to the importance of modeling behavior in the development of moral growth. Based upon the conclusions drawn from the synthesis, a refined model for the moral education of young adolescents was proposed.Finally, several recommendations for further research were offered:  (1) Curricular development of the proposed model; (2) Investigation regarding the inclusion of affective elements in a cognitive moral education model; (3) Further research concerning modeling behavior as it relates to moral education; and, (4) Research regarding the characteristics of the modeling behavior of the instructor in a moral education model.The investigation, its resulting conclusions, and the questions subsequently raised indicate the need for further significant research in an area which has become an increasingly pervasive influence in the lives of young adolescents.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated the relationship between the amount of book reading of adults aged sixty through sixty-four and selected psycholgical, sociological, and environmental variables. In addition, the study investigated the relationship between the sex of these individuals who were identified as minimal, moderate, and avid readers of books and the selected variables.A total of 60 men and 60 women were interviewed with the use of the Adult Inventory of Reading Interests and Attitudes (AIRIA). The subjects were classified as minimal, moderate, and avid readers according to the number of books they had read in a six-month period. Responses to the inventory items concerning the personal history and reading habits of the participants were summarized and reported as raw scores and percentages. The responses to the inventory items concerning selected psychological, sociological, and environmental variables related to reading were analyzed with the use of the chi square statistic in order to determine the level of significance.Significant relationships existed in the following areas: changes in reading preferences over the years, changes in amount of reading during periods of depression, periods of life when more reading occurred than at present, periods of life when less reading occurred than at present, feelings of anxiety or nervousness when reading had not taken place for a period of time, ease with which individuals became interested in reading as compared with formerly, and particular books which caused a change in mind or attitude.Significant relationships also existed in the following areas: desiring to have learned to enjoy reading more during earlier years, exchanging books with another person, reading a book or article because someone had recommended it, reading a book as a result of a suggestion from a radio or television program, having work which requires reading, having been read to during childhood, having read a great deal during childhood, and being able to concentrate on reading.During personal interviews the subjects indicated their awareness of the important role which reading plays in the life of an individual. The concern was expressed by minimal and moderate readers of books that people of all ages need to be helped to enjoy reading.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this historical study was to answer two questions: (1) What has been the impact of Burger Court decisions on public school districts' autonomy in the areas of community relations, personnel, and students? and (2) What has been the basic orientation of the Burger Court in each of these policy areas: judicial activism or support of school district autonomy? Impact was defined as the implications or consequences of a decision of the Supreme Court. Autonomy was defined as a school district's right and authority to determine its own policies and procedures, written or unwritten.Basically all Burger Court cases (1969-1986) concerning public secondary education for which opinions were issued were included in the study. For each case, the issues, facts, decision, and basis for each decision are reported. The impact of Burger Court decisions was summarized according to the issues involved within each major policy area.Included in the Summary chapter is a recapitulation of the impact of the Burger Court in each major policy area. From these implications, a number of general statements are provided to assist school personnel, administrators, and board members in developing (1) good policies, and (2) good practices and procedures. Important observations include: (1) the Court has consistently recognized that Boards of Education are the best bodies to make decisions that affect their constituencies, (2) the Court has consistently recognized the difference between public schools and society at large, (3) the Court has consistently stated that employees and students have a right to due process, (4) school boards have a duty to eliminate all discrimination, (5) only compelling educational interests take precedence over a protected right, and (6) school boards should initiate proactive not reactive policies.Also included was a "Prudent Man Test" for determining which policies or practices are probably acceptable before their implementation. Finally, a number of trends were noted for administrators and board members to consider when developing future policies and procedures.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study consisted of an investigation of the effects of similarity of marital status between subject and recipient (i.e., widowhood vs. divorce), subject's self-esteem (high vs. low), and recipient's locus of dependence (i.e., "internal" dependence, defined as the extent to which those in need had control over the events that promoted their need for help vs. "external" dependence, defined as the extent to which those in need were forced by circumstances to need help) on offers to help. Subject's marital status and subject's self-esteem were the between-subjects factors and recipient's marital status and recipient's locus of dependence were the within-subjects factors. Forty-eight female members of the Parents Without Partners self-help organization were identified as widowed or divorced, and high or low in self-esteem based on questionnaire data.Subjects read four sketches, each of which presented a widowed or a divorced woman (a target) who needed help (e.g., suggestions, emotional support) dealing with one of several different problems (e.g., financial stress, social isolation). In each sketch the target's problem was presented as internally or externally caused. After reading the sketches, subjects rated the targets on nine different 9-point rating scales designed to assess subject's expressed willingness or motivation to offer help (e.g., anchors of "very motivated" or "not very motivated" were used). Data also were obtaned on two rank-order questions concerning offers to help. For purposes of subject selection, additional data were collected regarding subjects' age, level of education, length of widowhood or divorce, and need to nurture.The results indicated a statistially significant interaction between the marital status of the subject and the marital status of the recipient on offers of help. As predicted, widowed subjects were more willing to volunteer help to widowed recipients than to divorced recipients; discrepant from predictions, divorced subjects differed little in their responses to widowed versus divorced recipients. Additional covariate analyses (with similarity ratings as the covariate) were performed to explore further the relationship between similarity and offers to help. Findings of these analyses indicated that while actual similarity (i.e., similarity of marital status) led to greater offers of help by widowed subjects, neither actual nor perceived similarity (i.e., similarity based on some dimension other than marital status) led to greater offers of help by divorced subjects. Also, as predicted, there was a main effect on offers of help for self-esteem; widowed and divorced subjects with high self-esteem volunteered more help to recipients than did their low self-esteem counterparts. Expected differences in the effect of self-esteem on offers to help similar versus dissimilar recipients were not found; i.e., the self-esteem x similarity interaction was non-significant. Finally, as predicted, there was a significant main effect on offers to help for locus of dependence; recipients whose dependence was externally caused received greater offers of help than recipients whose dependence was caused by internal factors. The locus of dependence main effect was explicated by a statistically significant recipient marital status x recipient locus of dependence interaction; divorced subjects volunteered more help to recipients whose dependence was externally versus internally caused, but there were no significant differences between offers of help made by widowed subjects to recipients whose dependence was externally versus intenally caused.In summary, widows' helping was influenced chiefly by similarity of marital status between themselves and the recipients, while divorcees' helping was influenced chiefly by the recipients' locus of dependence. Subjects' self-esteem also influenced volunteering help by both widows and divorcees.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the status of automation in United States community college learning resource centers (LRCs). A survey instrument was developed to gather data in five specific categories: current level of automation, LRC structure, demographic information, future plans for automated services, and attitudes toward or perceived constraints on automated services. The questionnaire was sent to LRC personnel in a sample of 349 United States community colleges (approximately 29 percent of the population). The response rate was 87 percent.The descriptive statistics from this study and the review of literature supported the conclusion that community college LRC programs had not made heavy use of automated services. However, LRC staff were positive and receptive toward automation of services. Fear of automation replacing personnel was not perceived to be a constraint. Respondents indicated that budget has been and will continue to be a major constraint. Institutional priorities were also identified as a constraint on automation of LRC services within community colleges.The structure of LRC programs (integrated versus separate library and audiovisual services) was not significantly related to either current level or future plans for automated services. Not was it related to most measures of attitudes toward or perceived constraints on LRC automation. However, there was a positive relationship between large institutions or LRC programs and current use or future planning for automated services in the LRC. Respondents from larger institutions or LRC programs also tended to have more positive attitudes toward automated services.There was a positive relationship between current involvement with automation or future planning for automation and favorable attitudes toward automation. The lack of current involvement with automation or future planning for automation was significantly related to perceived constraints regarding institutional priorities and budgets.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study concerned the lack of a clear differentiation between the Bayesian and the classical approaches in analyzing research data, especially in the area of:  (a) utilization of prior information, (b) sampling procedure and sample size, and (c) hypothesis testing and interpretation. The purposes of the critical comparison of the classical and Bayesian inferential techniques were:  (a) to confirm and extend theory and empirical knowledge about the use of classical and Bayesian inference in research, (b) to increase awareness among researchers and program evaluators of practical use of Bayesian statistical inference when utility, loss, and decision making are involved, (c) to provide a step by step procedure illustrating the Bayesian statistical operation, so that those who want to apply Bayesian statistics to their research could follow the procedure, and (d) to provide a basic guideline for further comparison of classical and Bayesian inference for more complex models.Six educational research projects were sought from graduate students from various academic departments at Northern Illinois University whose data satisfied the following criteria:  (a) educational research was in process, (b) research data were to be analyzed by an independent model t-test or a zero order Pearson correlational method, and (c) the size of the sample was either relatively large (n &amp;gt; 30) or relatively small (n &amp;lt; 30).After the results from classical statistical analyses were obtained and illustrated, the Bayesian procedure was shown in terms of:  (a) determination of prior parameters, (b) statement of likelihood parameters, (c) calculation of posterior parameters, and (d) utilization of odds ratio and loss ratio for the decision making process. Differences in the results and interpretations were compared and explained in terms of hypotheses formulation, development and weighting of prior information, sampling procedure, credibility intervals, and probabilities of making correct decisions.It was concluded that Bayesian inference is more applicable than classical inference in the following situations:  (a) when the researcher wants to accumulate the numerical value of the parameter of interest and (b) when the researcher wants to utilize the research findings in helping make a decision in terms of loss function.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study attempts to determine the effects of using word-processing equipment in writing instruction. This goal was accomplished by conducting a meta-analysis of the findings of individual studies that compared the quality of writing samples of students using word-processing equipment versus students using traditional writing methods.A thorough computer and bibliography search for experimental studies that could be applied to this meta-analysis yielded over 100 "potential" article titles. After applying specific selection criteria to the studies, only 14 experiments were identified as acceptable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The 14 studies yielded 27 independent effect-size-variable statistics: 12 related to quality, 6 related to attitude, 6 related to essay length, and 3 related to quantity of revisions.Results of the meta-analysis support the following conclusions: (1) There is a small, but significant, improvement in the writing quality of those students using word-processing equipment when compared to those students using traditional writing methods. (2) There are no significant differences in the writing quality among those students using computer-prompted idea-generation word-processing equipment, students using word-processing equipment with text-analysis features, and students using only word-processing equipment. (3) There is no significant difference in the effects of using word-processing equipment on writing quality among inexperienced and experienced student writers. (4) There is a medium, significant, and negative effect in the quantity of revisions performed by students using word-processing equipment and those using traditional writing methods. (5) There is a small, significant, and positive effect in the length of essays produced by students using word-processing equipment and those using traditional writing methods. (6) There is a large, significant, and positive effect on the attitude of students towards writing when using word-processing equipment as compared to students using traditional writing methods.The implications of these findings, as well as recommendations for future research, concluded this study.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research was designed to study teaching method and its influence on achievement on an object assembly posttest. The major question with which this study was concerned was: Among children who are between the ages of 42 and 54 months of age, do those presented the Binomial Cube by either one of two methods or no instruction differ in their ability to perform on a posttest? The two methods selected were: Method A (Montessori, 1967), the ordered presentation of the steps necessary to carry out an activity, and Method B (Hymes, 1968), leading questions designed to cause children to think about the material and the task to be done and come up with the solution to the task. The hypothesis was formulated as follows: There is a significant relationship between method of instruction (Method A, Method B, or control) and object assembly achievement when analyzed by age and sex.Random assignment was used to place willing participants in one of two treatment groups and one control group. The children ranged in age from 42 to 54 months. Thirty children (both boys and girls) were in each of the three groups. The study was conducted in both the Early Childhood Research Laboratory and child care facilities in a small midwestern university community.The researcher used the Posttest-Only Control Group Design as described by Campbell and Stanley (1963). The researcher obtained a list of all subjects available at each site and randomly assigned thirty children to each group; Method A, Method B, or control. In each center a testing area was secured to block the child's vision of other activities so that he was able to attend to the treatment and posttest. The children in both treatment groups were exposed to a method of instruction on the Binomial Cube for 5 minutes. After the time period, the researcher administered the posttest which had a 10 minute time limit. The results were recorded on the data sheets and analyzed by the following statistical procedures: 3 x 2 x 3 factorial analysis of variance and the post hoc Scheffe test.The null hypothesis that there is no significant relationship between method of instruction (Method A, Method B, and control) and object assembly achievement on the posttest when analyzed by age and sex was rejected. The post hoc Scheffe test performed on the group means indicated that children in the Method A group scored significantly higher on the object assembly achievement posttest than the Method B group. The control group's mean posttest score was not significantly different from either the Method A or Method B group. The post hoc test also resulted in the following two statements. The child who was presented with the Binomial Cube by means of the posttest procedure only without treatment was able to put the cube together more correctly than the child who was presented with the Binomial Cube by means of Method B. The child who was presented with the Binomial Cube by means of the posttest procedure only without treatment was not able to put the cube together as correctly as the child who was presented with the Binomial Cube by means of Method A. In both cases, the difference was not statistically significant. It was concluded that the method of instruction was significantly related to the score on the object assembly achievement posttest. In other words, the data suggests that method makes a difference in results. Recommendations for further research on these two methods were presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Partial interval, whole interval, and momentary time-sampling recording procedures were examined to determine the relationship between error in total session duration estimates, interval lengths, and the duration of behavior occurrence. Uniformly distributed data sets of 1,000,000 data points were generated by a computer program for proportions (durations) of 10% through 90%. A second computer program analyzed the data for each of the three recording procedures both with and without a subsequent 10-second recording interval. Results indicate that partial interval recording procedures overestimate the true behavior duration and that whole interval recording procedures underestimate the true behavior duration. Momentary time-sampling was determined to be a representative estimation procedure of the behavior duration. Error was observed to be a function of the duration of behavior, the interval length and the recording rule which governed each time-sampling procedure. For low duration of behavior, whole interval time-sampling was better than partial interval time-sampling (but not as good as momentary time-sampling), with the degree of error increasing with an increase in interval length. For high duration of behavior, partial interval recording was better than whole interval recording (but again, not as good as momentary), with the degree of error again increasing with an increase in interval length. In both conditions, the maximum error possible was observed for the majority of interval lengths. On the other hand, momentary time-sampling was far superior to these two recording procedures not only at these extreme durations but for midrange durations as well; its error was smaller, was not a biased over- or underestimate and was rather consistent for all interval lengths. No important differences were noted in the obtained data between the time-sampling recording durations with or without a 10-second recording interval. Data obtained via time-sampling recording procedures were found to be binomially distributed and controlled by each procedure's recording rule. Partial and whole interval time-sampling must always be, due to their recording rules and binomial probability, very inaccurate estimators of behavioral duration. Momentary time-sampling, on the other hand, must always be, due to its recording rule and binomial probability, an efficient estimator of behavioral duration. These findings strongly suggest that partial and whole interval time-sampling be abandoned as recording procedures and that momentary time-sampling be retained as the only time-sampling procedure which can provide accurate estimates of behavior duration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the study was to examine learner dependency and autonomy by studying conditions under which adults successfully learn second languages. Conditions of learner dependency and autonomy were first identified by Curran (1976) as (a) adult dependency on the language expert; (b) adult resistance to learning in the dependency relationship; and (c) adult anxiety in the face of the strange sounds and structures of the new language. Learning histories of the 51 subjects were obtained through tape recorded oral interviews conducted with the aid of an open-ended 15-item protocol that addressed learner dependency/autonomy as it affected learner motivation, learning progress, and learner attitudes toward the target language and culture. The nonrandom sample was composed of 51 volunteers: 25 American-born adults who learned a foreign language and 26 foreign-born adults who learned English as a second language. Interviews were tape recorded and later edited and transcribed. The edited transcriptions were the principle data of analysis. Successful adult second language learners in this study were both dependent and autonomous in their learning. Those who appeared to be autonomous learners, because their learning was largely informal, were seen to maintain various dependency relationships with resource people and later to have enrolled in formal learning programs where dependency on a language expert was presumed. It was also seen that adult second language learners in formal, dependent learning relationships became autonomous learners when away from the formal learning environment. The most successful adult second language learners in the sample were those who learned a second language to achieve occupational/vocational goals. Learners whose main motive in learning a second language was to survive in the host country were seen to be less successful language learners. The typical successful learner began learning in a formal language program in which there was a high dependency on a language expert to structure the learning activities. The formal learning period was then followed by a long, informal period during which the adult learned more or less independently in a situational context. The findings of the study are summarized in an adult second language learning model which incorporates some theoretical concepts from the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to look at the relationship of preretirement learning and well-being of women in retirement. Specifically, this study asked the questions: Is the perceived well-being of women in retirement greater in those who intentionally seek preretirement learning than in those who do not? Is there a relationship between the kind, specific types of content within preretirement learning programs, and duration of time of preretirement learning and perceived well-being of women in retirement?There was a statistically significant relationship between seminar preretirement learning and perceived well-being of women in retirement. Greater well-being in retirement was reported by women who had chosen seminar as their preretirement learning program. This means of preretirement learning program should be researched further to explore the relationship of an in-depth preretirement learning program and well-being in retirement.Marital status was also statistically significantly related to well-being of women in retirement. Married retirees described themselves as having greater well-being in retirement than any other marital status. The results of the study indicate that it would be useful to study the relationship of how couples prepare for retirement and the effect on well-being in retirement.Most interviewees indicated that they had not intentionally sought preretirement learning, but had relied on their husband's efforts on preretirement learning. Historic life events and prevailing societal attitudes need to be further explored as to their impact on that cohort of women.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine school administrators' perceptions of changes that have occurred in programming, instructional material, and personnel during a period of declining enrollment in the public elementary school districts of suburban Cook County, Illinois. In addition, the data were analyzed by size of school district, location of school district, and job title of administrator.A questionnaire was mailed to administrators from the 115 public elementary school districts in suburban Cook County, Illinois. Responses were returned from 83 (72 percent) administrators.The following conclusions were reported:  (1) Responding school districts experiencing declining enrollment reported that their average class size and their teacher-pupil ratio remained stable; the number of new programs and programs dealing with traditional non-school concerns increased; no particular instructional methodology was utilized as a response to declining enrollment; the existence of surplus space within school buildings led to a perceived improvement in the quality of their educational programming; and there was an overall improvement in the quality of their educational programs. (2) Responding school districts experiencing declining enrollment reported that the replacement cycle of instructional material decreased and the use of teacher-made material decreased. (3) Responding school districts experiencing declining enrollment reported that the number of classroom teachers remained stable; the use of paid para-professionals increased; the use of unpaid volunteers decreased; and there was a slight decrease in student support services provided and the number of persons who worked directly with curriculum excluding classroom teachers.Few significantly different responses were found when the data were analyzed by size of school district, location of school district, and job title of administrator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to determine the actual and desired degree of delegation of authority from boards of trustees to presidents in Illinois public community colleges as perceived by current and former presidents.A review of the literature was conducted to establish the questions in the six decision-making areas of facilities, finance, operations, planning, program, and personnel. The questionnaire was developed, validated by a panel of experts, and mailed to thirty-nine current presidents and thirty-nine former presidents. The response rate was 89.7% for current presidents and 76.9% for former presidents.Data were tested for statistical significance utilizing a Biomedical Computer Program P-Series (BMDP2V) using the .05 level to establish significance. Planned comparisons were used to determine significant differences between mean responses. A simple effects analysis of variance was calculated where significant interactions were found.The key findings were:  (1) current presidents desired significantly more decision-making authority in the area of personnel and significantly less decision-making in the area of program; (2) former presidents desired significantly more decision-making authority in the areas of facilities and operations; (3) all presidents as a group desired significantly more decision-making authority in the areas of facilities, operations and personnel. Presidents desired significantly less decision-making authority in the area of program.Findings with respect to size of institution, status of the president (current or former), or tenure of the president were as follows:  (1) presidents of small colleges desired more decision-making authority in the area of operations as indicated by a significant difference between their responses regarding the actual and desired decision-making authority; (2) current presidents serving more than six years in small colleges desired significantly less decision-making authority in the area of program; (3) all presidents except current versus former presidents serving six years or more in large institutions and current versus former presidents serving five years or less in small institutions showed significant differences regarding actual authority in the area of program; (4) nine of the twelve categories for all presidents showed significant differences indicating that they desired less decision-making authority in the area of program.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of the study was to describe and analyze the admissions requirements, program requirements, degree emphases, enrollment data, faculty data, program features, and curricula of instructional technology graduate degree programs.Data for the study were gathered by a questionnaire distributed to 194 identified institutions. A 100 percent response was obtained.An analysis of the data provided the following conclusions. The number of programs increased from 50 in 1955 to 193 in 1980. The degrees offered and the programs have continued to be located within the school/college of education. Departmental names have fluctuated and the number of descriptors used has increased.A majority of the programs required the Graduate Record Exam and an undergraduate/graduate grade point average for admissions. The majority of all three degree levels required a minimum number of credit hours, a maximum time allocation for degree completion, and a comprehensive examination.The major emphases of the master's programs were materials production and utilization/application. The six-year degree emphasized management/administration. The doctorate emphases were research, instructional development, theory, evaluation, and instructional systems design.The masters had the greatest number of student enrollments. In all three degree levels, student majors were greater than the number of student minors and the number of part-time students was greater than the number of full-time students. The master's level had the greatest number of foreign and out-of-state students and total graduates.There were 788 full-time and 469 part-time faculty members identified. The largest percent of the full-time faculty held the professor's rank and a doctorate degree. The majority of programs offered state certification and financial assistance.All 193 programs offered at least one course in the management/administration, production, and utilization of media. The mean number of courses offered was 17.3 courses per program.Recommendations included that a thorough survey of all instructional technology graduate degree programs be conducted annually. Common descriptors need to be utilized for the profession's identity. Administrators and faculty of the programs need to assume an effective leadership role in the direction of the profession.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1935, a national organization entitled the School Public Relations Association was formed to promote the study of school-community relations by professional educators. In 1950, this organization merged with the National Education Association (NEA) and changed its name to the National School Public Relations Association (NSPRA). Although NSPRA is no longer associated with NEA, it has continued to expand as an organization over the past three decades.This study examined the publications of NSPRA from 1950 through June of 1987 and compared these with publications in the area of school-community relations published by other sources over the same time span, to the end that similar and dissimilar writing trends could be discerned. Certain conclusions were also drawn in regard to writing trends which appeared popular in certain years as opposed to others. A questionnaire, sent to past and present officials of NSPRA, was also employed.The findings of the study show that both NSPRA and non-NSPRA sources emphasized certain writing topics in the same years in some instances, while not in others, and that some writing topics appeared to be generated by historical events. Additionally, it appeared evident that NSPRA has held a broader view of what constitutes the subject of school-community relations than may be generally held by many educators.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study investigated the process and impact of closing a large comprehensive high school. The specific research questions that the study addressed were:  (1) What were the elements of the plan to close a large comprehensive high school? (2) What were the communication processes used to carry out a school closing plan? (3) What impact does a school closing have on the school publics (students, parents, teachers, and administrators) involved? The first two research questions were historical in nature and answered in narrative form. The third research question was descriptive in nature and was addressed by administering an instrument to administrators, parents, teachers, and students.The sample for the study was drawn from a population of former Niles East students, teachers, parents of East students, and district administrators.Findings of the study include the following:(1) The elements of the plan to close a large comprehensive high school were:  (A) The thorough analysis of district information. (1) review of fiscal position. (2) demographic analysis of population. (3) review of public hearing communication. (B) The Board of Education Position Statement. (C) The Board adopted a plan for closing Niles East School. (D) The Board delegation of responsibilities to superintendent. (E) The Board formalized a plan by adopting superintendent recommendations.(2) The communication processes that were used to carry out a school closing plan were:  (A) A written charge stated by superintendent. (B) Delineation of authority and channels for implementation. (C) Defined structure for deletions, revisions, and additions. (D) Status reports. (E) Board recognition of accomplishment and completion.(3) The impact of closing a high school on the publics involved were:  (A) That district administrators overwhelmingly endorsed the plan. (B) That parents agreed with the decision to close a high school. (C) That teachers endorsed the decision to close a high school. (D) That students disagreed with the decision to close the high school. (E) That all four publics agreed that the quality of education in Niles Township had been maintained with the closing of East. (F) That all four publics agreed that the plan used to close Niles East met the needs of the district.There was overall agreement that the closing of Niles East High School did not have a negative impact on any of the four publics.</dc:description>

<dc:title>ORDER AND PROGRESS:  THE REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY OF ALBERTO J. PANI.</dc:title>

<dc:description>This study examines the world view of Alberto J. Pani, an influential Revolutionary policy maker in Mexico from 1910 to 1933. An investigation of Pani's world view, the study suggests, may therefore provide insights into the nature of Revolutionary ideology in general--an ideology which historians traditionally have misunderstood when they have not denied its existence altogether.The work of Auguste Comte and Ernest Renan was influential in the formation of Pani's world view. Pani, like Comte and Renan, rejected the traditional wisdom of laissez-faire capitalist development which they regarded as dangerously unstable. Instead he counseled class cooperation and State regulation of the private developmental process. Government intervention in the economy was central to the task of reconciling Progress with Order--dynamic private economic development with a stable capitalist social order.Pani aimed to institutionalize his concern for order and progress by reorganizing the Mexican educational system. He also organized the Confederacion de Camaras Nacionales de Comercio, the Confederacion de Camaras Industriales and the Convencion Bancaria in an effort to develop a national business consensus on the political, economic and social needs of private entrepreneurial development. Similarly, he developed and administered economic and fiscal policy from 1923 to 1926 designed to stimulate private investment and to stabilize the Mexican economy. The Banco de Mexico was created to mobilize, organize and discipline Mexican financial resources. Pani also negotiated with foreign bankers to reduce the share of government budgets devoted to external debt service, thereby freeing national revenues for investment in infrastructural development projects that were central to long-term economic growth. Moreover, Pani was willing to sacrifice the immediate interests of particular individuals or groups if the general long-term needs of private entreprenuerial development required it. The subordination of individual interests to national development needs therefore required the "depoliticization" of government policy formulation. In Pani's view, political democracy--insofar as it permitted popular input into policy making--was simply incompatible with the stable development of private enterprise in Mexico.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Professional nurses make up a large segment of the adult learner population. Only a small portion of professional nurses pursue advanced formal education as a part of their lifelong learning activities. The purpose of this study was to identify select factors that influenced a group of professional nurses in the pursuance of lifelong learning.Research questions posed for the study focused on the source of lifelong learning; role of the pre-service curriculum in developing and nurturing lifelong learning; professional role expectations; effects of mentoring/role modeling; presence or lack of support systems; and primary benefits derived from continuing learning.A grounded theory methodology was used. Purposeful sampling was conducted through the process of nomination. Using characteristics based on A.M. Tough's "high learners" (as described in 1971), 23 professional nurses nominated by their peers agreed to participate. Constant comparative analysis was used to code the data collected through interviews. Six categories and their properties were identified: Intrapersonal; Socialization/Developmental, Socialization/Professional; Enrichments; Restraints; and Empowerment. Socialization emerged as the integrating concept.Nominees identified the source of lifelong learning as coming from the self, parents, and family. The curriculum aspect was found to be a more dominant factor at the graduate level where mentors were a prominent support system. Professional role expectations were identified as a major learning stimulus, although this group of "high learners" followed a more atypical pattern of continuing learning than the average professional nurse. Major restraining factors were self-limitations and the balancing of multiple social roles, much like other women in society today. All nominees experienced a sense of empowerment as a result of their learning activities which enhanced self-actualization and contributed to an enabling, liberating process.Two major propositions were developed: (1) Lifelong learning is a value developed very early in life through a supportive family environment as part of the socialization process and is strengthened in the professional educational program (nursing). (2) The major outcome of lifelong learning for the professional nurse is an expanded personal and professional knowledge and understanding of self that provides a source of empowerment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Research comparing motion and still pictures has had conflicting results. A better method for evaluating various media is necessary. Psychophysiological instrumentation, albeit available, is underutilized in its applications to education and educational communications. To date, no research has been conducted which measures the ability of mental concentration in the comparison of different media characteristics such as motion picture and still pictures. Mental concentration in human beings is indicated by the presence of beta brain wave. The research problem in this study was to establish the comparative effects of motion pictures versus still pictures on learner's E.E.G.The purpose of this study was to measure and analyze viewers' electroencephalographic reactions to the audiovisual formats of videotape (motion and slide/audiotape still).The subjects for the study were 60 randomly selected students from Speech 100, a lower division general education course in the Department of Speech Communication at Northern Illinois University. Subjects were selected from the Speech 100 population of 1,128 students registered during the semester in which the experiment was conducted.The motion variable was represented by a videotape which explained the use of a Sony three-quarter inch VO1600 videocassette recorder. The still variable was represented by a slide/audiotape program which also explained the use of the Sony videocassette recorder. The materials were field tested and reviewed by a panel of media experts to establish validity.The experimental session was divided into five parts: verbal information to the subject, application of electrodes, adjustment period, treatment session, and removal of the electrodes from the subject. The data were collected within the framework of a counterbalanced research design. Experimental control was maintained by giving both treatments to each subject in alternating order. The statistical procedure used to analyze the data was the t-test, for both correlates and independent groups. Data collected in this experiment could not be thought of as a "score" on a test. But rather, the collected data are an average of microvolt seconds of electricity produced by the brain.Results of the experiment supported the retention of the null hypothesis, that no significant difference existed between groups who were shown the motion picture program and the still picture program.</dc:description>
