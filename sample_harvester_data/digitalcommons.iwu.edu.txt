			<dc:title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reactions of Aziridino-Olefins</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tymonko &#39;01, Steven</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Electrophilic reactions resulting in the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds are important tools in organic synthesis. For example, the acid catalyzed cyclization of epoxy olefins has been well documented, while similar cyclizations with aziridines have been largely unexplored. The aim of this project is to develop and demonstrate the formation of a carbocyclic compound from aziridino-olefins utilizing a Lewis acid to catalyze the cyclization. In working toward this goal, a number of aziridino-olefins were synthesized from isoprenoid start materials. These aziridino-olefins were then reacted with both Lewis and protic acids in an attempt to induce cyclization. As a result, we have demonstrated the formation of both the desired carbocyclic products as well as competing cyclizations to oxazoline products.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Green Chemistry Using Bismuth Salts Bismuth (III) Iodide Catalyzed Deprotection of Acetals and Ketals in H2O</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bailey &#39;07, Aaron D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Since the Pollution Prevention Act was passed in 1990, synthetic organic chemists have focused on the use of environmentally friendly reagents. Often, many synthetic labs use metal catalysts (compounds containing Hg, Ni, Pb, &#38; Sn) that are toxic to or have detrimental effects on the environment. Unlike many heavy metal compounds, bismuth and its compounds have been found to be relatively non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the f electrons bismuth compounds have been shown to be efficient Lewis acid catalysts for many reactions.
The goal of this project to utilize bismuth compounds, specifically bismuth(III) iodide, as catalysts for the deprotection of acetals in water. Water is an attractive solvent because it is inexpensive, non-toxic, and non-flammable. The deprotections of cyclic and acyclic acetals and ketals were carried out in good yields using catalytic amounts of bismuth(III) iodide. Furthermore, it has been observed that these reactions exhibit chemoselectivity, for e.g. an acetal can be selectively cleaved in the presence of a TBDMS (tert-butyldimethyl silyl) group.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nitrite Photochemistry in 2-Propanol/Water Solution</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Binder &#39;04, Joseph B.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nitrite ion, a component of nitrogen oxide pollution, is an important source of free radicals in the environment. N02- absorbs ambient ultraviolet light to break into NO and 0-, and in environmental conditions, 0- is converted to hydroxyl radical, OH. Hydroxyl radical reacts with a wide variety of environmental pollutants, including hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, so its sources are of interest to environmental chemists. In order to investigate the processes of nitrite photochemistry, nitrite ion was photolyzed at 366 nm in 2-propanol/water solution. This mixed solvent system allows investigation of the effects of varying the solvent cage composition and scavenger concentration on the photolysis process and OH production in particular. A secondary goal was to follow nitrite ion and OH scavenging product concentrations simultaneously. OH radicals were scavenged by 2-propanol to form acetone, which was quantified by derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine followed by HPLC detection. Acetone yields were compared to nitrite disappearance quantified by ultraviolet spectroscopy for nitrite ion photolyses in 96/4, 98/2, and 100/0 mass/mass 2-propanol/water solutions. Acetone was formed at a higher rate in the 100% 2-propanol solvent, suggesting a shift in mechanism at much lower water concentrations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Photochemistry of Nitrous Acid in an Aqueous Matrix</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ratliff &#39;03, Jay S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The thermal and photochemical decomposition of aqueous solutions of nitrous acid and nitrite ion were studied, with a focus on the production and subsequent reaction of hydroxyl radicals. The production of these radicals in aqueous solution may be determined indirectly by disappearance of nitrous acid, or more directly by their interaction with a radical scavenger. Benzene was used to scavenge hydroxyl radical and the products of reactions with hydroxyl radical as well as nitrous acid were characterized. The roles of temperature and dissolved gases were also examined.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Environment Friendly Organic Synthesis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith &#39;04, Russell C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In recent years, chemists have increasingly focused on environment friendly approaches to organic chemistry. By practicing Green Chemistry, chemists are attempting to reduce the use of hazardous materials and minimize waste. Green chemistry, which involves the design and some times redesign of chemical syntheses that are more environmentally friendly, attempts to lower risk by using inherently less toxic or non-toxic reagents.
The goal of this research was to (1) investigate the use of bismuth triflate as a catalyst for resorcinarene formation as well as the synthesis of homoallyl ethers and (2) to investigate the utility of ionic liquids as solvents for a one-pot synthesis of homoallyl ethers. Bismuth triflate is an attractive Lewis acid catalyst because it is relatively non-toxic, is inexpensive and is easy to handle. Bismuth triflate (5 mol %) has been shown to catalyze the condensation of resorcinol with various aldehydes to form the corresponding resorcinarene in good yield. This method is attractive because of the fast reaction times and the use of a non-toxic catalyst. Studies were also conducted to better understand the mechanism of resorcinarene formation as well as the conformational changes that these compounds can undergo.
A bismuth triflate catalyzed one-pot synthesis of homoallyl ethers from the corresponding aldehydes has also been developed. This method allows the direct conversion of an aldehyde to the corresponding homoallyl ether without the need for isolation and purification of the acetal intermediate.
Another area of focus for the Green Chemistry movement is the replacement of volatile organic solvents. Most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone. Ozone is a very irritating pollutant that produces symptoms like coughing and reduced lung function. Therefore, the reduction of these vapors in the lower atmosphere is desired. Ionic liquids seem to be the most promising replacement for VOCs in organic chemistry. Ionic liquids are defined as ionic compounds that are liquids at or near room temperature. Due to their ionic nature, these compounds have practically zero-vapor pressure and therefore they do not pose any respiratory problems. The utility of ionic liquids as solvents has been explored in the one-pot synthesis of homoallyl ethers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Are Nutrients assimilated by juveniles of the brittle star Amphipholis squamata (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea)?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Whitehill &#39;05, Elizabeth A.G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Over 50 species of brittle stars (Echinodennata: Ophiuroidea) are known to brood their developmental stages (embryos and larvae) through metamorphosis in internal structures called bursae (Hyman, 1955). In some of these brooding ophiuroids, the source of the organic material necessary to support the growth and development of the embryos is somewhat obscure because the amount of material required is not maternally supplied in the egg. A species that follows this example is Amphipholis squamata (Delle Chiaje). Previous studies (Fontaine and Chia 1968) have shown that the larvae of A. squamata are able to acquire the organic material needed to sustain growth from simple carbohydrates and amino acids dissolved in the surrounding environment. However, the amount of nutrition provided by these molecules is probably not enough to sustain the growth that the larvae exhibit before they are released as juveniles. This study examined the uptake of high molecular weight organic molecules (polysaccharides and polypeptides), sources that are more likely to provide sufficient energy for growth. The data collected suggest that the juveniles do not readily absorb polysaccharides but do actively take up polypeptides which could then be broken down and used for growth.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Attitudes and Intentions of Students Regarding Future Alumni Activity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Atwood &#39;04, Amy K.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Director of Alumni Relations at a small, liberal-arts university in the Midwest approached a university marketing professor about investigating student attitudes and intentions regarding future alumni activity. Information collected from preliminary focus groups helped in the creation of a attitudes and intentions survey given to 322 students. Results showed that students seemed knowledgeable about the fundraising needs of the university, but lacked sophistication about these needs. A targeted marketing campaign aimed at improving students&#39; level of sophistication shows great potential for altering the apathetic attitudes some students have about donating back to their alma mater. Due to the lack of relevant literature on the topic and the serious need for increased funds at all universities, these results may aid university management in increasing finances from alumni.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Privatization in Lithuania: General Environment and Case Studies</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sabaliauskaite &#39;00, Ginte</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The crumble of the Soviet Union left Lithuania, like many of its former republics, at a standstill. With the demise of USSR came the demise of markets in the east and it became important for Lithuania to establish economic ties with the west. The first step in this direction is to privatize much of the public property so that it can be managed with a goal of profitability. The privatization of housing and small firms is very important, but the successful privatization of large enterprises plays a crucial role in the country&#39;s overall economic success. Profitability of a large enterprise affects directly the GDP, standards of living, distribution of income and unemployment in countries such as Lithuania which in size barely equal the state of Georgia. In this paper, I will attempt to demonstrate that successful privatization depends on the following four conditions: the competitiveness in international markets and existence of domestic markets, method of privatization, corruption issues, and the role of the IMF. Further, I will show the effects of these conditions specifically in the past privatization experiences of three such large firms in Lithuania. Lastly, I will measure the success of privatization in each firm based on the number of jobs created or saved, profitability of the firm, progress in modernization and investment in infrastructure.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Baseball and Its Anti-Trust Exemption</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Korczak &#39;04, Jason</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Somewhere in small town America there is a group of young boys with an old tattered ball and a game tested Louisville Slugger playing a pick up game of baseball. It doesn&#39;t matter that there is no crowd cheering them on, or that none of the players have a uniform, or even that not one of them is being paid. All of these youngsters are playing simply for the love of the game. And this is how the majority of people in America view baseball, as a game that people play for fun and enjoyment. This is not the case however, with the select few that are talented enough to play baseball professionally. Their reasons for playing go further than their passion for the game; they also make a living by playing. So, to some, these rare athletic marvels could be said to view the game as a business. Just as in any other business, these workers are paid to perform a service and, since their craft is in high demand, some are paid well. These two contrasting situations, though, present a problem: should baseball be considered a game or a business? As a legal matter, that question was answered by the United States Supreme Court. And since the Court&#39;s 1922 decision, America&#39;s Pastime has never been the same. It is likely that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes had no idea what sort of impact his ruling of baseball as an exhibition would have, but some eighty years later we are still feeling the ripples from this drop in the pond.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Brown-headed Cowbird Brood Parasitism in Bison-grazed and Ungrazed Tallgrass Prairie</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Latham &#39;00, Alexandra C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater has long been associated with bison (Bos bison) in North America on the Great Plains (Friedmann 1929). As a result, I anticipated that cowbirds would parasitize host nests more frequently in the presence of bison than in their absence. I predicted that several common ground-nesting avian species, Dickcissels (Spiza americana), Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), would suffer higher frequencies of brood parasitism in bison-grazed habitat than in ungrazed habitat on the tallgrass Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, located in northeastern Kansas. The frequency of cowbird parasitism for all species combined was significantly higher in bison-grazed (0.69) than in ungrazed habitat (0.44) (p =0.044, X2 = 4.061, df =1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis and suggestion that bison-grazed habitat may be a more optimal site for cowbird brood parasitism than ungrazed habitat. I pose two principal explanations for the higher frequency of parasitism observed in the bison-grazed area. First, cowbirds may be able to forage more efficiently in the bison-grazed area, indirectly inflating parasitism frequencies by conferring a variety of energetic and nutritional advantages upon the females. Second, the cowbirds&#39; abilities to find and parasitize nests may be enhanced by the shorter, less dense grass characteristic of grazed habitat. Further studies investigating the conservation implications of this phenomenon are merited.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Systematic Relationships of Natalid and Furipterid Bats, Based on Hyoid Morphology (Chiroptera: Natalidae and Furipteridae)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Baxi &#39;01, Kosha N.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Themusculature of the hyoid regions of two species of bats (Order Chiroptera) from two separate families, Natalidae and Furipteridae, were examined using standard microscopic dissection techniques. Morphological variation was described and characters were scored and entered into the computer program PAUP, Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, along with characters of families previously examined by Griffiths. Cladistic analysis revealed support for the placement of Natalidae and Furipteridae together within the Superfamily Nataloidea, along with the families Thyropteridae and Myzopodidae, as recently proposed by Simmons (1998). The inclusion of Myzopodidae is surprising from a geographical standpoint. Myzopodids are endemic to Madagascar, while thyropterids, natalids and furipterids are found in Central America and northern South America. Thus, the placement of the Myzopodidae with the other three sympatric families implies that all four of these, families share an unknown common ancestor in Africa, perhaps an unknown fossil species of bats.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Development and Structure of Feeding Arms in Antarctic Species of Pterobranchs (Pterobranchia, Hemichordata)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Krahe &#39;06, Catherine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Pterobranchs are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists because as members of the phylum Hemichordata, they share characteristics with vertebrate animals and other chordates. The focus of this study is an examination of the development, structure, and function of the feeding arms in several species of pterobranchs collected from depths greater than 500 m from waters surrounding Antarctica. Pterobranch zooids in the genus Cephalodiscus feed using a crown of arms held over the dorsal surface of the body to filter particles from the water. Larvae released from adult tubes are ciliated, but lack feeding arms and are thought to derive energy from internal yolk stores. However, we have observed larvae of at least one species respond to the presence of particulate food, suggesting that these developmental forms may feed without the aid of adult structures. The feeding arms develop on the dorsal side of the animal, often beginning with a pair near the central axis followed by pairs of arms to the left and right. Each arm develops from a trilobed bud. The adult feeding apparatus consists of up to twelve arms held in a sphere on the dorsal side of the animal. Each arm has multiple tentacles, which are paired along the length of the arm until the apical-most tip. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that a single tentacle has two tracts of cilia along its outer face which may beat to draw water across the tentacular net or capture food particles. Food particles, including bacteria and single-celled algae, may then be conveyed down the tentacle to a deep, thickly ciliated groove on the outer face of the arm central to the paired tentacles, and eventually to the mouth. Scanning electron and light microscopy have elucidated the structures associated with feeding, as well as unusual refractive spheres at the tip of each arm in some species.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Taxonomic Study of the Lichen Genera Canomaculina, Canoparmelia and Rimelia in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Boente &#39;05, Erin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The 1997 National Park Service checklist of lichen species in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) included only two Rimelia species (R. reticulata and R. subisidiosa), two Canoparmelia species (C  caroliniana and C crozalsiana) and one Canomaculina species (as Rimeliella subtinctorium). Previous field and laboratory work by Jonathan Dey, often with Illinois Wesleyan University undergraduate student assistants, pointed to the presence of additional species of Rimelia in the GSMNP. Thus, we examined all specimens of Rimelia, Canoparmelia and Canomaculina previously collected in the GSMNP and deposited in the lichen herbarium at Illinois Wesleyan University in order to update the species list for the park for these three genera.
As a result of this study, five species of Rimelia are now known to occur in the GSMNP. R. commensurata and R. simulans are newly reported in the park to go with Rimelia cetrata (noted in the 2005 version of the checklist) and the previously known R. reticulata and R. subisidiosa. Rimelia diffractaica occurs in the Southern Appalachian Mountain regions but has not yet been found in the park. Canoparmelia amabilis is tentatively added to the species checklist for the park bringing the total Canoparmelia species to three-C. amabilis, C. caroliniana and C crozalsiana. Canomaculina subtinctoria remains the only Canomaculina species reported in the park.
Descriptions of the genera, keys to the species in each genus, and species descriptions are presented. Data include morphological characters, secondary product chemistry, local ecology, general distribution, GSMNP distribution map, and a list of specimens examined for each species. Data from IWU herbarium specimens of related species that occur in the southeastern United States are also presented. Some of these species might one day be found in the park.
This study is a part of the All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI) of the GSMNP, a large endeavor where scientists and educators are working collaboratively to determine all the organisms that can be found in the park.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Relationship Between Economic Freedom and Soci-Economic Development</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Madan &#39;02, Anisha</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The concept of economic freedom is not a novel one in economic theory. Since the time of Adam Smith, if not before, economists have believed that the freedom to choose and supply resources, compete in business, trade with others, and secure property rights are central ingredients of economic progress (North and Thomas, 1973). Adam Smith (1776-1937) explained how the invisible hand of the marketplace enhanced the wealth of nations. David Ricardo (1821-1912) advocated free trade as a means of producing economic growth. Milton Friedman said, &#34;I believe that free societies have arisen and persisted only because economic freedom is so much more productive economically than other methods controlling economic activity&#34; (Foreword in Gwartney et al., 1996).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jbara &#39;07, Brian W.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In recent years, increased economic development, globalization, and liberalization of international trade have been linked by economists and environmental scholars as possible causes for specific trends in pollution. One of the most studied and controversial hypotheses is the Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis (EKC), which states that a country&#39;s pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a certain point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations again. If true, plotting pollution concentrations against income per capita will yield an inverted V-the EKC. Another controversy is the manner in which the more affluent countries reduce their pollution concentrations. Two possibilities are likely: One is that the more developed countries adopt cleaner technologies to produce their goods. The other less hopeful possibility is that developed countries simply specialize more and more in the production of products of cleaner industries, while the less affluent or developing countries take over production of products from dirtier industries. This suggests that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries. This is the essence of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH). This paper looks for evidence of an EKC across 36 countries over time. It also looks for evidence as to whether these changes over time are consistent with the PHH. Sulfur Dioxide (S02) is used as a measure of pollution concentrations for the EKC, while five dirty manufacturing industries are used to measure the level of dirty trade in developed and developing countries. Linear regression models and descriptive statistics are utilized. Overall, there is very little evidence to suggest that an EKC exists. There is no evidence to support the PHH.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Supply and Demand Factors on the Affordability of Rental Housing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davenport &#39;03, Jamie L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The difficulty of acquiring affordable rental units remains the most significant concern for low-income households. Despite the strong economic growth of the 1990s, one-third of all households spend more than the recommended thirty percent of their incomes on rental costs. These cost-burdened households face diminishing affordable rental units due to gentrification, rental rates increasing faster than real incomes, and the expiration of government subsidized rental units. The rental market is the focus of this paper since low-income households face the greatest barriers to acquiring affordable housing.  This paper uses an empirical analysis of the supply and demand factors affecting affordability as measured by the percentage of cost-burdened households in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). The cross-sectional OLS regression uses data from 131 MSAs nationwide to examine the effects of household median income, fair market rents, population change, rental vacancy rates, percentage change in rental units, percentage of low-and high-income households, and percentage of low-rent or subsidized units. The results indicate the significance of income levels and demonstrate the need for increased effectiveness of housing policy to make housing more affordable to low-income households.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Monopsony Power in Major League Baseball on the Salaries of Players with Less Than Six Years in the Majors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tarman &#39;05, Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research attempts to measure the impact of monopsony power on baseball players with less than six years of experience. Past research indicates that players with less than six years of experience have lower salaries than players with the same productivity and more than six years of experience. To try and combat monopsonistic behavior, baseball player&#39;s formed the Players&#39; Union and instituted an arbitration process. Through this process, a third party arbitrator listens to cases from both a player and owner and then chooses either the player&#39;s or the owner&#39;s salary bid. While this process is intended to help players gain market power, it is still unclear whether the actual process is effective. Therefore, it is important to evaluate trends in players&#39; salaries before, during, and after arbitration in order to see if further changes in the arbitration process need to be made.
To do this, 19 outfielders who have filed for and received an arbitration hearing during the time frame of 1990-2003 are examined following their career throughout their pre-arbitration (first three years), arbitration year (after third year), and post-arbitration years (after fourth year on). By using the human capital model, three ratios of the players&#39; actual salaries during these years to a predicted free agent salary are estimated. The prediction that the ratios should increase throughout these three periods, due to the fact that the players gain more market power, is supported by the results. In fact, the ratios of actual to predicted salary increase from 0.27 in pre-arbitration years, to 0.97 in the arbitration year, to over 1.2 in post-arbitration years. This indicates that the players face substantial monopsony power in the pre-arbitration year followed by a decrease in monopsony power through the arbitration process and post-arbitration years.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>High School Dropout Determinants: The Effect of Socioeconomic Status and Learning Disabilities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ingrum &#39;06, Adrienne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Considering the growing importance of higher education due to increased global competition, one might wonder why some students still opt to drop out of high school. Previous literature has focused on a number of determinants of high school dropouts, such as socioeconomic status and learning disabilities. However, this literature has not systematically explored the interaction between these two variables. Therefore, my research extends past literature by focusing on this interaction. A logit model is used to predict the dichotomous variable, high school dropouts, and to run simulations with varying values of the independent variables. The results show that low socioeconomic status, learning disabilities, and most importantly the interaction between these two variables increase the likelihood of dropping out of high school for students facing these challenges. .</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Team Success and Personnel Allocation under the National Football League Salary Cap</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Haugen &#39;06, John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A pre-Super Bowl article published in the Wall Street Journal labels the personnel spending and business model of the Seattle Seahawks, the National Football Conference representative to Super Bowl XL, as &#34;extraordinary.&#34; Much to the surprise of the author, &#34;they plucked their entire defense from the discount bins&#34; and still made it to the Super Bowl (Walker 2006). Seattle spent far less on its defense in comparison not only to their Super Bowl opponents, the Pittsburgh Steelers, but compared to every single other NFL team. They valued &#34;underpriced or underappreciated players who were as long on character and potential as they were short on intimidating size and athleticism&#34; (Walker 2006). The success of this previously underemployed and ineffective method confounded many familiar with the game. The consensus among scholars of the game was the old adage that &#34;defense wins championships&#34; but Seattle had intentionally bought its defense at the Dollar General. This paper analyzes the heart of this issue: can a team really influence its success based on how it allocates its salary to its players? Is there a &#34;natural&#34; allocation strategy inherent to the NFL and its teams that yields a successful team? In short, does spending more money to upgrade the talent of certain positions yield more team success?</dc:description>

<dc:description>I use a hedonic pricing model to analyze which characteristics consumers are willing to pay more for, and to determine whether consumers are willing to pay more for one specific brand name when all other factors are held constant. Section II of this paper reviews previous research on demand for automobiles. Section III develops the theory, Section IV explains the empirical model, including the data set, Section V discusses the results, and Section VI concludes with suggestions for future research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of CEO Compensation Structure on Reported Earnings and Shareholder Wealth</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Blumer &#39;03, Kory J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Corporate executives are paid at extremely high levels compared to lower-level employees, especially in the United States, and their level of compensation usually does not change based on company performance with respect to competitors, but rather with changes in their company&#39;s stock price. It is well known that executive compensation among U.S. corporations is comprised mostly of stock options, sometimes up to 90% of overall compensation (Edgar 2002). These stock options allow executives, namely chief executive officers (CEOs), to cash in big bucks during good times and risk zero losses during bad times.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Case of the Phillips Curve in the Formation of a Monetary Union</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wen Wan &#39;01, Yuet</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The European Monetary Union was established in 1992 as part of an effort to bring economic integration to new levels by creating a common currency area for Europe -a monetary union that would abolish transaction costs of converting one European currency to another, and eliminating exchange rate variability and uncertainty among traders and investors. Since the formation of the European Monetary System in 1979, lowering inflation had become the main monetary policy priority. My research centers on the Phillips Curve, which implies that decreasing inflation rates would always be coupled with increasing unemployment rates. This study uses the trends of inflation and unemployment in these countries to test the validity of the Phillips Curve. Regression analysis found that inflation had a significant inverse relationship with unemployment. Further analysis found that the institutional effort towards disinflation during the implementation of the European Monetary System was a major cause of increasing unemployment in the 1980s -1990s.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Czech Voucher Privatization: A Case of Decision Making Under Uncertainty</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hristova &#39;02, Katia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Voucher privatization, a kind of large-scale privatization, was of special importance. It was conducted by the Czech Government in order to redistribute property among the population in a situation of complete lack of domestic private capital. All citizens over the age of 18 had the opportunity to obtain a voucher book. However, by providing little information about the process, the Government was really aiming only at the knowledgeable citizens who would be successful entrepreneurs. Voucher privatization was also thought of as a way to speed up the transition in the economy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Market Concentration: The Effects of Technology</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Janashvili &#39;02, David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Market concentration is often viewed as an important indicator of monopoly power, which makes it a key aspect for analyzing antitrust and other cases. A good understanding of what market concentration is and how it arises is crucial to policy decision making, especially in today&#39;s world where large corporations often tend to dominate the business scene. In this paper I investigate how factors accounting for technological change affect market concentration holding constant the effects of other recognized determinants of concentration.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Gender Wage Ratio: Does it Differ Between Races?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kirkpatrick &#39;06, Britanny</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In 1964 the Civil Rights Act made it illegal for employers to discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (Coleman, 2003). This act was passed to help bring equality to men and women of all races; however, a gender wage gap still exists. Up until the 1970s it was estimated that women made only 60% compared to their male counterparts in earnings. Since then the wage difference between men and women has continually decreased due to the large number of women entering the labor force, the outlawing of gender discrimination, and an increase in the number of women attending colleges and professional schools (Stone, 2004). According to Blau, in 2003 women earned 76% of men&#39;s wages (2006).
An even more interesting aspect of the gender wage gap is the way it differs between blacks and whites. For instance, in 1975 white women earned 42.5% less than white men, while today white women earn only 21 % less than white men (Green, 2005). Similarly, black women also earn less than black men, but not by as much of a margin. In fact, in 1975 black women earned 24.9% less than black men and in 2003 they earned only 10.7% less (Green, 2005). Although there have been many studies to understand why the gender wage gap exists, there have been few studies done to understand how the gap differs across racial groups and the role that labor force attachment plays in explaining the female-male wage ratio.
This study examines the effects of labor force attachment in determining wages for black women, black men, white women, and white men. It follows a cohort of black and white men and women from 1980 through 2002 in order to explore the effect of labor force attachment on the female-male wage ratio. Section II reviews the related literature, section III explains the empirical model, section IV reveals the results, and section VI conducts counterfactual analysis ofthe results.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Language Deficiency and the Occupational Attainment of Mexican Immigrants</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Planas &#39;05, Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The number of Mexican immigrants that have entered the U.S. has greatly increased over the past decade. The occupational attainment of these immigrants provides insight into how successful they are in the host country and language deficiency has an effect on this occupational attainment. By controlling for language proficiency, human capital characteristics and other variables from the IPUMS database, this project uses probit analysis to predict the probability that an immigrant will be employed in a favorable occupation in the u.s. Results show that language deficiency reduces the probability of attaining a favorable occupation, but having no English language skills decreases the probability by a lesser amount than if the immigrant had any English language skills. This information is important to the analysis of immigration policy and to language training for immigrants in the United States.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of the Federal Income Tax Structure and Social Security on the Changing US Family Composition</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gray &#39;06, Adam M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>From dual-earner, married couples, to opposite and same-sex cohabitation, America&#39;s family structure, lifestyles, and attitudes have been changing in recent years. This paper provides a framework of understanding how families interact and make economic decisions. It examines whether external and internal benefits to family formation exist. The government should develop policies are both equitable and efficient depending on what benefits exist for society, if any. Currently, one of the biggest gains married partners make occurs within the Federal Income Tax and Social Security Systems. However, this structure was created at a time when families were very traditional-a working husband and childrearing, non-working wife. This structure will be simulated to show how America&#39;s changing family structures are being affected by this obsolescent model. Results provide evidence that more and more families are becoming economically disadvantaged because they do not get the same tax incentives and benefits that married, traditional families do.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Is There Assessor Bias in the Real Estate Market?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Howard &#39;04, Conor</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to determine if the valuation of property adheres to the 33 1/3 proportion of market value required by the state of Illinois or if assessors are overvaluing Bloomington real estate disproportionately across high and low income neighborhoods. Assessors have a motivation to over-value high-income properties disproportionately resulting in intentional and systematic bias which alters the property tax system. The results do not support this idea. They show a lower percent variation between assessed and market values in high-income households.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Economic Development and the Gender Wage Gap</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Haas &#39;06, Sherri</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Economic inequality between men and women is an important problem deserving of in-depth study because of the large number of people it affects. Not only do current gender wage gaps affect women, they also likely affect their children and future generations. A number of studies have found evidence that women tend to spend income differently then men, with greater shares being put back into the household and more equally allocated between children of both sexes (Blau, Ferber, and Winkler, 2001). This in tum improves equality between genders if both girls and boys receive similar benefits and education.
This study will examine the relationship between the gender wage gap and the degree of economic development of a country as measured by the gross domestic product per capita. A second model uses the United Nations Human Development Index as a more comprehensive measure of development. It also analyzes the relationship of educational attainment and general wage inequality to the size of the gender wage gap.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Resource Curse Revisited</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Manning &#39;04, Alexis</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research project examines the phenomenon of the resource curse-the inverse relationship between natural resource abundance and economic growth seen in developing countries since 1965. A large body of empirical research detects a negative statistical relationship between natural resource abundance and slow economic growth in developing countries during the latter part of the twentieth century. The resource curse argues that natural resources interact with various social, political, and economic factors, and the modification of these factors results in slower economic growth. This paper aims to investigate the validity of the resource curse. In contrast with many previous studies, the results of this paper do not find a statistically significant relationship between natural resources and economic growth, and therefore, the results do not support the existence of a resource curse. This study also explores some possible theoretical and empirical problems present in previous studies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Much Ado About Nothing&#39;s Criticism of the Renaissance Patriarchy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zomparelli &#39;07, Kristen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Conventional beliefs during the Renaissance still supported unchallenged patriarchal rule. Male domestic treatise writers as well as male educators during the Renaissance prescribed silence as a necessary virtue for the ideal woman (Hull, Women 23). The most common rationale for women&#39;s silence was religious, and men used Biblical examples - such as the story of creation, the story of the Fall, and the Proverbial descriptions of the good wife - to support their beliefs in women&#39;s silence (Kelso 3). Men also prescribed obedience, chastity, and domesticity for women as a strategic method of preserving men&#39;s limitless, unchallenged power (Hull, Women 23). Men kept women marginalized and silent to prevent any disturbances or threats to the patriarchy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Vietnamese Land Reform: the Domestic Impetus to Communist Compromises at Geneva</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Callahan &#39;04, Robert</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Fighting for fifty-five consecutive days and nights, Vietnamese resistance forces- the Vietminh - scored a devastating victory over the French at Dienbienphu on May 7, 1954. The chains of 100 years of French colonialism were close to being broken; long awaited independence and unification appeared to be at hand. One day after the historic victory, the Vietnamese entered negotiations for an end to the war at Geneva, seemingly in a position of strength after almost nine years of successful warfare against the French.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>&#39;Make Yourself for a Person&#39;, Anzia Yezierska&#39;s Alternative Americanization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kiel &#39;03, Amy M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As more than two and a half million Jewish immigrants flooded America between 1880 and 1920, women struggled to define their role in the Jewish community. While men in the Old World expected women to be submissive to their authority, the New World provided a spirit of independence for youthful women. Women like writer Anzia Yezierska sought out this independence and escaped the oppression of Old World traditions by creating fiction which mimicked her struggles as an immigrant. In her semi-autobiographical novel Breadgivers, Yezierska depicts Sara Smolinsky as the youngest daughter of Reb, a Torah scholar, who forces his daughters to financially and emotionally support his devotion to prayer. Rather than sacrifice her life for her father, Sara embraces the New World spirit and leaves seeking an education. She triumphantly declared &#34;I&#39;m smart enough to look out for myself. It&#39;s a new life now...Thank God, I&#39;m not living in olden times.&#34; As Sara flew for the door in search of her new life in college, she thought, &#34;The Old World had struck its last on me.&#34; Only after college did Sara realize that the oppression of not only her father, but the burdens of the generations before him still lay upon her. Young female protagonists like Sara believed they were pioneers who in becoming American shed the ethnicity that robbed them of the wealth, education and respect of Anglo middle-class &#34;whites.&#34;</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Regulating Babylon: Religion and Rebellion in Pre-Revolutionary North Carolina</dc:title>
<dc:creator>King &#39;03, Sarah E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Past historians have situated the Regulator conflict in largely economic or social terms. James Whittenburg and others claim that at the time of the Regulation, a new and vast social division was present in backcountry society. The established backcountry settlers-the agrarian, yeoman farmers of Hermon Husbands&#39; ilk-resented their recent displacement by mercantile and political interests. The Regulation, then, simply &#34;crystallized widespread anxiety over the swift economic and political changes taking place in the piedmont.&#34; The Regulators used fleeting issues of the moment to rectify their lessening influence in North Carolina. Rachel Klein similarly argues in Unification of a Slave State that the Regulators were trying to conserve their political clout and economic opportunities, and consequently were &#34;something less than radical social critics.&#34; The Regulator Rebellion, Whittenburg and Klein claim, was undertaken to ensure backcountry agrarian interests.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Translation of Radical Ideas into Radical Action: The American Revolution and Revolutionary Philadelphia</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Skeggs &#39;04, Angela</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The battle for the independence of the American colonies has been attributed to many competing motives and factors. Within the vast array of literature on the subject, there are different schools of interpretation. Progressive-era historians tend to focus upon economic motivations underlying the American Revolution.] Within this school of thought historians actually explored possible class conflict and the social ramifications of the revolution. An opposing school of thought arose out of reaction against the progressive historians. The Neo-Whig school of thought placed a higher value on constitutional principles and ideas during the American Revolution, and discounted other motives driving the revolution (like economical) Bernard Bailyn&#39;s Ideological Origins of the American Revolution is a prime example of how Neo-Whigs interpreted history. For them, ideas were of utmost importance. The crux of the conflict was over which was more important: economic motivation or political ideas in guiding the revolution. Inherent in this conflict is also the question of action and ideas. The progressive school of historians tend to pay more attention to actual actions, and the Neo-Whigs are far more concerned with ideas. These two schools of thought helped to shape much of the argument surrounding the American revolution, and can determine how we interpret radicalness during the American Revolution.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reforming the Stage and Screen: How Expectations, Audiences, and Economics Shaped the Film and Theatre Censorship Movements in Early-1930s New York</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Simpson &#39;05, Jenna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nineteen thirty-four: it was a year that changed Hollywood history. After decades of studio production codes, agitation for censorship, and broken promises, in the spring and summer of 1934 prominent reform groups organized and banded together to threaten a boycott strong enough to cripple the massive Hollywood complex itself. Major studios, already in difficult financial straits because of Depression losses and debts left over from theater building and the recent conversion to sound, were cowed at the possibility of a massive consumer boycott. They agreed (not for the first time) to abide by a strict code of&#34;movie morals,&#34; and this time they (more or less) stuck to it, inaugurating what would later be known as the Golden Age of Hollywood.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>&#34;Spirit of Health&#34; and &#34;Goblin Damned&#34;: The Ghost of King Hamlet as a Symbol for the Religious Ambialence in England during the Religious Reformation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>O&#39;Connor &#39;06, Bridget</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A mysterious apparition appears during the opening scene of Hamlet, paradoxically seeking revenge and eternal peace. The Ghost of King Hamlet, unlike the supernatural spirits in most of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, is one of the most significant characters in Hamlet because he is the catalyst that sets the play in motion. Without him, Hamlet would never have known the truth about his father&#39;s death and would never have embarked upon the mission to kill Claudius. Because the Ghost&#39;s role is so pivotal to the plot, it was essential that the Elizabethan audience believed that the Ghost was real in order for the play to be successful. However, due to the cultural and religious beliefs at the time, this was no easy feat for Shakespeare to accomplish. England was in the midst of the Religious Reformation, swinging back and forth between Catholicism and Protestantism - two religions with two very different beliefs about ghosts. Remnants of both religions are present in Hamlet, and as a result, a lengthy debate over the Ghost&#39;s true religious affiliation has ensued over the centuries since the play was written. However, I believe that the Ghost of King Hamlet cannot be defined as wholly Catholic or Protestant, but rather serves as a symbol for the religious ambivalence present in England during the time it was written.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Campaigning in America: Captain Johann Ewald&#39;s Hessians in the American Revolution</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bereiter &#39;01, Gregory D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>At a time when it would seem that all historical evidence concerning the American Revolution has been unearthed, history has surprised us yet again. In the aftermath of World War II, a journal, unknown except to a few, which had been kept by Captain Johann Ewald, a company commander in the Hessian Field Jager Corps, was procured by an American historian assigned to intelligence and historical duties in the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany. After 30 years of piecing together the journal&#39;s scattered volumes, translating and editing, the journal was at last published in 1979, and now stands as &#34;the most important and comprehensive diary kept by a Hessian mercenary&#34; during the American Revolution. Indeed, the Ewald diary opens anew to students of the Revolution a dimension of the conflict that has been somewhat discounted by American military historians: Hessian participation as auxiliary troops hired by Great Britain.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Take Me Out to the Ballgame: How the East-west Classic All-Star Game Affected the African American Community of the Midwest</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bucholz &#39;04, Trisha L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Thirty years ago only baseball aficionados and some African Americans were very familiar with the existence of the all-black Negro League baseball teams. Since then, the general public has been made more and more aware of these teams and their histories. Surely, though, these teams had more importance for the black community than to simply represent a &#34;blip&#34; on the cultural radar of African Americans. In the halcyon days of the &#34;Roaring Twenties,&#34; the darkest days of the Great Depression, and the most fearsome days of World War II, these teams existed. For better or worse they seemed determined to continually find a field to play on and a crowd to play for, and they rarely faced disappointment. In the Midwest, where the population of some towns only numbered a few thousand, and the black population significantly less, the crowds arrived to watch one of these &#34;barnstorming&#34; teams. Society pages in newspapers buzzed about special games, and women&#39;s clubs feted players&#39; wives. Although their heyday was in the first part of the twentieth century, the Negro Leagues are still remembered fondly among members of today&#39;s black community. These facts force a deeper look at what entertainment, in this case baseball, does for a community.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>To Cover Ancient Prejudice with the Palladium of Scientific Argument: Women, Reproduction, Pseudo-Science, and the Alarm of Race Suicide, 1870-1915</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hamilton &#39;04, Sarah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In 1905 President Theodore Roosevelt presented the decreasing size of native born American families to Congress as &#34;one of the greatest sociological phenomena of our time&#34; and of&#34;far greater importance than any mere political or economic question,&#34; although by that time the size of the American family had been shrinking steadily for about a century. He condemned the tendency towards smaller families as decadent, a sign of moral disease and, like others who worried about &#34;race suicide,&#34; he specifically condemned women by categorizing those who avoided large families as criminals against the race and the objects of detestation by healthy, more &#34;noble&#34; people. Although President Roosevelt did not coin the term &#34;race suicide,&#34; it quickly became the label for these types of ideas concerning the size of American families and the part women allegedly played in causing them to decline in contrast to traditional sex roles. Race suicide was a deliberately provocative term and, as historian Linda Gordon demonstrates, it summarized many different reactions to demographic changes in industrial America and rejections of traditional sex roles into a united expression that was able to raise alarm and mobilize public opinion.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Hawley &#39;06, Lindsay M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Given the substantial amount literature on the Sixties, it is only natural that much scholarship would exist on the Students for a Democratic Society, one of its largest protest organizations. Divisions abound in literature on SDS. Some view the group as the most vital force of&#34;the Movement,&#34; the general term for the widespread political and social counterculture that emerged in the Sixties. Others, like Andrew Hunt, contest this strong focus on SDS as the dominant protest organization of the era. Historians like Todd Gitlin make broad claims to the immense practical impact of SDS on society-&#34;as an amalgam of reform efforts, especially for civil rights...and women&#39;s rights and the environment and against the war, it had been a formidable success.&#34; To Gitlin, SDS and the New Left only appear to have had a limited impact due to the dramatic resurgence of the right in the seventies and eighties that reversed the Movement&#39;s true to life gains. Others claim that SDS made little practical impact-that its gains were only intangibles.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Trembling for the Nation: Illinois Women and the Election of 1860</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rozinek &#39;01, Erika</dc:creator>
<dc:description>On November 1, 1860, America was five days away from the election that would decide the next President, and ultimately, the fate of the nation. In Illinois, emotions ran high, and citizens had regularly turned out at political gatherings in full force to endorse their presidential favorite. Both Democrats and Republicans were confidant that the election of their candidate would save the Union, and the election of the opponent would plunge the country into civil war. In Springfield, Illinois Republicans hosted a mass meeting to rally the supporters of Lincoln in the upcoming presidential election and to intimidate the &#34;terror stricken enemy.&#34; This meeting was attended by thousands of citizens from the city and surrounding area, drawing visitors who traveled over miles of dusty prairie roads to attend the festivities. The lucky ones took rooms at hotels or boardinghouses. The rest of the masses camped out or found hospitality among the Republican citizens of the city. The evening&#39;s events included &#34;a magnificent feast&#34; prepared by &#34;the hospitable ladies of our city,&#34; music from a brass band and the local Glee Club, and a speech in the Hall of Representatives. &#34;A vast crowd of ladies and gentlemen&#34; attended these festivities, and the Illinois State Journal reported, behaved &#34;with far more enthusiasm than could reasonably be expected.&#34; Overall, this gathering drew thousands of politically minded citizens male and female - who hoped to prevent Douglas&#39;s &#34;mad and suicidal&#34; political agenda.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Female and Male Pseudonyms: Sex, Gender, Culture, and Name Suppression from Boston to Philadelphia and Beyond</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Calaway &#39;03, Jared C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Ever since Benjamin Franklin wrote his autobiography, biographers throughout the centuries have molded him into the model American. Recently, too, historians increasingly have chosen Benjamin Franklin as a biographical subject. In 2000, H. W. Brands wrote a seven-hundred-plus page biography of Franklin entitled The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin, and, in 2002, Edmund S. Morgan published his more concise book, Benjamin Franklin. The current rising interest in Benjamin Franklin is not surprising in light of the surging surplus of biographical sketches of  many of the&#34;Founding Fathers&#34;such as Joseph Ellis&#39;s work on Thomas Jefferson and David McCullough&#39;s biography of John Adams. In any case, as one can see by the title of Brands&#39;s book, these modem Franklin biographers, like their predecessors, use Franklin to create an ideal citizen. Therefore, they tend to emphasize Franklin&#39;s political and diplomatic roles, seeing his contributions to the public sphere and to the American Revolution as the most important aspects of his life.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Confederation at the Tip of a Sword: How the Threat of American Aggression Created the Dominion of Canada</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Roloff &#39;03, Katrina L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Throughout the nineteenth century American expansion was aggressive and unbridled, causing fear throughout the Western Hemisphere. This was especially true for British North America, which had a history of dealing with American antagonism and repelling American invasion. By the time the American Civil War began in 1861, British North America had dealt with eighty-six years of American ill will. In the four years of the American Civil War, tensions between British North America and the United States increased to the point where the British colonists sought the reorganization of the provinces as a means of greater defense against aggression. In terms of how significantly the American threat affected British North American Confederation, as the historian Alfred Leroy Burt noted &#34;it is more than doubtful...there could have been a Dominion of Canada then or for along time afterward, if at all, without the Civil War.&#34;</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Fading Gleam of a Golden Age: Britain&#39;s Battle Against Piracy in the Americas in the Early 18th Century</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Adamson &#39;04, Roger</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Trial records pertaining to the pirate captain Thomas Green contain the following statements: &#34;A pirate is in a perpetual war with every individual, and every state, christian or infidel. Pirates properly have no country, but by the nature of their guilt, separate themselves, and renounce on this matter, the benefit of all lawful societies.&#34; Pirates had no king, served no master, and did not sail under a universal flag. As a result of these tendencies, maintaining order and solidarity in times of danger proved difficult. During their prime, pirates assumed a predatory status by intimidating merchant vessels. They were ruthless and experienced fighters and generally outnumbered their opponents in strength of men and guns. However, once the British Navy was deployed the tables quickly turned. As the hunter became the hunted, the pirates proved no match for the military might of an empire, and in the end this loose conglomeration of ignoble and murderous men doomed themselves to perish.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Through Their Eyes: Buffalo Bill&#39;s Wild West as a Drawing Table for American Identity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>White &#39;05, Katherine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>For the last quarter of the 19th century, in places such as New York, Chicago, California, London, Georgia, even in smaller towns like Bloomington, Illinois, Wild West shows were the &#34;it&#34; thing. Presented to crowds of 20,000 and more, they were spine-tingling, rip-roaring sensations not to be missed, if nothing else, for the sake of a story to tell a grandchild fifty years later. As the harsh, open expanses of the American West closed in with the heavy footsteps of manifest destiny, the &#34;character building&#34; quality of Western land and Western life found a new home in Wild West shows and the public discourse surrounding them. The ability to construct distinctly American identities that contemporary historian Fredrick Jackson Turner attributed to the Westward moving pioneer was now available, in entertainment form, to all.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Organochlorine Pesticide Contamination in Neotropical Avifauna from Northwest Costa Rica</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Flanagin &#39;99, Virginia L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>We collected baseline data on organochlorine (OC) pesticide contamination in resident passerine birds from northwest Costa Rica in an area where pesticides had not been used in at least 30 years. Results were compared with a previous study of OC contamination in mayfly larvae (Euthyplocia hecuba) collected from the same region. Thirteen OC compounds were detected in the ng/g range for 19 of 56 birds sampled, and the highest OC frequencies were found in birds collected from Pitilla, the site closest to agricultural areas. Atmospheric transport could be a mechanism by which the pesticides are traveling from agricultural areas to areas where pesticides have never been used. OC levels were lower in birds than in mayfly larvae, which suggests that either the birds were not in the same food chain as the mayflies, or that the birds may have been younger that the larvae collected. Moreover, the OC contamination of the birds was dominated by p,p&#39;-DDE, in contrast endosulfan dominated the mayfly OC contamination.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Radioimmunoassay Analysis of Testosterone Levels in Clutches of House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) Egg Yolks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fryzel &#39;96, Kimberly A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Recent evidence indicates that variation in intensity of aggressiveness and competitive ability among nestlings of a clutch may be attributed, at least partly, to differences in maternally deposited yolk testosterone that affects embryonic development (Schwabl 1993). We developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for measuring yolk testosterone levels in house wren (Troglodytes aedon) eggs. This procedure was used in initial studies to determine whether yolk testosterone varies within a clutch of house wren eggs. The analysis revealed the presence of higher levels of testosterone in yolks of eggs laid later in the clutch sequence. Because later laid eggs tend to hatch later (Winkler 1993), variation in the amount of testosterone deposited by the female may ensure a greater chance of survival for younger, less developed offspring.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using Random Sequence Primers in the Polymerase Chain Reaction to identify Gender-Specific Genetic Markers in House Wrens</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kirchman &#39;94, Jeremy J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In order to fully understand the biology of asexually reproducing organism, it is essential that one is able to distinguish the males from the females. In determining the gender of monomorphic birds, standard techniques including visual identification, surgery, and karyotyping are impossible or impractical for large-scale studies. A reliable gender identification method that uses genetic markers identified within the DNA would be an asset to the researcher because it would require only a minimal blood sample which could be collected in the field without harming the bird and stored easily for long periods of time. Griffiths and Tiwari (1993) described such a technique based on the generation of RAPD markers (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA). The use of RAPDs involves the amplification of genomic DNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers of arbitrary oligonucleotide sequence to generate-a range of DNA fragments that can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. This study employs this method to generate a reliable sex probe for the house wren (Troglodytes aedon), using RAPDs to isolate female-specific markers from random locations on the W sex chromosome. Results indicate that after extensive manipulation of the Griffiths and Tiwari protocol, consistent PCR amplification of house wren DNA was achieved. However, further research is necessary to find a primer that will yield W specific fragments in large samples of wrens. If successful, the sex probe will be used in future studies of house wren reproductive strategy. Specifically, gender identification information of house wren nestlings will be used to investigate the maternal condition hypothesis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Temperature on Reproductive Characteristics of an Asexually Reproducing Rotifer (Class Bdelloidea)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Galbreath &#39;97, Kurt E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Most organisms exhibit sexual reproduction. Rotifers of the class Bdelloidea, however, seem to be a notable exception to this pattern. No male bdelloid individuals have ever been observed, and females apparently reproduce entirely through parthenogenesis. Sexual reproduction occurs in rotifers of the class Monogononta, and in many cases it is induced by environmental cues (e.g. temperature, diet). In this study, Philodina sp. was examined to determine if variations in temperature could induce a sexual cycle in bdelloid rotifers. Sibling individuals (clones) were raised with equal amounts of food at 20°C and 30°C. Newly hatched offspring produced by these individuals were counted and removed at approximately 12 hour intervals until the parent died. Individuals exhibiting unusual characteristics were isolated as possible males and raised for closer examination. No males were positively identified. However, temperature greatly affected reproduction rates. At 30°C individuals had a significantly greater rate of reproductive (Q10 = 2.34) and produced more offspring than those at 20°C. Furthermore, age at the start of reproduction was significantly earlier at 30°C than at 20°C. Unexpectedly, presumed genetically identical clones of Philodina sp. showed significant variation in lifespan when raised in equivalent environmental conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Photosynthetic bacteria contain bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) which has two major portions, a magnesium tetrapyrrole and an esterifying alcohol. BChl plays a key role in photosynthesis which is necessary for converting radiant energy into energy that can be used in cellular processes. The esterifying alcohol portion affects the function of the BChl in photosynthesis, but its role is not well understood. Rhodobacter capsulatus typically produces BChl a esyrtified with phytol (BChl ap), but site directed mutational analysis has shown that a mutation is bchP results in the accumulation of a BChl a esterified with geranylgeraniol (BChl agg) indicating that the product of the bchP locus (the BchP polypeptide) is necessary for the reductive maturation of BChl agg to BChl ap. In order to determine if BchP is sufficient for this process, the gene has been amplified using polymerase chain reaction and restriction endonuclease sites have been created flanking the gene so that it can be cloned into a plasmid known as pT7-7. This construct was then transformed into a strain of E. coli (C600) which contains the pGPl-2 plasmid with the gene for T7 RNA polymerase which is under the control of the APL promoter. When the strain containing both plasmids is incubated at 42°C. T7 RNA polymerase is produced which can transcribe bchP producing BchP. Future work will include in vitro assays to determine if BchP is sufficient for the maturation of BChl agg to BChl ap.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Lipid Biochemistry of House Wren Egg Yolk and Possible Effects on Incubation Period</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Payne &#39;01, Brian J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) are distributed throughout North and South America. As has been observed in many avian species, populations of House Wrens in the tropics have longer egg incubation periods than populations in temperate regions. The purpose of this study was to characterize incubation periods of a temperate population of House Wrens and to conduct a preliminary chemical analysis of the yellow and white yolk layers of House Wren eggs. The eggs were collected from a breeding population in Central Illinois from June-August 2000. Avian yolk is composed of yellow and white components, which are laid down in alternating layers around a core of white yolk called the latebra. White yolk is produced at night, while yellow yolk is produced during the day. Along with the temporal differences in formation, yellow and white yolk differ in their biochemical make-up in that yellow yolk is richer in high-energy lipids. The proportions of yellow and white yolk may differ in eggs from tropical and temperate populations of House Wrens, which may influence the rate of embryonic development and thus incubation periods.
There was a 90.0% hatching success from the artificial incubation of temperate House Wren eggs (n=30), which had a mean incubation period of 13.6 days ± 0.2SD, which is significantly different than the literature value, 12.2 days ± 0.2SD, of a natural population of House Wrens in a temperate region. The lipid components (triacylglycerol, phospholipid, free cholesterol, cholesterol ester and free fatty acid) of commercially sold unincubated chicken eggs were analyzed. Extraction of the lipids from the yolks was conducted using a modification of the Folch method, followed by the separation of lipid components using preparatory TLC. This method produced a 93.4-96.0% lipid recovery rate with little variability (&#60;6.0%) in replicate portions of the same yolk. Future work will involve incubating eggs from tropical House Wrens and conducting a chemical analysis of their yolks. Yolk lipid analysis of temperate House Wren eggs will also be done.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Assay for the Estimation of Organic Content in Unknown Biological Samples</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schneider &#39;00, William J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Potassium dichromate, in an acidic solution, will oxidize organic material. The reduction to the chromium ion is associated with a color change, which can be measured as a change in absorbance using a spectrophotometer. The degree of change is linearly related to the total energy contained in a sample and this information can be used to predict the energy content of unknown samples. However, the slopes of these relationships are significantly different for carbohydrates and proteins. It is hypothesized that these variations are due to differences in the reaction kinetics and that these differences can be used to predict the biochemical composition of mixtures of proteins and carbohydrates. Data collected to date indicate changes to the procedure are necessary for accurate estimation of biochemical content.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Characterization of the TY5 Strain of Chamydomonas reinhardtii, a Chlorophyll Biosynthetic Mutant</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Graham &#39;98, Robert</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Chlorophyll is the light harvesting molecule for many photosynthetic organisms. As a result, chlorophyll is an extremely important molecule, directly or indirectly, to nearly all life. The production of chlorophyll involves a long and complex pathway. The conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide is one of the final steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. Some of the factors affecting the regulation of this process were the focus of this project.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>See Jill Paint: An Experiment in Queer Film</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Aubry &#39;02, Sarah M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My film, See Jill Paint, is an exploration of the possibilities for non-oppressive, nonviolent objectification. I started with a strong desire to focus a short movie around the application of colorful paint to nipples and the surrounding areas; as I progressed towards that goal, I questioned how the project might correspond or conflict with the radical gender politics that I value. In sexist objectification, people (mostly women) are perceived as being only visual objects at the expense of their subjectivity. I think it is possible to draw attention to bodies as objects and simultaneously affirm the complexity of the embodied subject. The intent of my film project was to explore some possibilities for positive objectification. I achieved this by disrupting the conventions of sexist objectification and replacing them with a playful context.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Systematic Relationship of Hipposideros Commersoni Matungensis to Other Species of Rhinolophidae (Chiroptera)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Koneval &#39;93, Maureen E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The hyoid morphology of Hipposideros commersoni matungensis was dissected and compared to the morphology of other bats in the family Rhinolophidae. Several significant differences in morphology were found: a modified stylohyal, fused to the auditory bulla; loss of the stylohyoid; addition of a new muscle, possibly from the stylopharyngeus; a modified mylohyoid profundus; and insertion of the ceratohyoid onto only the stylohyal. Cladistic analysis suggests that of all bats examined, H. commersoni is most closely related to H. armiger, and Triaenops persicus is most closely related to Rhinonycteris aurantius. This result is unexpected because the ranges of the species are geographically distant: H. commersoni is an African bat, whereas H. armiger is from East Asia. Triaenops is also an African species, whereas Rhinonycteris is Australian.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Antihero: Jung and the Art of Storytelling</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bratton &#39;04, Amanda G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It was Sigmund Freud who first promoted the idea of universal symbols by observing the recurring symbols found in dreams. It was his belief that the interpretation of these symbols was a link to the subconscious and that they were the result of the expression or repression of sexual energy that was common to all individuals. Based upon this theory Karl lung formulated his own theories about universal symbols stating the belief that they derived from a &#39;collective unconscious&#39; that was inherent in the psyche of all individuals. Through the observation of dream symbolism and storytelling practices it became evident that there were ideas that remained constant regardless of history and culture. Jung especially noted the reappearance of different character types, which he called &#34;archetypes.&#34; Having made these observations, Jung was able to focus on how collective ideas were communicated through culture and society.</dc:description>

<dc:description>From the beginning of my investigation of Quartet, the text has intimidated me; after all, the script is infused with a multitude of literary, historical, and philosophical references and quotes all of which Heiner Mueller, himself, prefers to dissociate himself from. &#34;The theatre has nothing to do with ideas,&#34; Mueller once stated. Paradoxically his theatre is one that is full of ideas and whether Mueller chose, in his own lifetime, to recognize the ideas of his theatre or not, it is precisely his provocative ideas and images that has been the basis for this paper. In his dramatic text, Quartet, Heiner Mueller negotiates an array of theatrical theories and aesthetics, philosophies, segments of history, literary personas, in addition to a powerful selection of images, thus generating a stimulating multi-faceted dramatic collage.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Organochlorine Pesticide Contamination in New World Passerines</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sager &#39;97, Tyler A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Organochlorine pesticide contaminants detrimentally affect wildlife in many ways, including lowered reproductive success, endocrine disruption, and embryonic defects. Most organochlorine pesticides have been banned in the United States after the recognition of these effects. However, these pesticides are still used in Central and South America, and little information is available concerning the levels of pesticide contamination in wildlife from these areas. Furthermore, little data exist regarding organochlorine pesticide contamination in passerines (songbirds). The purpose of this study was to determine the presence in passerines of organochlorine pesticides that are of concern to the Environmental Protection Agency. Neotropical resident species (i.e. those living year-round Central and South America) were collected from Argentina and Peru in 1996, Neotropical migrant species (i.e. those that winter in Central and South America and breed in North America) were collected in central and western Illinois from 1991-1996, and Nearctic resident species (i.e. those living year-round in North America) were collected in central Illinois in 1995 and 1996. Contamination levels were compared between each of the above geographic locations. Predominate pesticides found in Nearctic resident and Neotropical migrant species included DDE, dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide. No significant levels of organochlorine pesticides were found in the Neotropical resident birds. Significantly higher pesticide levels were found in Neotropical migrants than in Neotropical residents. No difference was found in pesticide levels among the Neotropical migrants in relation to age class. These findings suggest that passerines may be acquiring organochlorine pesticides in North America.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Titus and the Queen: Julia Berenice and the Opposition to Titus&#39; Succession</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Vasta &#39;07, Michael S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that one of the primary reasons for this apprehension towards Titus&#39; succession was his &#34;conspicuous love ofthe queen Berenice, to whom, they say, he even promised marriage. The affair of Titus and Berenice has not been given proper attention by modem scholars. Most ignore the affair or gloss over it as a novelty, yet this is an error. Those who do connect the relationship of Titus and Berenice to the political context of Flavian Rome, such as John Crook, mistakenly associate the delay in Berenice&#39;s arrival to the influence of Licinius Mucianus. However, this paper will demonstrate that the relationship of Titus and Berenice is integral to understanding the opposition to the Flavian regime, and Titus&#39; succession in particular. It will examine how the history ofJulia Berenice before and after the start of her affair with Titus served as ammunition for the opposition against her and argue that their relationship became a focal point for the opposition to Titus&#39; succession led by Helvidius Priscus.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The focus ofthis paper is beyond a critique of U.S. immigration law and the 4 regions&#39; judicial systems, although their roles as they relate to gang activities in these areas will be assessed. Nor is this paper a comprehensive ethnographic account of gang life and gang structure in general.

<dc:description>This paper presents the results of a research into the reasons why students do and do not study abroad during their years at Illinois Wesleyan University (IWU). After establishing the importance of the research question, the paper continues with a description ofa survey ofIWU students conducted in Spring 2003. Presentation and analysis of the results follow. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential policy changes that could lead to an increase in the number of IWU students who study abroad in the future.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Atypical Estar: Innovative Vs. Conservative Uses of Estar in Guadalajara, Mexico</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hoffenberg &#39;02, Alissa</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Spanish copula of seriestar has not only been a heavily investigated topic In Hispanic linguistics throughout the past century (Crespo, 1946; De Mello, 1979; Franco &#38; Steinmetz, 1983), but it has actually been receiving much attention for more than eight hundred years (Vaii6-Cerda, 1982). The serlestar verb copula is equivalent to only one verb in many other languages, such as English, in which both ser and estar are translated as &#39;to be.&#39; Whereas in English we explain and describe existence, location, and state with the use of the one simple verb, &#39;to be,&#39; Spanish speakers face a decision between two verbs. If the differences in choosing between ser and estar were always clearly defined and simple, this copula would not be as confusing and problematic as it has been historically. The complication is rooted in the lack of uncovering and recognizing the full semantic values and differences between the two verbs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Las sendas del desencanto: Los mares del sur de Manuel Vazquez Montalban</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Slough &#39;07, Rachel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Manuel Vazquez Montalban (Barcelona 1939-Bangkok 2003), uno de los escritores espanoles contemporaneos mas prolificos, es conocido no solamente por sus obras literarias sino tambien por su ideologia politica de izquierda y por su entonces aguda critica a la incipiente sociedad democratica espanola de los setenta y ochenta. Escribio quince novelas detectivescas entre 1972 y 2000 que tienen como protagonista a Pepe Carvalho, un detective privado al que Ie gusta la comida gourmet y sieve como un alter ego de Montalban-escritor-intelectual de izquierda y anti-franquista declarado. La cuarta novela de esta serie, Los mares del Sur (1979) que gano el Premio Planeta en 1979, trata fundamentalmente de las maneras de escapar de las dificultades de la transicion espanola.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analysis ofthe Future Tense in Two Argentinean Cities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Miller &#39;02, Denise E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Spanish language has many dialects throughout the world, which vary on phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical levels, among others. The Argentinean national dialect of Spanish readily distinguishes itself from others primarily through: (a) the use of vos instead of tit as the 2nd person singular subject pronoun, (b) the use of the [~] and [i] phonemes instead of the peninsular standard [y], and (c) the use of lunfardo, a national form of slang originated in Buenos Aires. Not only does vos replace tit as a subject, but it also has its own series of verb conjugations, specifically in the present indicative, which are not used with any other subject.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Risk Management through Derivatives Securitization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Filip &#39;07, Stefan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the fluctuations in the financial markets reaching tens ofbillions of dollars in just one day, using complex financial instruments instead oftypical insurance could be more effective and cheaper to finance high-severity and low frequency risk exposures. Insurance-linked derivatives such as catastrophes bonds and weather bonds have been used for some time in the United States and European Union. The risks that they cover vary from property catastrophes, weather, general liability, and extreme mortality risks. As the number ofissuers for these securities increases and new over-thecounter (OTC) products appear on the secondary markets there is a growing need to understand how they should be priced and considered by law. I intend to analyze the methods ofpricing as well as creating a model for a weather derivative for the Illinois com production and test its impact based on past statistical data</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Solution to the Shortage of Capital in the Property Insurance Industry</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gebauer &#39;96, Amy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Due to the recent increase in the severity and frequency of natural catastrophes, insurers believe that insured losses from such catastrophes can exceed $50 billion. There is not enough capital available in the insurance industry to cover such catastrophic losses. Therefore, insurers have begun looking for new sources of capital. The most promising solution is in the capital market, specifically in catastrophe insurance options. The options have a settlement index, which is the market&#39;s estimate of the losses for the covered quarter. While these options have advantages as well as disadvantages over reinsurance. The main problem hindering the market is the lack of a generally accepted pricing model. Neither option pricing models nor reinsurance pricing methods are suitable for the severity of recent catastrophes. Since a pricing model would probably dramatically increase the popularity of catastrophe insurance options, the search for such a model is the source of great discussion in the insurance industry.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Organochlorine Pesticide Contamination and its Potential Effects on Eggshell Characteristics of Dickcissels (Spiza americana)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wall &#39;08, Bridget</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dickcissels (Spiza americana) are small, sparrow-like songbirds that nest in grasslands in the U.S. and winter in Venezuela. Fanners in Venezuela intentionally spray dickcissel flocks with organochlorine (DC) and other illegal pesticides in an attempt to kill them when they feed in both rice and sorghum fields. Previous studies have shown that organochlorine (DC) pesticide&#39; contaminants (e.g., DDT) have significantly reduced eggshell thickness in eagles and falcons.. Although DDT was banned in the United States more than twenty years ago, DC compounds and their metabolites still persist in wildlife, possibly resulting in reduced reproductive success and in disrupted endocrine systems (Harper et al. 1996). Recent studies (e.g., Harper et al. 1996; Klemens et al. 2000; Bartuszegvige et al. 2002) have shown DC contamination in Neotropica1 migratory passerines (i.e., songbirds that breed in Canada and the United States and winter in Mexico and Central and South America.), including dickcissels. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationships between DC contamination on thickness and color (hue, saturation and brightness) of dickcissel eggshells. The ecological implications of contamination may include the effect of eggshell coloration on the amount of male parental investment, reduced hatching success of dickcissel eggs, as well as the success of dickcissels in rejecting brownheaded cowbird (Molothrus ater) eggs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Small Banking Conditions and their Impact on the Economic Activity of US Firms</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bannos &#39;08, Stephanie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study is directed towards the effects of bank lending, delinquencies, and other economic shocks on the performance of economic activity. I estimate the effect of these factors on employment, payrolls, and number of firms by firm size in the United States. Addressing conditions within the realm of small banks, one conclusion is that banks increase their total supply of bank credit after a reduction in capital levels. A number of former studies arrive at this conclusion, and this paper applies that hypothesis to more recent data. A common theme in related literature is that a &#34;credit crunch&#34; causes particular stress on small businesses because of their heavy reliance on external financing, which is mainly provided by small &#34;community&#34; banks. Small banks have historically been thought to have special ties to small businesses, but with the consolidation of banks over recent years, this study suggests that relationship between small banks and small businesses has declined. Using data for banks with assets under $300 million from 2001-2005, this study reveals ways in which real activity is affected by variations in bank credit conditions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Responding to Romanticism</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Higgins &#39;08, Valerie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My vision was aided by the fact that this course on the Romantics encouraged me to engage with the material in ways that were both critical and creative. In addition to critical essays and papers, one assignment required that students keep a notebook of personal responses to course readings. The seeds for the essays in this project were planted and germinated in that assignment. Thus, it was my creative and critical reactions to the work of the Romantics, combined with the creative and critical works of the Romantics themselves, which provided me with examples of a different kind of engagement with texts, illustrating the possibility of a response that was both visceral and reflective, emotional and intellectual, imaginative and theoretical.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>My Little Force Explodes: A Re-creation of the Assembly of Emily Dickinson&#39;s Fasicicle 18</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brokaw &#39;02, Katie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is hard to recall my exact first encounter with Emily Dickinson. In some ways, I feel as though I have always known her. I remember quoting A word is dead! When it is said, / Some say. / I say is just / Begins to live / That day to my Junior High language arts class. Throughout the years, Dickinson has grown with me, in me. In the summer of 2000, I began an independent study focusing on ED&#39;s fascicles. It was during that summer that I chose to focus on F.18, by virtue of the fact that it contains &#34;After Great Pain,&#34; a poem which is the quintessence of my fascination with ED. I came to see this fascicle as a microcosm, a distilled version of ED&#39;s personal crises and her crucial relationship with the world.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Characterizing Conformational Changes Along the Dimerization Helix of the Global Regulator, FNR, Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zupancic &#39;03, Melanie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The FNR protein is a transcription factor that allows Escherichia coli to undergo anaerobic cellular respiration. It is known to positively regulate the expression ofseveral genes required for anaerobic respiration as well as negatively regulate genes responsible for aerobic respiration. Consequently, FNR is active under anaerobic conditions and inactive under aerobic conditions. Although the tertiary structure ofFNR is unknown, previous studies have indicated that FNR is inactive in the monomeric state and active in the dimeric state. Thus, it is believed that in anaerobic conditions, FNR undergoes a confonnational change from the monomeric to dimeric state. The mechanism involved in going from the monomeric to dimeric state is not completely understood, but it is thought to be triggered by the acquisition ofa [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in the N-tenninal region ofFNR. The acquisition ofthe cluster causes a confonnational change to be transmitted through the allosteric domain to the dimerization helix resulting in the active dimeric species. Infonnation regarding the environment of amino acid residues in the dimerization helix in both the active and inactive fonns of FNR could be helpful in eliciting a better understanding ofthe dimerization mechanism. Such environmental conditions can be detennined by the fluorescent properties ofthe amino acid, tryptophan. Surface exposed tryptophan residues are expected to have a longer Amax than those buried in the hydrophobic core. In order to gain insight into the environment ofthe amino acids on the dimerization helix we have created tryptophan mutants (LWI46, MW147, MW157, KW163, and KW164) that either lay on or near the helix. The mutants KW163 and KW164 all lie on the periphery ofthe helix while LW146, MW147 and MW157 lie on the helix. Ofthe five mutants, KW163 retained anaerobic activity most similar to that of the wild type indicating that its structure is similar to the wild type protein with the exception ofthe single amino acid substitution. By comparing the fluorescence ofthe active and inactive forms of KW163, we hope to gain a better understanding ofthe dimerization mechanism ofFNR.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>&#34;How skinny I got, and how fucking weird I was&#34;: Michael Shannon, Sarah Kane, Woyzeck and Experiential Theatre</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lyons &#39;08, Marti</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The majority of academic focus on Sarah Kane has been on Kane the playwright; the purpose of this paper is to offer insight into Kane&#39;s artistry by examining Kane the director. In this paper I expand Aleks Sierz&#39;s concept of experiential theatre by using Sarah Kane&#39;s 1997 production of Woyzeck as a prototype. Essentially, experiential theatre is about blurring boundaries such as those between observer and participant, or between actor and character, or between the personal and the professional. In the rehearsal process and production of Woyzeck Kane blurred many boundaries; I will examine three in this paper: the actor/audience boundary, the actor/actor boundary and the actor/director boundary.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Stock Index Pricing with Random Walk and Agent-Based Models</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Swisher IV &#39;08, Scott N.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objective of this work is to empirically test the EMH (efficient market hypothesis) and compare its results to those of a viable agent-based competitor using computational simulation. The models are not directly fit to the data; random walk and agent-based methods of stock price determination are statistically compared using the criteria of stationarity, randomness, and autoregressive behavior. The agent-based approach used, styled the &#34;ant trader&#34; model, is based on the ant model established by Kirman in his 1993 work &#34;Ants, Rationality, and Recruitment&#34;. Daily returns of the Hang Seng and Nikkei 225 indices are used over the periods 1987-2007 and 1984-2007, respectively. Preliminary simulations run with the agent-based model indicate high sensitivity to parameter changes; parameter imbalances lead to unrealistic growth in returns. Batch stationarity tests using ADF and PP tests suggest that the two models behave similarly under the chosen parameter conditions. However, the random-walk model is found to be more consistent with the available data when using the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test and the LoMacKinlay variance ratio test. We conclude that the EMH can be theoretically challenged by the ant trader model, but not empirically. The agent-based model has more realistic assumptions and is more flexible; however, the random walk model agrees with the stationarity and randomness properties of realworld stock index return.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Determinants of Crack Cocaine Trial and Addiction</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Taylor &#39;08, Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper examines how socioeconomic factors contribute to initial use of crack cocaine and to eventual addiction. The paper focuses on two specific questions: what characteristics influence crack cocaine use initially and why do people continue to use crack cocaine? In order to answer these questions the paper utilizes basic supply and demand theory as well as general physiological theory on drug dependence. These theories, coupled with previous literature, suggest characteristics that would increase the probability of a person trying crack cocaine. However they also indicate that once a person has become addicted, these characteristics no longer matter. Ordinary Least Squares regressions as well as logistic models are utilized on crack cocaine related data from the 2006 National Household Survey on Drug Use and Health. In general, results are consistent with the theory. It also appears that historical associations between race and crack cocaine use seem to have changed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Misery and Militarization: High Military Expenditure and Minimal Development in India</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stone &#39;01, Michelle L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Considering its large and consistent allocations to defense over time, India has been noted to be a predominant military power in Asia. Concurrently, India can not claim to have reached notable levels of economic and social development. Minimal levels of development thwarts the ability of the population to attain basic needs such as food, health care, and education. Therefore, by examining economic and social variables over the 1974 to 1995 period within a recursive model, this paper determines that, in India, while economic development is not affected by military spending, social development is negatively affected by military spending. Moreover, the results determine that military spending specifically limits the attainment of food, education, and health care by the people of India.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Intracerebral Injections of Substance P, and a Substance P Fragment (5-11) into the Medial Preoptic Nucleus on Lordosis Behavior in the Female Rat</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jones &#39;90, Kellie S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study either substance P (SP), SP 5-11, an analogue resistant to enzymatic degradation, or acidified saline was injected bilaterally into the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) of the medial preoptic area (MPOA) in ovariectomized (ovx) estrogen-primed female rats. The lordosis quotient (LQ) and the lordosis intensity scale (LIS) were recorded using a steroid regime that produced a slow increase of sexual receptivity. In experiment 1, when receptivity was low, bilateral injections of 2 different doses of SP (100 ng,1000 ng/ cannula), had no effect on lordosis behavior when compared to those injected with acidified saline. In experiment , however, when receptivity was maximal, SP 5-11 (1000 ng/cannula) produced a marked decrease in lordosis responding. The results indicate t.hat the effects of bilateral injections of SP on lordosis behavior is dependent on the level of sexual receptivity, and therefore, estrogen levels.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effect of Copulation and Copulation Time on Female Reproductive Development in Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sherwood &#39;90, David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It has been established that a prolonged copulatory period of 3-4 hours is necessary for maximal insemination to occur in the western corn rootworn (WCR). This complete mating period has been suggested to speed ovarian development. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between copulation and ovarian development in the WCR. Using 11 and 12 day postemergence virgin WCR beetles, four female groups of varying copulatory duration were established: (1) 15 min. in copula (2) 1 hr. in copula (3) 2 hrs. in copula (4) a control group mated until natural completion. After copulation, these beetles along with a control group of unmated females were placed in isolated cage vials. Frequency of egg-laying and post-copulation change in female weight was recorded up until the time of dissection. The beetles were then sacrificed between 21-24 days post-copulation and the effects on ovarian development were evaluated with the following criteria: (1) reproductive status (an ovarian rating system) (2) morphometric analysis of ovarian area (using an Olympus C-R Research Image Analyzer with an IBM/PC Microcomputer). The presence of spermatozoa in the spermatheca was also noted at the time of dissection. The results demonstrate significantly larger mean ovarian area and greater mean reproductive status rating (P&#60;0.05) in the control group of mated until completion females compared with the control group of unmated females. Egg-laying frequency and mean post-copulation change in weight reflected fully developed ovaries present in the mated until completion beetles and not in the unmated beetles. The results with the groups of varying copulatory duration suggest that spermatozoa may play a role in the development of fully maturated ovaries. In addition, it appears that directly after copulation some factor other than spermatozoa is responsible for significant increases in reproductive development. This other factor appears relatively transient and does not maintain a significantly developed reproductive state past approximately 14 days post-copulation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Factors Influencing Employment in the U.S. Automobile Industry</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davies &#39;92, Paul S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During the 1980s, increased attention was paid by the united Auto Workers union and politicians to the U.S. automobile industry and the problems it was facing from Japanese competition. Now, with 1992 being a presidential election year, the candidates are continuing to draw attention to what they see as the problems of the U.S. auto industry. And this concern is not without reason. The share of the u.s. market held by the Big Three domestic producers (GM, Ford, and Chrysler), has decreased dramatically over the past three decades. As is shown in Figure 1, the market share of u.s. based producers has fallen from a high of 95.11% in 1962, to around 82% in the mid-1970S, to a low of around 64% in 1987 (MVMA World Motor Vehicle Data, 1990). These figures become even more alarming if we look at the market share of foreign transplants (i.e. foreign auto production plants in the U.S.) and imports taken together. They accounted for 41% of the market in 1990 (Singleton, 1992, p.22).</dc:description>

<dc:description>The flow of international investments has been rapidly increasing in recent years. One of the foremost reasons for international investing is that it provides diversification which can be explained in sinple terms as selecting securities that do not move together. The main benefit of diversification is that it reduces risk (Markowitz 1952). The amount of diversification provided by investing in international equity markets is dependent on the extent of co-movement of equity markets across the globe.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investments in Human Capital and the Poverty Transition</dc:title>

<dc:description>In 1990, almost 34 million people were living below the government&#39;s official poverty level (Hoffman, p.395). That represents 13.5 percent of the total population, or more people than live in the state of California. Thus, it should be obvious that the plight of the poor is one which warrants serious concern on all levels -political, social, and economic. Unfortunately, the question of how to alleviate this dreadful problem is one that has long perplexed even the most brilliant of minds.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Informational Asymmetry and the Demand for IPOs: An Explanation of Underpricing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Karlis &#39;00, Peter</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There exists large informational asymmetries in the stock market, particularly in the primary market where initial public offerings are made. This paper examines the large initial gains observed in a previous study and explains them using game theory.  The process of bringing an IPO to the market involves the issuing firm, the investment bank and the investors. This paper will discuss the strategic relationships that exist between these entities and why each either accepts a smaller gain or demands a risk premium based on the level of uncertainty they face. Accompanying the economic theories discussing these relationships is evidence from previous empirical studies siting underpricing in the process of bringing an initial public offering to the market.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Technological Progress and its Effects on the Interaction Between Money Supply and Demand: A Cointegration Approach</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Holly Jr. &#39;99, Patrick J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the significance of the effect current payment technologies ha e had on money supply and demand. Specific attention will be giv n to M1 and M2 stocks and velocities, th Fed Funds Rate and National Income, and how their interaction with each other has been affectrd by technology development. Using Electronic Fund Transfer and Automated Teller Machine introduction as a proxy or current technological development in a cointegration test model it is found that current payment technologies have had mixed effects on money supply and demand, and the interaction between their associated factor within the IS-LM framework Section II summarizes the existing literature concerning payments technology and their impact on the economy. Section IIl details the resulting theory and hypothe is. Section IV introduces the empirical model used to te t the hypothesis and Section V present the results of these models.Section VI concludes the study, presenting possible implications and directions for further research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Predicting the Divorce Decisions of Young Women Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith &#39;96, Angela A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Over recent decades, we have witnessed drastic changes in American family structure.  Previous studies, such as those performed by Gary Becker (1991) and Manser and Brown (1980) have applied economic models to divorce and other family structure decisions.  Building on the utility maximization analysis of Manser and Brown, as adapted by John Ermisch (1993), this study uses a logit regression analysis to predict divorce decisions for an all female sample of respondents, ages 28 to 36.  Data are extracted from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for this analysis.  Economic theory predicts that the probability of divorce is directly related to one&#39;s opportunity cost to being married.  Using a woman&#39;s estimated wage rate as a proxy for the economic portion of this opportunity cost, this study hypothesizes that the probability of a woman seeking divorce will increase with increases in her potential wage rate, holding total family income constant.  The empirical results of the study support this hypothesis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exchange Rate Variability and its Effect on Trade: a Case Study of the CFA Free Trade Zone</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alexander &#39;96, Gwendolyn M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Since the fall of the Bretton Woods agreement and the rise of a floating exchange rate regime, there has been a marked increase in the volatility of exchange rates. The movement of exchange rates relative to other currencies, or exchange rate variability is seen as a risk by importers and exporters. The uncertainty surrounding exchange rate movements affects importers and exporters who must determine domestic prices of traded goods without knowing how the exchange rate will move between the time an order is placed and the time payment is due. Theory supports that as exchange rate variability increases, ceteris paribus, international trade will fall.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cumulative Voting and Single Member Districts in Industrial Organization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yount &#39;95, Joshua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In 1993 Bill Clinton nominated Lani Guinier to head the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. Soon after, Guinier&#39;s nomination became embroiled in controversy when the media and conservative legislators began to examine her writings on electoral remedies to Voting Rights Act violations. Almost immediately, Lani Guinier became known as the &#34;quota queen&#34; and her writings were derided as undemocratic and racially preferential. Still smarting from &#34;nanny-gate,&#34; President Clinton quickly moved to avoid further attacks and withdrew Guinier&#39;s nomination. Foremost among the charges raised against Guinier was that her advocation of cumulative voting as an alternative to districting as a remedy for minority voting strength dilution represented an affront to democracy and was designed to unfairly advantage minorities. Unfortunately, the truth was somehow lost in the fury of political maneuvering and press sensationalism.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Empirical study of Covered Interest Arbitrage: Marqins Durinq the European Monetary System Crisis of 1992</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Saarinen &#39;94, Ossi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Interest parity in international financial markets exists when the interest rate differential between two counties is exactly offset by the forward exchange premium/discount. If at any moment the interest parity condition is not satisfied, traders can execute covered interest arbitrage. Covered interest arbitrage entails a series of four transactions in the currency and securities markets which results in a practically riskless profit. Although traditional economic theory predicts that the opportunities will be wiped out as individuals take advantage of the situation, covered interest. arbitrage margins (ClAMs) have been observed to exist over extended periods of time.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Estimating the Risk of Third World Debt</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chadesh &#39;90, Jane</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In August 1982, Mexico announced that it was unable to meet its debt obligations then falling due. Since this announcement more than 40 countries have been forced to reschedule on debt owed to commercial banks. Commercial banks have been criticized for blindly providing the lesser developed countries (LDCs) more credit and exposing themselves to more and more risk. For example, six months prior to Mexico&#39;s announcement that it could not meet its debt obligations, Mexico had been granted 6.4 billion dollars in new loans to make a total of 84 billion dollars in loans that needed to be rescheduled. If commercial banks had had more information on the credit risk of the LDCs, they could have foreseen such an event and taken some precautions, such as curtailing lending, to minimize their losses. Increased information on the riskiness of LDC debt could be extremely useful to commercial banks when making lending decisions or provisions. The purpose of this research is to estimate the risk associated with LDC debt, and to determine the variables which are significant in assessing this risk.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Integration of Capital Markets: A Study of Market Integration Principles and the Effects of Macroeconomic Shocks on National Stock Market Comovements</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kaneta &#39;00, Kristopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Traditionally, international investors seek to determine whether international capital markets are integrated or segmented. That is, do similar assets yield similar risk adjusted returns, or significantly different returns given certain informational and capital flow barriers? With this in mind, this research chooses to focus on the rapidly developing financial markets of Southeast Asia and determine the degree to which international stock market movements may be correlated with each other. Through panel data and OLS regression analysis, the research will show an increasing correlation between these capital markets over time, and the significant impact certain macroeconomic variables may have on capital markets. Included in the analysis are the effects of capital flow barriers, economic development, exchange rate regimes, and discount rate differentials.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Causes and Effects of Welfare Dependency</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bisaillon &#39;93, Chris</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The effect of welfare on work incentives has been a hotly debated topic since its inception in 1935. My research project examines the work incentive effects of an important component of the welfare system, namely Aid to Families with Dependent Children. I have done this by analyzing data drawn from a massive database of 12,800 youths called the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. I primarily use two theories for my analysis, the neoclassical theory of labor supply and the welfare-disincentive theory promoted by Charles Murray. These two theories allow me to formulate and test a number of hypotheses regarding the determinants of welfare dependency. The empirical part of the paper has two purposes. The first is to identify attitudes and background characteristics that are related to welfare dependency. The second purpose is to determine how AFDC dependency in the early 1980&#39;s affects labor force participation, poverty, and net income in the late 1980&#39;s. For the most part, the results of my study reinforced my research hypotheses. For example, individuals who were AFDC dependent in the early 1980&#39;s experienced economic difficulties in the late 1980&#39;s such as, a higher incidence of poverty, lower net incomes, and fewer hours of labor supplied. The study also identified factors which make one more likely to become welfare dependent.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cultural Wage Differentials Among United States Immigrants</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Takahashi &#39;96, William J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>One ofthe most debated political and social issues in contemporary America is that of immigration. As a nation ofimmigrants and descendants ofimmigrants, the United States is grappling with the conflict over whether or not continued immigration will prove to be beneficial or detrimental to the economy and society. Immigration is an issue as old as the United States itself, yet it seems as though this generation of leaders is more determined than ever to make lasting changes in the policy concerning immigration. Some argue that a consistent inflow ofdiverse and talented human beings will advance the nation&#39;s economy as it has in the past while others see immigration as a drain on resources and propose not only restricting immigration but also physically eliminating it by building walls and fences. While both sides ofthe debate have different facets that are appealing to the American public, there is a consistency that has developed between the two arguments. Successful immigrants are tolerated at a much greater level than immigrants who have difficulty integrating into American society. This project will attempt to take a modem snapshot ofthe ongoing process ofimmigration and cultural diversification within the specific economic context ofthe United States labor market. It will then examine the problem ofimmigrant adaptation into the American way oflife and explore which immigrants, if any, have an advantage when it comes to integrating into American society.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Inflation in the European Community: A Study Before and After German Unification</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chalstrom &#39;94, Ann C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During the last half of the twentieth century, the global economy has been undergoing monumental change, as the world is dividing into three regional economic zones: the Pacific rim; North America.; and, the European Community (EC). Though it is important to analyze the relationships between these three economic players, it is also ~ecessary to study the relationships among the member nations of each bloc to determine the effect on the nations participating in the bloc as well as the activities of the single; unit. The tight economic relationship formed when several sovereign nations form a union, like the EC, has a great impact on each country&#39;s domestic economic policies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Test of the Environmental Kuznets Curve For Local and Global Pollutants</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Meers &#39;00, Robin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The early stages of economic development are generally associated with increases in the level of industrialization. Along with this industrialization comes increases in populations of cities and pollution causing transportation. For all these reasons, the development of a country is usually associated with increases in the amount of pollution. However, after a certain threshold level of income, the quality of the environment becomes important and people are willing to pay for a cleaner environment. After this point the level of pollution is likely to decrease. This hypothesized inverted-U relationship between the amount of pollution and the income of a country is known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). It is an important idea because, if true, it would enable people to predict the levels of pollution for the corning years based on a countries expected GDP (Shafik).</dc:description>

<dc:description>No one disputes that a male-female gender wage differential favoring men exists. This study seeks to unearth not only the sources of this differential but also the relative degrees to which the various sources impact the differential. The theories proposed by current literature suggest three principal causes: differences in human capital, crowding discrimination, and other forms of discrimination. This study estimates separate equations for men and women and then uses the regression results to decompose the gender wage differential into the three aforementioned components. We find, after isolating the effects of differences in individual human capital and choice characteristics as well as differences due to crowding, the residual surprisingly accounts for the largest proportion of the gender wage gap. Because the residual is so large, we believe that basic discrimination models must still be necessary and useful. Moreover, when one considers that the human capital differences that do exist may be reflecting feedback effects, the justification for combating societal stereotyping of gender roles becomes even stronger, to promote not only equity but also efficiency in today&#39;s labor market.</dc:description>
