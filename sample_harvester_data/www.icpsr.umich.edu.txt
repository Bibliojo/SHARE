          <dc:description>This data collection provides the names of candidates, political party name and ICPSR party ID code, and the number of votes received by each candidate in the constituency for elections between 1788 and 1990. The data include county-level returns for over 90 percent of all elections to the offices of president, governor, United States representative (1824-1990), and United States senator (1912-1990). The dataset also includes returns for approximately two-thirds of all elections to the offices of president, governor, and United States representative for the period 1788-1823. Returns for one additional statewide office are included beginning with the 1968 elections. Also presented are 1990 data from the District of Columbia election for United States senator and United States representative. The offices of two senators and one representative were created by the "District of Columbia Statehood Constitutional Convention Initiative," which was approved by District voters in 1980. Elections for these offices were postponed until the 1990 general election. The three offices are currently local District positions, which will turn into federal offices if the District becomes a state.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>Roll call voting records for both chambers of the United States Congress through the second session of the 105th Congress are presented in this data collection. Each data file in the collection contains information for one chamber of a single Congress. The units of analysis in each part are the individual members of Congress. Each record contains a member's voting action on every roll call vote taken during that Congress, along with variables that identify the member (e.g., name, party, state, district, uniform ICPSR member number, and most recent means of attaining office). In addition, the codebook provides descriptive information for each roll call, including the date of the vote, outcome in terms of nays and yeas, name of initiator, the relevant bill or resolution number, and a synopsis of the issue.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study contains national data prepared for the Data Confrontation Seminar on the Use of Ecological Data in Comparative Cross-National Research held under the auspices of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research on April 1-18, 1969. One of the primary concerns of this international seminar was the need for cooperation in the development of data resources in order to facilitate exchange of data between individual scholars and research groups. This data collection contains returns for all elections for 3,143 counties of 50 states of the United States to the offices of president, senator and representative, and governor, ecological data drawn from various United States censuses from 1947 to 1965, and selected data from the 1952 National Council of Churches Survey of church membership. It contains a merged set of data at the county, state, and congressional district levels for the 1950s and 1960s. The data are organized in three parts: (1) election returns and ecological data in raw form, (2) percentagized party votes and ecological data, and (3) series of derived measures and additional computations. Data on election returns include votes for the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as for other minor parties for the period 1949-1968. Data on ecology provide information on total population, urbanization, industries, housing, and sex and age distribution. Other demographic variables include education, religion, employment, and income.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study contains data for 51 communities with populations of 50,000-750,000 in 22 states of the United States on the characteristics of community leadership, decision-making, and patterns of influence, as well as political, economic, and demographic composition of the communities and per capita expenditures for various common community functions. Information regarding general political and public policy issues, specific municipal problems, and their solutions was obtained from interviews with eight prominent individuals in each city, such as the Chamber of Commerce president, a labor leader, a leading newspaper editor or publisher, the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican parties, the president of the largest bank, and the mayor. Data are also provided on the characteristics of the cities, including composite indexes created from the interview data as well as data from other sources. The study is composed of three files: a Merged Aggregate and Individual file (Part 1), an Aggregate file (Part 2), and an Individual file (Part 3). The Merged Aggregate and Individual file (Part 1) contains the responses of the individuals interviewed and information on the characteristics of each respondent's city from other sources. Items include education, health, culture, welfare, and total expenditures of the city. The Aggregate file (Part 2) contains information on the population characteristics of each city, as well as information on the structure, income, and expenditures of the city government. Demographic indices describe age and income distribution of the population, racial composition, level of educational attainment, and the size, income and occupational distribution of the labor force. The Individual file (Part 3) provides information received from respondents on decision-making pertaining to issues of urban renewal, mayoral elections, air pollution control, race relations, health, education, industrial and economic development, and anti-poverty programs.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study contains data relevant to 166 community power studies conducted from 1920 to 1964. The goal of the data collection was to afford comparative analyses of these selected communities by any interested future researchers. Information is provided on the theoretical and methodological apparatus of the research, such as the major data collection techniques and the model of power utilized in the investigation. Additional information is given for the primary purpose of the research, the number of communities and the mode of entry into the communities studied, the number and scope of issues studied, the level of theoretical rigor, and the replicability of the study. Other variables provide information on the community power structure, formal structure, and characteristics of politics in the communities, such as the type of local government, electoral systems established, forms of formal and informal structures of power, political party dominating local politics, community conflict resolution, sources of innovation, and the place of experts, elite groups, masses, voters, and minorities in the community. There are also variables that provide information on the type of community and city, city rating, growth of the city, type of relationship between population growth and industrial growth, and population growth rate and population size of the city per square mile. Variables on the economic base of the community include the median income for the city in 1950 and in 1960, and the proportion of the population earning under $2,000 and under $3,000 in 1950, and over $10,000 in 1960. Demographic variables on the city's residents cover the education of the population in relation to the United States median, the median age from 1950 to 1960, the proportion of the population under 5 years, over 21 years, and under 65 years of age, and the proportion of the population that was non-white in any census year, of mixed parentage in 1960 in (where one parent was of foreign birth), and foreign-born between 1910 and 1960. Data are also provided on the researchers' sex, educational institutions attended, motivation for the research, and their publications based on the research findings.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study is a 40-year time series of social, economic, and political indicators at the national level for the United States in the period 1929-1968. The variables include data on expenditures from the federal budget by various departments, agencies, and commissions, the number of employees in the various United States departments, measures of the political characteristics of the United States Congress, such as the number of Repuplicans, Democrats, and "other" party members in the United States Senate and in the House of Representatives, business and consumer expenditures, and attributes of the population. Data are also provided on the number per 1,000 of immigrants to the United States, membership of all the religious bodies in the United States, labor union membership, total households in the United States, total civilian labor force, and the number of the unemployed. Demographic variables provide information on education, births, and death rates. The unit of analysis is the year. Variables 2-281 cover the period from 1929-1968 and Variables 282-408 cover only the period from 1947-1968.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This data collection provides information on the demographic, social, economic, political, and civil characteristics of selected municipalities with populations of 25,000 or more in the United States during the 1960s. Information is provided on population characteristics, such as the number of native-born persons residing in the state of birth, percentage of persons aged 5 years and older who were migrants, percentages in 1962 of non-white, foreign-born, and native-born populations of foreign or racially mixed parentage, median school years completed by those aged 25 years and older, percentage of elementary school children in private school, median income of families, number of full-time city employees per 1,000 population, percentage of civilian labor force that was unemployed in 1960, percentage of employed persons in white-collar occupations and in manufacturing industries, and percentage of the employed civilian labor force that was professional and that were managers, officials, and proprietors. Other variables provide information on city characteristics, such as the age of the city, the presence of dormitory city, balanced city, central city, independent city, and the suburbs, the density of population per square mile, the employment-residence ratio, the presence or absence of application for the Model Cities Program, and the number of applications for, and whether the city was a winner of, the All-American City award between 1952 and 1967. Further variables detail information on the city housing situation, such as the number of dwelling units built in 1929 or earlier, the number of dilapidated dwellings, the presence or absence of a local housing authority and jurisdiction of local housing authority, participation in programs of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Public Law 412), the presence or absence of a low-rent housing program and of slum clearance, and the number of low-rent housing units per 100,000 population. Additional variables give information on city politics, including the presence of mayor-council government, city-manager government, and nonpartisan elections, the number of city councilmen, the percentage of city council elected at large, the percentage of the county presidential vote for the Democratic party and for the Republican party in 1960, and the numbers of registered voters. Other items cover city services and programs, such as the presence or absence of poverty programs, the number of dollars per capita for poverty programs as of June 30, 1966, the presence or absence of urban renewal programs and their execution or completion as of June 30, 1966, the current per capita amount raised for Community Chest, and the presence or absence of action on fluoridation of city water. There are also variables that identify a subset of cities for urban renewal analysis, Community Chest analysis, analysis of fluoridation decisions, and analysis of decisions about public housing.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This data collection contains three files of county-level electoral returns for Ohio, Michigan, Nebraska, and New York in the period 1912, and 1920-1940. The data files were prepared for instructional use in the ICPSR Training Program and for graduate-level social science courses at the University of Michigan and other university campuses. They contain social, demographic, electoral, and economic data for various areas of the United States, usually for an extended period of time. Part 1, Ohio Referenda Counties as Units, and Part 2, Ohio Referenda as Units, consist of county-level returns for 42 referenda in the 1912 general election in Ohio. Data are provided for the names of counties, votes in the affirmative, total number of votes, and percentage of the "yes" votes for referenda on issues such as civil juries, capital punishment, governor's veto, workmen's compensation, 8-hour day, removal of elected officials, prison labor, women's suffrage, and taxes. The referenda included many questions considered important in the Progressive Movement. Part 3, Data Sets for Three States (Michigan, Nebraska, and New York), consists of electoral returns for the offices of president, governor, and United States representative, as well as ecological and population characteristics data in the period 1920-1940. Data are provided for the raw votes and percentage of the total votes received by the Democratic, Republican, Progressive, and other parties.

Data for Canada provide information for all provinces for the decades 1900-1960 on population characteristics, such as national origin, the net internal migration per 1,000 of native population, population density per square mile, the percentage of owner-occupied dwellings, the percentage of urban population, the percentage of change in population from preceding censuses, the percentage of illiterate population aged 5 years and older, and the median years of schooling. Economic variables provide information on per capita personal income, total provincial revenue and expenditure per capita, the percentage of the labor force employed in manufacturing and in agriculture, the average number of employees per manufacturing establishment, assessed value of real property per capita, the average number of acres per farm, highway and rural road mileage, transportation and communication, the number of telephones per 100 population, and the number of motor vehicles registered per 1,000 population. Additional variables on elections and votes are supplied as well. Data for France provide information for all departements for all legislative elections since 1936, the two presidential elections of 1965 and 1969, and several referenda held in the period since 1958. Social and economic data are provided for the years 1946, 1954, and 1962, while various policy data are presented for the period 1959-1962.

Economic variables focus on the Gross National Product (GNP), the revenue per capita per household, personal income per capita, income tax, the percentage of active population in industry, construction and public works, transportation, hotels, public administration, and other jobs, the percentage of skilled and unskilled industrial workers, the number of doctors per 10,000 population, the number of agricultural cooperatives in 1946, the average hectares per farm, the percentage of farms cultivated by the owner, tenants, and sharecroppers, the number of workhorses, cows, and oxen per 100 hectares of farmland in 1946, and the percentages of automobiles per 1,000 population, radios per 100 homes, and cinema seats per 1,000 population. Data are also provided on the percentage of Communists (PCF), Socialists, Radical Socialists, Conservatives, Gaullists, Moderates, Poujadists, Independents, Turnouts, and other political groups and parties in elections 1946-1969. Additional variables provide information on medical insurance, death benefits, and aid to families. Data for Mexico provide information for all states at decennial points from 1910 to 1960. Social and economic data are available for the entire period, while political and public policy data are presented for the decades beginning with 1930. Variables are provided on population size, population density per kilogram, the percentage of illiterate population, the percentage increase in population by decade, the percentage of economically active population, the total per capita state revenues and expenditures, per capita personal income, median family income, minimum salary in city and in countryside, the poverty index in percentages, the average number of employees per industrial firm, the average investment per manufacturing establishment, the value of industrial and agricultural products in pesos per capita, the average number of hectares per farm, gasoline consumption in litres per capita, and the number of telephones and of registered motor vehicles per 1,000 population.

          <dc:description>For this study of political systems performance, time-series data were compiled for France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom on a quinquennial basis for the period 1850-1965. Information is provided for each country on population characteristics, such as the number of total population, the number of total population aged 0 to 4, 0 to 14, and 65 and older, births per 1,000 population, life expectancy, deaths per 1,000 population, infant deaths per 1,000 live births, the number of pupils enrolled in elementary and secondary schools, the number of students enrolled in colleges and universities, the number of teachers in secondary schools, and the number of civil servants, doctors, midwives, and hospital beds. Economic variables provide information on the Gross National Product (GNP), price index, number of patents issued, energy consumption, maximum income tax rate, government revenue from income tax, amount of public debt in millions, total public expenditures on defense, education, pension, welfare, health, veterans' benefits, and labor, labor union membership, the number of total work force employed in agriculture, the amount of agricultural production, the percentage of working-age population unemployed, the number of people on welfare, and the number of people receiving public pensions. Additional variables provide information on the voting population, the population voting for left-wing parties, population residing in cities over 20,000 in size, and population residing in the three largest cities. Three political indexes, the Cutright Index of Political Development, the Flanigan-Fogelman Index of Democratization, and an index indicating the ideology of the regime for each year, are also provided for the purpose of crossnational comparisons.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This study contains selected electoral and demographic national data for nine nations in the 1950s and 1960s. The data were prepared for the Data Confrontation Seminar on the Use of Ecological Data in Comparative Cross-National Research held under the auspices of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research on April 1-18, 1969. One of the primary concerns of this international seminar was the need for cooperation in the development of data resources in order to facilitate exchange of data among individual scholars and research groups. Election returns for two or more national and/or local elections are provided for each of the nine nations, as well as ecological materials for at least two time points in the general period of the 1950s and 1960s. While each dataset was received at a single level of aggregation, the data have been further aggregated to at least a second level of aggregation. In most cases, the data can be supplied at the commune or municipality level and at the province or district level as well.

          <dc:description>This data collection contains electoral and demographic data at several levels of aggregation (kreis, land/regierungsberzirk, and wahlkreis) for Germany in the Weimar Republic period of 1919-1933. Two datasets are available. Part 1, 1919 Data, presents raw and percentagized election returns at the wahlkreis level for the 1919 election to the Nationalversammlung. Information is provided on the number and percentage of eligible voters and the total votes cast for parties such as the German National People's Party, German People's Party, Christian People's Party, German Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party, and Independent Social Democratic Party. Part 2, 1920-1933 Data, consists of returns for elections to the Reichstag, 1920-1933, and for the Reichsprasident elections of 1925 and 1932 (including runoff elections in each year), returns for two national referenda, held in 1926 and 1929, and data pertaining to urban population, religion, and occupations, taken from the German Census of 1925. This second dataset contains data at several levels of aggregation and is a merged file. Crosstemporal discrepancies, such as changes in the names of the geographical units and the disappearance of units, have been adjusted for whenever possible. Variables in this file provide information for the total number and percentage of eligible voters and votes cast for parties, including the German Nationalist People's Party, German People's Party, German Center Party, German Democratic Party, German Social Democratic Party, German Communist Party, Bavarian People's Party, Nationalist-Socialist German Workers' Party (Hitler's movement), German Middle Class Party, German Business and Labor Party, Conservative People's Party, and other parties.

Additional variables provide information on occupations in the country, including the number of wage earners employed in agriculture, industry and manufacturing, trade and transportation, civil service, army and navy, clergy, public health, welfare, domestic and personal services, and unknown occupations. Other census data cover the total number of wage earners in the labor force and the number of female wage earners employed in all occupations. Also provided is the percentage of the total population living in towns with 5,000 inhabitants or more, and the number and percentage of the population who were Protestants, Catholics, and Jews.</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This data collection consists of 161 selected social, demographic, and educational datasets for France in the period 1801-1897. The data were collected from published reports of three national statistical series: (1) National Censuses, (2) Vital Statistics, and (3) Primary Education. This project was supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation. The National Census data were derived from the quinquennial population censuses of France from 1801 to 1896 and were obtained from the Statistique Generale de la France. The data provide detailed social and economic information for the period 1851 to 1896. The data for 1801-1851 are less rich in subject matter coverage but do present some basic information on population characteristics. The National Census data in general describe the population, including the composition of the population by categories of age, sex, place of birth, marital status, religion, place of residence, and occupation. There is also some limited information on migration, transportation and communication, housing, and families. A large segment of the census data pertains to occupations of the population, specifying job classifications within professions, as well as information on non-employed household members that were dependent on employees in the various industries, in addition to enumerations of persons employed in various professions and trades. The Vital Statistics data files contain annual vital statistics for the French population. These data were obtained from two printed series, MOUVEMENT DE LA POPULATION (1801-1868), and STATISTIQUE ANNUELLE (1869-1897). The basic variables included in the vital statistics datasets record births, deaths, and marriages in France. Detailed cross-tabulations of these demographic indicators are presented for births, tabulated by sex, month, legitimacy status, and characteristics of the parents, and deaths, categorized by age and previous marital status of the partners. Additional cross-tabulations are provided for variables such as divorces, passports issued, medical personnel and hospitals, and a literacy indicator (signing of marriage certificates). The Primary Education data files provide information on primary schools and were obtained from the Statistique de l'enseignement Primaire. The data obtained from the series basically cover the period 1829-1897, although some recapitulative information for earlier years is also presented. The main focus of the data in this series is on primary schools, classes and buildings, enrollment, teachers, sources of funding and expenditure, and academic proficiency of the pupils. Additional information is included on literacy, teacher training (normal) schools, school age population, and libraries. A machine-readable French language codebook, describing the data items as well as the sources from which they were obtained, is provided with each dataset supplied. In addition, lists of the variables included in each dataset are included in Parts 162-164. See the related collection, DEMOGRAPHIC, SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC DATA FOR FRANCE, 1833-1925 (ICPSR 7529).</dc:description>

          <dc:description>This detailed study of 578 disturbances in France in the period 1830-1860 and 1930-1960 provides information on the geographic, economic, political, demographic, and historical background for each of the communes involved in the disturbances. Data for the formations, a collective of forces comprising of at least 50 persons in each collective, provide information on their social, economic, and political background, population characteristics, type of formation, age-sex distribution of the formations, and the political party affiliation of its members. The antecedent history of the disturbances is also given, including public memory of previous conflicts, forms of and responses to violence, interactions with other formations, character and clarity of objectives, and extent of territory controlled. Data on the organization of each formation is provided for the leadership, coordination, segmentation, stratification, and differentiation of the formation, as well as the extent of participation in man-days, and the numbers of participants in the disturbances arrested, killed, or wounded. Information is also provided on the outcome of the disturbance and changes resulting from participation in the disturbances. Additional variables provide detailed descriptions of the magnitude, duration, objectives, and immediate consequences of the disturbances. Variables also describe the newspaper, archival, and secondary sources used in the coding of the data collection.</dc:description>
