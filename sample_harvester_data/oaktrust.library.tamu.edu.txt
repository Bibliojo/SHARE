<dc:description>Spacecraft missions such as spacecraft docking and formation flying require high precision relative position and attitude data. Although Global Positioining Systems  can provide this capability near the earth, deep space missions require the use of alternative technologies. One such technology is the vision-based navigation (VISNAV) sensor system developed at Texas A&amp;M University. VISNAV comprises an electro-optical sensor combined with light sources or beacons. This patented sensor has an analog detector in the focal plane with a rise time of a few microseconds. Accuracies better than one part in 2000 of the field of view have been obtained. This research presents a new approach involving simultaneous activation of beacons with frequency division multiplexing as part of the VISNAV sensor system. In addition, it discusses the synchronous demodulation process using digital heterodyning and decimating filter banks on a low-power fixed point DSP, which improves the accuracy of the sensor measurements and the reliability of the system. This research also presents an optimal and computationally efficient six-degree-of-freedom estimation algorithm using a new measurement model based on the attitude representation of Modified Rodrigues Parameters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Intraspecific relationships among the anchialine cave shrimp Typhlatya mitchelli were examined by sequencing a total of 1505 bp from portions of three mitochondrial DNA genes.  Cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase I, and 16S rRNA were partially sequenced and analyzed for specimens from six different cenotes (water-filled caves) across the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.  The conspecific Typhlatya pearsei that is sympatric with T. mitchelli was also sequenced and used as the outgroup.  Comparisons among specimens of T. mitchelli yielded low sequence divergence values (0-1.7%), with the majority being less than 0.4%.  Phylogenetic tree topologies reconstructed with neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony were in agreement in regards of the resolution of deep branches.  Also, there was no obvious geographic differentiation among the majority of T. mitchelli samples, with the exception of specimens from Cenote San Antonio Chiich (Yokdzonot, Yucatan, Mexico) which all clustered into an extremely well supported monophyletic group.  The level of differentiation of this group, together with the nearly total absence of differentiation among T. mitchelli from distant cave systems, suggests that this is an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU), which may correspond to a new species.  This unidentified Typhlatya from Cenote San Antonio Chiich was helpful in establishing a period in which the epigean ancestor colonized the cenotes.  Based on pairwise distance data and previously published shrimp molecular clocks (Baldwin et al., 1998), T. mitchelli and the putative new Typhlatya species last shared a common ancestor between 3-5 million years ago (mya), during the mid-Pliocene era, while T. mitchelli and T. pearsei was approximately 7-10 mya (middle to late Miocene).  The ancestor to T. mitchelli and the unidentified Typhlatya species abandoned its shallow coastal water existence in the early Pliocene and eventually expanded its range across the peninsula.  Approximately 4 mya, Cenote San Antonio Chiich became isolated from the remaining gene pool thereby halting gene flow.  As the regional water table fluctuated in response to the rise and fall of Pleistocene sea levels, T. mitchelli actively colonized the peninsula.  The discovery of a single, continuous subterranean freshwater system provides for a better understanding of anchialine biogeography within the Yucatan Peninsula.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>mooring</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A numerical scheme, known as CABLE3D, originally developed for the simulation of dynamics of steel chain-wire mooring lines is extended to allow for the large elongation in a mooring line, the dependence of the modulus on tension, and energy dissipation of a polyester rope under mean and cyclic loads. The modified CABLE3D is then integrated into a numerical package, known as COUPLE6D, for computing the interaction between a floating structure and its hybrid polyester mooring system. The Deepstar Spar is chosen in this study to represent the floating structure. &#xd;
By considering large elongation in polyester ropes in numerical simulation, the static offset curve of a polyester mooring system is softer than that calculated under the assumption of small elongation. That is, about 10% reduction in restoring force at the mean offset position of the Spar under the impact of 100-year hurricane storm. The effects of the mean loads on the modulus of polyester ropes are much greater than those of the dynamic loads. Hence, the former is more important in the simulation of the response of floating structures. The energy dissipation in polyester ropes under cyclic loading does not play significant roles in the responses of the Spar and tensions in a polyester mooring system. The above findings, although observed based on the numerical simulation of a particular floating structure, namely Spar, may have implications to other floating offshore structures moored by a polyester mooring system. &#xd;
Two systems are simulated in two different met-ocean conditions: hurricane and loop current condition. To study the properties of polyester, numerical simulation were conducted in three ways. Those are related to the modulus based on mean load, mean and dynamic loads, and structural damping respectively. Through the simulation, statistics of motions of the hull and tension in the mooring lines are compared with those of a conventional steel mooring system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis presents numerical predictions for the leakage and direct stiffness coefficients of pocket damper seals.  Modifications made to earlier flow-prediction models are discussed. Leakage and static pressure measurements on straight-through and diverging configurations of eight-bladed and twelve-bladed seals were used for code validation and for calculation of seal discharge coefficients.  Higher than expected leakage rates were measured in the case of the twelve-bladed seal, while the leakage rates for the eight-bladed seals were predicted reasonably accurately.  Results are presented for shake tests conducted on the seals at pressures of up to 1000 Psi (6.90 MPa). Test variables included pressure drop across the seals and rotor speed. The experimentally obtained stiffness coefficients are compared to results of a rotordynamic damper seal code, which uses the corrected mass flow-rate calculation method. Results show that the code under-predicts the magnitude of the seal's stiffness for most test cases. However, general trends in the frequency dependency of the direct stiffness are more accurately predicted.  The expectation of high values of negative stiffness in diverging seals is confirmed by the results, but the frequency at which the sign of the stiffness becomes positive is considerably lower than is predicted.  In addition to presenting high-pressure test data, this thesis also attempts to provide some insight into how seal parameters can be modified to obtain desired changes in seal stiffness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation is composed of three parts of major contributions.&#xd;
In Chapter II, we discuss analytical study of contaminant transport from a finite source in a finite-thickness aquifer. This chapter provides&#xd;
analytical solutions of contaminant transport from one-, two-, and three-dimensional finite sources in a finite-thickness aquifer using Green's function method.  A library of unpublished analytical solutions with different finite source geometry is provided.  A graphically integrated software CTINT is developed to calculate the temporal integrations in the analytical solutions and obtain the final solutions of concentration.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter III, we obtained solutions of groundwater flow to a finite-diameter horizontal well including wellbore storage and skin effect&#xd;
in a three-dimensionally anisotropic leaky aquifer. These solutions improve previous line source solutions by considering realistic well geometry and offer better description of drawdown near the horizontal well. These solutions are derived on the basis of the separation of the source and the geometric functions.  The graphically integrated computer program FINHOW is written to generate type curves of groundwater flow to a finite-diameter&#xd;
horizontal well. The influence of the finite-diameter of the well, the wellbore storage, the skin effect, the leakage parameter, and the aquifer anisotropy is thoroughly analyzed.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Chapter IV, a general theory of groundwater flow to a fractured or non-fractured aquifer considering wellbore storage and skin effect is&#xd;
provided.  Solutions for both leaky confined and water table aquifers are provided.  The fracture model used in this study is the standard double-porosity model.  The storage of the aquitard (the leaky confining layer) is included in the formula.  A program denoted FINHOW2 is written to&#xd;
facilitate the calculation.  Sensitivity of the solution to the confined versus unconfined conditions, fractured versus non-fractured conditions, and wellbore storage and skin effects is analyzed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Tamaulipan Biotic Province (TBP) is an ecotonal community that has been characterized in the twentieth century as a mixture of plains, woodland, and desert-adapted mammalian taxa. Some authors have proposed that this heterogeneous mixture of animals is a result of human influence on the environment in the post-European contact period.  Others have proposed that the characteristically disharmonious mixture of fauna has been present in south Texas since prehistory.  By considering the presence of certain key taxa across the archaeological record of the area this thesis demonstrates that the fauna characteristic of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province can be followed back in time as far as the archaeological record allows.  This work also provides complete lists of all vertebrate organisms present in the archaeological record of the area, organized by time period and also by archaeological site and citation.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Tortilla staling</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>amylopectin recrystallization</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>maltogenic amylase</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>CMC</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Antistaling properties of enzymes (xylanase, bacterial maltogenic and conventional a-amylases), CMC and vital wheat gluten on corn tortillas were evaluated during storage for up to 21 days. Effect of storage time (0-21 days) and temperature (-40, -20, 3, 10 and 21 oC) on tortilla staling was evaluated with or without additives.&#xd;
Addition of 275-1650 AU of ICS maltogenic amylase effectively reduced amylopectin retrogradation without reducing tortilla yields, but did not improve tortilla flexibility. &#xd;
The combination of 825 AU of ICS amylase (to interfere with intra-granular amylopectin re-crystallization) and 0.25% CMC (to create a more flexible inter-granular matrix than retrograded amylose) produced less stiff, equally flexible and less chewy tortillas than 0.5% CMC.&#xd;
Corn tortilla staling followed the basic laws that control aging in starch-based semi-crystalline systems such as starch gels, bread and other baked products. Amylopectin re-crystallization was the driving force behind the staling of corn tortillas. Increasing levels of re-crystallized amylopectin measured by DSC correlated significantly with increased tortilla stiffness and reduction in tortilla rollability, pliability and rupture distance during storage. &#xd;
Re-crystallization of amylopectin in fresh tortillas was not detected. It increased rapidly during the first 24 hr reaching a plateau after 7 days storage. The level of amylopectin re-crystallization on tortillas showed a bell-shaped trend along the evaluated storage temperature range with a maximum around 7 oC.&#xd;
However, a negative linear relationship of peak pasting viscosity with storage temperature of tortilla extracts without additives after 21 days suggests other compounds besides amylopectin affect tortilla staling. Thus, interfering with amylopectin re-crystallization is not the only way to retard staling.&#xd;
Further research is required to optimize the addition of maltogenic amylases in continuous processing lines that use fresh masa instead of nixtamalized corn flour, to determine how these amylases interfere with amylopectin re-crystallization and to elucidate if amylose retrogradation continues during storage and plays a role in tortilla staling.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research pursues the use of powerful BDD-based functional circuit analysis to evaluate some approaches to test set generation.  Functional representations of the circuit allow the measurement of information about faults that is not directly available through circuit simulation methods, such as probability of random detection and test-space overlap between faults.  I have created a software tool that performs experiments to make such measurements and augments existing test generation strategies with this new information.  Using this tool, I explored the relationship of fault model difficulty to test set length through fortuitous detection, and I experimented with the application of function-based methods to help reconcile the traditionally opposed goals of making test sets that are both smaller and more effective.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Approximation and interpolation employing radial basis functions has &#xd;
found important applications  since the early 1980's in areas such &#xd;
as signal processing, medical imaging, as well as neural networks.  &#xd;
Several applications demand that certain physical properties be &#xd;
fulfilled, such as a function being divergence free. No such class &#xd;
of radial basis functions that reflects these physical properties &#xd;
was known until 1994, when Narcowich and Ward introduced a family of &#xd;
matrix-valued radial basis functions that are divergence free.  They &#xd;
also obtained error bounds and stability estimates for interpolation &#xd;
by means of these functions.  These divergence-free functions are &#xd;
very smooth, and have unbounded support.  In this thesis we &#xd;
introduce a new class of matrix-valued radial basis functions that are &#xd;
divergence free as well as compactly supported.  This leads to the &#xd;
possibility of applying fast solvers for inverting interpolation &#xd;
matrices, as these matrices are not only symmetric and positive &#xd;
definite, but also sparse because of this compact support.  We develop &#xd;
error bounds and stability estimates which hold for a broad class of &#xd;
functions.  We conclude with applications to the numerical solution of &#xd;
the Navier-Stokes equation for certain incompressible fluid flows.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The theory of interpolation and approximation of solutions to&#xd;
differential and integral equations on spheres has attracted&#xd;
considerable interest in recent years; it has also been applied&#xd;
fruitfully in fields such as physical geodesy, potential theory,&#xd;
oceanography, and meteorology.&#xd;
In this dissertation we study the approximation of linear&#xd;
partial differential equations on spheres, namely a class of&#xd;
elliptic partial differential equations&#xd;
and the heat equation on the unit sphere.&#xd;
The shifts of a spherical basis&#xd;
function are used to construct the approximate solution. In the&#xd;
elliptic case, both the finite element method and the collocation method&#xd;
are discussed. In the heat equation, only the collocation method is&#xd;
considered. Error estimates in the supremum norms and the Sobolev norms&#xd;
are obtained when certain regularity conditions are imposed on&#xd;
the spherical basis functions.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>histone deacetylation</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Epigenetic regulation is a mechanism by which heritable changes in gene expression are controlled by chromatin status rather than primary DNA sequence.  Changes in chromatin structure affect accessibility of DNA elements to the transcriptional machinery and thus affect transcription activity of the gene.  A key event in this process is reversible modification of core histones, which is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDs, HDAs, or HDACs).  In general, histone deacetylation is related to transcriptional gene silencing, whereas acetylation is associated with gene activation.To study the role of histone deacetylase in plant gene regulation and development, we generated constitutive antisense histone deacetylase 1 (CASH) transgenic plants.  AtHD1 is a homolog of RPD3 protein, a global transcriptional regulator in yeast.  Expression of the antisense AtHD1 caused dramatic reduction in endogenous AtHD1 transcription, resulting in accumulation of acetylated histones.  Down-regulation of histone deacetylation caused a variety of growth and developmental abnormalities and ectopic expression of tissue-specific genes.  However, changes in genomic DNA methylation were not detected in repetitive DNA sequences in the transgenic plants.We also identified a T-DNA insertion line in exon 2 of AtHD1 gene (athd1-t1), resulting in a null allele at the locus.  The complete inhibition of the AtHD1 expression induced growth and developmental defects similar to those of CASH transgenic plants.  The phenotypic abnormalities were heritable across the generations in the mutants.  When the athd1-t1/athd1-t1 plants were crossed to wild-type plants, the mutant phenotype was corrected in the F1 hybrids, which correlated with the AtHD1 expression and reduction of histone H4 Lys12 acetylation.  Microarray analysis was applied to determine genome-wide changes in transcriptional profiles in the athd1-t1 mutant.  Approximately 6.7% (1,753) of the genes were differentially expressed in leaves between the wild-type (Ws) and the athd1-t1 mutant, whereas 4.8% (1,263) of the genes were up- or down-regulated in flower buds of the mutant.  These affected genes were randomly distributed across five chromosomes of Arabidopsis and represented a wide range of biological functions.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the activation for a subset of genes was directly associated with changes in acetylation profiles.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Development on the island of Key Largo, Florida, has isolated the Key Largo woodrat (KLWR, Neotoma floridana smalli) on approximately 850 ha of remaining habitat. The KLWR was listed as a federally endangered species in 1984, yet there is still only a limited amount of knowledge about its ecology and population dynamics.  The objective of this study was to produce reliable information on KLWR ecology to aid in its management and recovery.  Specifically, the study examined (1) the trend and status of the KLWR population, (2) KLWR habitat and nesting preferences, (3) the potential of a fatal disease on KLWR, (4) the movements and ranges of the KLWR, and (5) the viability of the KLWR population.  I trapped on 60 (1-ha) grids from March to September 2002 and 10 (1-ha) grids in October 2002 and January, April, and July 2003.  Additionally I radio-collared 17 KLWRs and tracked them from March to November 2002. I estimated the current population of KLWR to be between 26 and 106 individuals. I found KLWR selected young hammock (disturbed > 1971) over medium (disturbed between 1940-1971) and old hammock (disturbed &lt; 1940).  KLWRs selected garbage and rock piles in the young hammock for nesting sites.  From the analysis of 64 raccoon (Procyon lotor) fecal samples, I have no evidence that the potentially fatal raccoon roundworm parasite (Baylisascaris procyonis) was present on Key Largo or had negative impact on the KLWR.  Telemetry data indicated males have larger ranges than females.  Females appear socially tolerant of one another and have significantly smaller ranges than males during the spring and summer breeding season.  Results of a population viability analysis (PVA) using demographic parameters from previous studies and my study projected a high risk of extinction for the KLWR within the next 10 years. I recommend the creation of large continuous blocks of young (disturbed > 1971) habitat and the creation of nesting habitat for the KLWR within these areas.  I would also advocate a large-scale captive breeding and augmentation of the population along with continued research on the limiting factors that are driving the KLWR toward extinction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The trade mechanisms joining the Mycenaean Aegean to the greater Levant have intrigued and eluded Bronze Age scholarship since the earliest discoveries of foreign objects in Mycenaean burials.  In the past decade, topics of interregional trade in the eastern Mediterranean have enjoyed renewed discussions, inspired in no small part by the excavation of the Uluburun shipwreck.  Data generated from the shipwreck is amounting to an extraordinary body of evidence for contact between the Aegean and the Near East.  The proposed Mycenaean presence on board the Uluburun ship requires that the sum of evidence and hypotheses for trade between the two regions be re-examined. By attempting to demonstrate the role the Mycenaeans had performed on the last journey of the Uluburun ship, an important mechanism of trade may be revealed between the Aegean and Semitic worlds.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis explores some new applications in power electronics for supercapacitors. This involves the design and development of dc-dc converters to interface the supercapacitor banks with the rest of the power electronic system. Two applications for supercapacitors are proposed and analyzed. The first application is aimed at high power applications such as motor drives.  The proposed approach compensates the effect of voltage sags in the dc link of typical adjustable speed drives, thus reducing speed fluctuations in the motor and eliminating the possibility of nuisance tripping on the drive control board. The second approach presented in this thesis explores the use of supercapacitors to extend run-time for mobile devices such as laptop computers and hand held devices. Three possible approaches are explored: a) Supercapacitors connected directly across the battery; b) Battery-inductor-supercapacitor connection; and c) Supercapacitor, and battery connected via a DC-DC converter. Analytical models, simulation and experimental results on a typical laptop computer are presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the Permian Basin, strata of Leonardian age typically consist of interbedded carbonates and siliciclastics interpreted to be turbidite deposits. Happy Spraberry Field produces from a 100-foot thick carbonate section in the Lower Clear Fork Formation (Lower Leonardian) on the Eastern Shelf of the Midland Basin. Reservoir facies include oolitic- to-skeletal grainstones and packstones, rudstones and in situ Tubiphytes bindstones. Depositional environments vary from open marine reefs to shallow marine oolitic shoal mounds. Best reservoir rocks are found in the oolitic-skeletal packstones.  Diagenesis occurred in several phases and includes (1) micritization, (2) stabilization of skeletal fragments, (3) recrystallization of lime mud, (4) intense and selective dissolution, (5) precipitation of four different stages of calcite cement, (6) mechanical compaction, (7) late formation of anhydrite and (8) saddle dolomite and (9) replacement by chalcedony. Oomoldic porosity is the dominant pore type in oolitic grainstones and packstones. Incomplete dissolution of some ooids left ring-shaped structures that indicate ooids were originally bi-mineralic. Bacterial sulfate reduction is suggested by the presence of (1) dissolved anhydrite, (2) saddle dolomite, (3) late-stage coarse-calcite cement and (4) small clusters of pyrite.  Diagenetic overprinting on depositional porosity is clearly evident in all reservoir facies and is especially important in the less-cemented parts of the oolitic grainstones where partially-dissolved ooids were subjected to mechanical compaction resulting in "eggshell" remnants. Pore filling by late anhydrite is most extensive in zones where dissolution and compaction were intense.  Finally, a porosity-permeability model was constructed to present variations in oolitic packstone- rudstone-bindstone reservoir rocks. The poroperm model could not be applied to oolitic grainstone intervals because no consistent trends in the spatial distribution of porosity and permeability were identified. Routine core analysis did not produce any reliable value of water saturation (Sw). An attempt to take advantage of wireline log data indicates that the saturation exponent (n) may be variable in this reservoir.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The measurement of pain has had a growing importance in animals for both privately owned animals and those animals involved in clinical research.  Lameness is considered to be 1 aspect of the pain experience.  The ability of a veterinarian to assess lameness during a routine orthopedic examination can be difficult given the short amount of time in which the clinician can observe the animal, and the fact that the animal is in a stressful environment.  Thus, the input of the owner concerning the animal's well-being over an extended time period may be extremely useful to the clinician in assessing the degree of lameness of the animal.  It was the purpose of this study to establish an instrument that was both repeatable and valid in assessing the degree of lameness.  The instrument used was a questionnaire containing 39 questions in a visual analog scale format.  A force platform was used as the gold-standard for detecting mechanical lameness.  Peak vertical, cranial-caudal, and their associated impulses were forces used to determine lameness, along with maximum slope in some cases.  A test-retest measure of repeatability was conducted on a subset of 19 dogs that were confirmed to have less than a 10% change in vertical peak force.  Nineteen of the 39 questions were found to be repeatable based on a Spearman rank correlation.  These 19 questions were then used as predictor variables in several multiple regression models which predicted force plate measurements.  The result was 3 different models each containing 7 independent variables that were thought to be valid representations of the forces measured (vertical peak, vertical impulse, and propulsion peak forces).  Each reduced model was found to fit the data as well as the full model containing all 19 of the repeatable questions.  The composite of 11 questions from the 3 different models was used to calculate a total score.  This total score was found to be significantly correlated with force plate measurements.   These 11 questions should be useful to a clinician in detecting the degree of lameness in the dog.</dc:description>

<dc:description>There is a debate in the philosophy of time over the status of non-present entities.  Do these things exist, and if so, what sorts of things are they?  Recently, the debate has split into two groups, presentists and eternalists.  Presentists hold that no past or future things exist now.  Socrates does not now exist, though he did in the past; my future daughter does not now exist, though she may in the future.  Ontologically, the present is distinct, serving to demarcate all that currently has existence.  As far as the eternalist is concerned, all entities - whether past, present, or future - are equally real.  If it was, is, or will be, it can be found in the eternalist picture of time.  As such, there is no distinct present at which some entities exist while others do not; rather, everything enjoys the same ontological status.  I will be concerned to offer an assessment of the presentist view.  Common objections against presentism will be examined, amplified, and answered where appropriate.  I will not examine the arguments in favor of the presentist view.  Rather, I wish to describe why it is that the eternalist feels compelled to deny presentism.  Ultimately, my goal will be to show that although presentism survives some of the current objections raised against it, it does not survive them all.  Presentism is an interesting, but ultimately unsatisfactory view.  There is a modified form of presentism (call it presentism*) that can meet the objections raised against the original position, and after noting some of the objections raised against presentism, I will sketch the outlines of presentism* in some detail.  I intend to show that presentism* is able to retain what is most valuable about presentism, while also withstanding certain objections that the latter view could not.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The number of subsea production systems placed in deepwater locations in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) has increased significantly in the last ten to fifteen years.  Currently, API-RP2A (2000 a,b) designates the GOM as a low seismic zone, and thus does not require seismic effects to be considered during the design process. However, there have been a number of seismic events with Richter magnitudes between 3.0 and 4.9 that have occurred in this region.  As a result, questions have been raised regarding the seismic performance of deepwater subsea systems. This thesis presents an analytical parametric study where a prototype subsea structure was selected based on a survey of subsea systems.  The baseline analytical model consisted of a single casing embedded in soft clay soils, which supported a lumped mass at a cantilevered height above the soil.  A number of the model characteristics were varied in the parametric study to simulate the structural response of a range of subsea structures.  This thesis discusses the impact of API-RP2A Zone 1 and 2 design seismic demands for the performance of subsea structures.  The results from the subsequent analyses show that the stresses and deflections produced by the Zone 1 and 2 peak ground accelerations fall within the allowable limits.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this work is to investigate the implementation of nitride fuels containing little or no uranium in a fast-spectrum nuclear reactor to reduce the amount of plutonium and minor actinides in spent nuclear fuel destined for the Yucca Mountain Repository.  A two tier recycling strategy is proposed.  Thermal spectrum transmutation systems converted from the existing LWR fleet were modeled for the first tier, and the Japanese fast reactor MONJU was used for the fast-spectrum transmutation.  The modeling was performed with the Monteburns code.  Transmutation performance was investigated as well as delayed neutron fraction, heat generation rates, and radioactivity of the spent material in the short and long term for the different transmutation fuel cycles.

<dc:subject>corticosterone</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This study examined the number of conditioning trials necessary to produce associative nicotine tolerance and the changes in corticosterone levels during the procedures.  Six independent groups of rats (N = 355) were run through tolerance acquisition procedures for 1, 5, or 10 conditioning sessions.  Treatment groups were comprised of animals that received nicotine-environment pairings, animals that received nicotine explicitly unpaired with the drug administration environment, and control groups that received either saline throughout or no treatment.  Three of the groups were tested for nicotine-induced analgesia using the tail-flick and hot-plate assays, and three groups were blood sampled after either nicotine or saline injection.  Pairing of environment with nicotine produced greater tolerance for rats after 5 conditioning sessions in the tail flick and after 10 conditioning sessions in the hot-plate.  Corticosterone levels were elevated in all rats given nicotine.  Rats that received the nicotine-environment pairing showed a conditioned release of corticosterone in response the environment after both 5 and 10 conditioning sessions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the wide-spread adoption of hypermedia systems and the World Wide Web (WWW) in particular, these systems have evolved from simple systems with only textual content to those that incorporate a large content base, which consists of a wide variety of document types. Also, with the increase in the number of users, there has grown a need for these systems to be accessible to a wider range of users. Consequently, the growth of the systems along with the number and variety of users require new presentation and navigation mechanisms for a wider audience. One of the new presentation methods is the audio-only presentation of hypertext content and this research proposes a novel solution to this problem for complex and dynamic systems. The hypothesis is that the proposed Audio Browser is an efficient tool for presenting hypertext in audio format, which will prove to be useful for several applications including browsers for visually-impaired and remote users. The Audio Browser provides audio-only browsing of contents in a Petri-based hypertext system called Context-Aware Trellis (caT). It uses a combination of synthesized speech and pre-recorded speech to allow its user to listen to contents of documents, follow links, and get information about the navigation process. It also has mechanisms for navigating within documents in order to allow users to view contents more quickly.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>fractures frequency Austin Chalk attributes</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Frequency amplitude spectra derived from P-wave seismic data can be used to derive a fracture indicator. This fracture indicator can be used to delineate fracture zones in subsurface layers.&#xd;
        Mapping fractures, that have no vertical offset, is difficult on seismic sections. Fracturing changes the rock properties and therefore the attributes of the seismic data reflecting off the fractured interface, and data passing through the fractured layers. Fractures have a scattering effect on seismic energy reflected from the fractured layer. Fractures attenuate amplitudes of higher frequencies in seismic data preferentially than lower frequencies. The amplitude spectrum of the frequencies in the seismic data shifts towards lower frequencies, when a spectrum from a time window above the fractured layer and below the fractured layer is compared with each other. This shift in amplitudes of frequency spectra can be derived from seismic data and used to indicate fracturing. A method is developed to calculate a parameter t* to measure this change in the frequency spectra for small time windows (100ms) above and below the fractured layer.&#xd;
	The Austin Chalk in South Central Texas is a fractured layer and produces hydrocarbons from fracture zones with the layer (Sweet Spots). 2D and 3D P-wave seismic data are used from Burleson and Austin Counties in Texas to derive the t* parameter. &#xd;
	Case studies are presented for 2D data from Burleson county and 3D data from Austin County. The t* parameter mapped on the 3D data shows a predominant fracture trend parallel to strike. The fracture zones have a good correlation with the faults interpreted on the Top of Austin Chalk reflector. &#xd;
	Production data in Burleson County (Giddings Field) is a proxy for fracturing. Values of t* mapped on the 2D data have a good correlation with the cumulative production map presented in this study.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Linearly Tunable Filter</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Automatic Tuning</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A new tuning scheme for linearly tunable high-Q filters is proposed. The tuning method is based on using the phase information for both frequency and Q factor tuning. There is no need to find out the relationship between a filter's passband magnitude and Q. A gm-C biquadratic filter is designed to demonstrate the proposed tuning circuitry. The project includes a phase locked loop (PLL) based frequency tuning loop, reference clock generator, and differential difference amplifier (DDA) for dealing with frequency and Q factor tuning loop and linearly tunable second order gm-C bandpass filter. Simulation results for a 10 MHz prototype filter using AMI 0.5μm process is presented. The chip testing results show that the automatic frequency tuning error is 2.5% for the 10 MHz case.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objectives of this dissertation were to find a principal domain of promising and technologically feasible reactor physics characteristics for a multi-purpose, modular-sized, lead-cooled, fast neutron spectrum reactor fueled with an advanced uranium-transuranic-nitride fuel and to determine the principal limitations for the design of an autonomous long-term multi-purpose fast reactor (ALM-FR) within the principal reactor physics characteristic domain. The objectives were accomplished by producing a conceptual design for an ALM-FR and by analysis of the potential ALM-FR performance characteristics. The ALM-FR design developed in this dissertation is based on the concept of a secure transportable autonomous reactor for hydrogen production (STAR-H2) and represents further refinement of the STAR-H2 concept towards an economical, proliferation-resistant, sustainable, multi-purpose nuclear energy system. The development of the ALM-FR design has been performed considering this reactor within the frame of the concept of a self-consistent nuclear energy system (SCNES) that satisfies virtually all of the requirements for future nuclear energy systems: efficient energy production, safety, self-feeding, non-proliferation, and radionuclide burning.  The analysis takes into consideration a wide range of reactor design aspects including selection of technologically feasible fuels and structural materials, core configuration optimization, dynamics and safety of long-term operation on one fuel loading, and nuclear material non-proliferation. Plutonium and higher actinides are considered as essential components of an advanced fuel that maintains long-term operation. Flexibility of the ALM-FR with respect to fuel compositions is demonstrated acknowledging the principal limitations of the long-term burning of plutonium and higher actinides. To ensure consistency and accuracy, the modeling has been performed using state-of-the-art computer codes developed at Argonne National Laboratory. As a result of the computational analysis performed in this work, the ALM-FR design provides for the possibility of continuous operation during about 40 years on one fuel loading containing mixture of depleted uranium with plutonium and higher actinides. All reactor physics characteristics of the ALM-FR are kept within technological limits ensuring safety of ultra-long autonomous operation. The results obtained provide for identification of physical features of the ALM-FR that significantly influence flexibility of the design and its applications. The special emphasis is given to existing limitations on the utilization of higher actinides as a fuel component.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The influence of dent imperfections on the elastic stress behavior of cylindrical shells&#xd;
is explored. This problem is of central importance to the prediction of fatigue failure&#xd;
due to dents in petroleum pipelines. Using an approximate technique called the&#xd;
Equivalent Load Method, a semi-analytical model of two-dimensional dent stress&#xd;
behavior is developed. In the three-dimensional situation, decreased dent localization,&#xd;
in particular dent length, and increased dent depth are confirmed to cause dent stress&#xd;
concentration behavior to shift from having a single peak at the dent center to having&#xd;
peaks at the dent periphery. It is demonstrated that the equivalent load method&#xd;
does not predict this shift in stress behavior and cannot be relied upon to analyze&#xd;
relatively small, deep imperfections. The two stress modes of dents are associated&#xd;
with two modes of dent fatigue behavior that have significantly different fatigue lives.&#xd;
A method for distinguishing longer lived Mode P dents from shorter lived Mode C&#xd;
dents based on two measured features of dent geometry is developed and validated.&#xd;
An approach for implementing this analysis in the evaluation of real dents is also&#xd;
suggested.</dc:description>

<dc:description>I here present a combined AVO analysis of P-P and P-S reflection data whose objective is to improve the identification of lithology by estimating the specific values of Poisson's ratio, [sigma], for each rock formation in a given geological model, rather than a contrast between formations.  Limited knowledge on the elastic parameters of a given rock formation and difficulty regarding the availability and processing of P-S data constitute hindrances of lithology identification.  Considering that ocean bottom seismology (OBS) has aided in solving the problem of P-S data availability, limited information on elastic parameters is still a challenge, and the focus of this thesis.  &#xd;
   The present analysis is based on Zoeppritz' solution for the P-P and P-S reflection coefficients, RPP and RPS, with a slight modification.  We used the normalized P-S reflection coefficient; i.e.,&#xd;
R'PS = RPS / sin [theta]   for [theta] > 0,&#xd;
instead of RPS, where [theta] is the incident angle.  By normalizing RPS, we avoid dealing with the absence of converted S-waves at small incident angles and enhance the similar linear behavior of the P-P and normalized P-S reflection coefficients at small angles of incidence.  &#xd;
   We have used the linearity of RPP and R'PS at angles smaller than 35 degrees to simultaneously estimate the average VP/VS ratio, the contrasts of P- and S-wave velocities, and the contrast of density.  Using this information, we solve for Poisson's ratio of each formation, which may enable lithology discrimination.  The feasibility of this analysis was demonstrated using nonlinear synthetic data (i.e., finite-difference data).  The results in estimating Poisson's ratio yielded less than 5 percent error.&#xd;
   We generalize this new combined P-P and P-S AVO analysis for dipping interfaces.  Similarly to the nondipping interface case, our derivations show that the amplitude variation with offset (AVO) of P-P and P-S for a dipping interface can be cast into intercepts and gradients.  However, these intercepts and gradients depend on the angle of the dipping interface.  Therefore, we further generalize our analysis by including a migration step that allows us to find the dipping angle. &#xd;
   Because seismic data is not available in terms of RPP and R'PS, this process includes recovery of reflection coefficients after migrating the data and correcting for geometrical spreading, as done by Ikelle et al. (1986 and 1988).  The combination of all of these steps, namely geometrical-spreading correction, migration, and AVO analysis, is another novelty of this thesis, which leads to finding the specific values of Poisson's ratio of each rock formation directly from the seismic data.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Beamfilling error is one of the main error sources for microwave oceanic rainfall retrieval. An accurate beamfilling correction can improve the rainfall retrieval accuracy significantly. Quantitative understanding of the uncertainty of the Beamfilling Correction Factor (BCF) is very important for the understanding of the accuracy of microwave passive rainfall retrieval. Refinement of the calculation of the BCF and the estimation of BCF uncertainty are the main purposes of this thesis. &#xd;
The characteristic of rainfall distribution is investigated. Quantitative understanding of the statistical characteristics of rainfall distribution provides an indication of the beamfilling error and the uncertainty of BCF in many ways.&#xd;
Some refinements to the traditional BCF calculation algorithm are provided in this thesis. Scattering is included in the new algorithm. Also the BCF calculation only considers the cases within the useful dynamic range. These refinements make the BCF calculation closer to how it is used in the retrieval algorithm. The BCF based on the new algorithm should be more accurate. &#xd;
The global BCF uncertainty and the local BCF uncertainty are estimated using the available A/C radar data. The results show that the uncertainty of BCF is much smaller than expected, and also show that the BCF derived from a specific set of data can be used globally.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Foraging theory suggests that hungry animals balance a complex set of costs and benefits when determining what and how to eat.  Prey distribution, patch size, and the presence of conspecifics are important factors influencing a predator's feeding tactics, including the decision to feed individually or socially.  Dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) in New Zealand employ different feeding tactics in varying habitats and seasons. I used programmed survey routes and opportunistic sightings to examine the habitat use and feeding mechanics of dusky dolphins in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand, a protected shallow-water environment frequented by wintering dolphins.  I encountered 253 dolphin groups, of which 58.5% were engaged in food-acquisition activities.  Photographic efforts revealed a total of 177 individually-recognizable dolphins, 100 of which were returnees from previous seasons.  Thirty-seven feeding groups and 70 bouts of feeding behavior were followed. Two-minute interval sampling as well as active acoustic sonar were used to test the hypothesis that diurnally-feeding dolphins would work in a coordinated manner to bring schooling fish to the surface.  Feeding tactics observed in Admiralty Bay were then compared to foraging by some of the same animals in the unprotected, deep-water environment off Kaikoura, where large numbers of dusky dolphins feed during the night on organisms associated with a vertically-migrating scattering layer.  Evidence supporting coordinated surface feeding was not statistically significant, but indicative of behavioral flexibility in feeding styles as part of a larger feeding repertoire. A potential shift in prey distribution from previous years may also explain some observed patterns. Feeding groups were positively correlated with seabirds and New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri). Mean group size of &#xd;
6.1 (± 8.23 S.D., n=253) in Admiralty Bay is dramatically less than groups observed off Kaikoura, a variation likely reflecting differences in prey number and distribution, as well as differences in predation risk by deep-water sharks and killer whales.  Behavioral flexibility likely confers an adaptive advantage for species subject to environmental fluctuation, whether due to natural or anthropogenic sources.  Further research is necessary to evaluate prey distribution in Admiralty Bay and its possible effects on feeding dusky dolphins.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Tetrahydrobiopterin</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Diabetes</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Diabetic rats exhibit decrease in plasma arginine, NO synthesis and tetrahydrobiopterin in endothelial cells (EC). Treatment with L-arginine may be beneficial for enhancing NO synthesis in diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, little is known about the mechanism responsible for the stimulatory effect of arginine on endothelial NO synthesis. We hypothesized that dietary arginine supplementation increases BH4 for NO synthesis in EC of diabetic rats, thereby preventing endothelial dysfunction. In experiment I, streptozotocin (STZ) induced-diabetic male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (a model of type-I diabetes) were individually pair-fed a casein-based diet on the basis of feed intake (per kg body weight) of non-diabetic SD rats. Addition of arginine-HCl or alanine to drinking water for the rats were adjusted daily to ensure isonitrogenous provision per kg body weight. In non-diabetic rats, arginine supplementation increased plasma arginine (144%), plasma insulin (44%), EC arginine (88%), EC BH4 (106%) and EC NO synthesis (80%), compared with alanine treatment. In diabetic rats, arginine supplementation reduced body weight loss (36%), and plasma glucose (54%), and increased plasma arginine (110%), plasma insulin (209%), EC arginine (173%), EC BH4 (128%) and EC NO synthesis (125%), compared with alanine treatment.  In experiment II, male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (a model of type-II diabetes) were individually pair-fed a Purina 5008 diet on the basis of feed intake by alanine-treated diabetic rats (per kg body wt). Addition of arginine-HCl or alanine to drinking water for the rats was adjusted daily to ensure isonitrogenous provision per kg body weight. Arginine supplementation to ZDF rats did not affect plasma glucose and insulin, reduced epidididmal fat (30%), abdominal fat (43%) and body weight gain (18%), and increased plasma arginine (273%), EC arginine (197%), EC BH4 (120%) and EC NO synthesis (122%), compared with alanine-treated ZDF rats. These results show that dietary L-arginine supplementation increases BH4 and NO synthesis in EC of both STZ-diabetic and ZDF rats. Strikingly, arginine treatment prevented hyperglycemia in STZ-diabetic SD rats and reduced obesity in ZDF rats. Collectively, results demonstrate that oral administration of arginine is beneficial for both type-I and type-II diabetic rats.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation explores beta dose profile of microspheres packed in arteries, various source geometries of 142Pr that can be used for therapeutic purpose, and dose backscatter factors for selected beta sources. &#xd;
A novel treatment method by injecting microspheres into feeding arteries of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is under pre-clinical investigation. To optimize radiation dose to the clinically important area, i.e. arterial wall, preliminary dosimetric studies were needed. Monte Carlo calculations were performed for several geometries simulating arteries filled with microspheres packed by random packing methods. Arterial radii used in the simulation varied from 50 mm to 3 mm; microsphere radii varied from 10 mm to 0.7 mm. Dose varied significantly as a function of microsphere size, for constant arterial sizes. For the same sizes of arteries, significant dose increase was observed because of inter-artery exposure for large arteries (> 0.1 cm rad.) filled with large microspheres (> 0.03 cm rad.). Dose increase between small arteries (0.03 cm rad.) was less significant.&#xd;
The dose profiles of prototype 142Pr beta brachytherapy sources were calculated using MCNP 4C Monte Carlo code as well as dose point kernel (DPK) for selected cases.  Dose profiles were similar to beta sources currently used indicating that 142Pr can substitute for current sources for certain cases and the DPK was closely matched with MCNP result.&#xd;
Backscattering of electrons is a prominent secondary effect in beta dosimetry.  The backscattering is closely correlated with factors such as geometry of source and scattering material, and composition of scattering material.  The backscattering factors were calculated for selected beta sources that are currently used as well as potentially useful sources for therapeutic purpose. The factors were calculated as a function of distance from the interface between water and scatterers. These factors were fit by a simple function for future incorporation into a DPK code. Backscattering effect was significant for short distance from the surface of interface between water and scattering material.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The goal of this inductive study was to identify factors that facilitate and inhibit binational collaboration in the recovery of endangered species in the northern Mexico borderlands, focusing on the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi). A conceptual model was developed using qualitative techniques, providing the basis for design of a mail survey. The target population included participants with experience in recovery efforts for over a dozen species at risk in the region. Long interviews were recorded with 44 participants from Mexico and the United States. Thematic hierarchical analysis was used to develop a conceptual model of how interviewees talked about factors influencing binational collaboration.  Issues were classified in five thematic clusters:  project, organization, people, resources, culture/history.   The survey was used to conduct a needs assessment, measuring respondents' attitudes about the relative priority of issues identified in the conceptual model.  High priority needs were identified from each thematic cluster: (a) equitable participation in project design and implementation, (b) continuity of personnel, (c) coordination of federal, state and local efforts, (d) increased funding, managed with accountability, and (e) exchange visits to facilitate understanding of diverse perspectives.  Responses to almost half the survey items indicated accord among the sample of respondents, providing a basis for shared common ground.  The nature of discord was within the range of "manageable", with no clear polarization of attitudes measured.   This exploratory data analysis suggested that the structure of the conceptual model developed from the Mexican wolf case study was generally a valid basis for future deductive analysis and reflection by practitioners.   For 82% of 22 statements of need, priorities of participants in the Mexican wolf recovery efforts did not differ significantly from other respondents.  Nationality (of respondents) significantly affected priority rankings for only 18% of the need statements.  Significant effects of five demographic variables indicated that interactive effects should be examined in future multivariate analyses to determine how respondents' attitudes on issues related to priority rankings. Recommendations were provided for a more efficient and effective approach to collaborative problem-solving, engaging reflective practitioners from the private and public sectors in principled negotiation processes to better understand diverse perspectives.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Oxygen consumption</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Nineteen bovine muscles were removed from beef carcasses (n = 9).  Muscles were trimmed free of fat, cut into 2.54 cm thick steaks, and were packaged in Styrofoam trays with polyvinylchloride overwrap.  Steaks were assigned randomly to a day of retail display (0-, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-d).  Steaks were evaluated over the course of retail display for objective measures of discoloration (metmyoglobin, oxymyoglobin, L*-, a*-, and b*-values), reducing ability (metmyoglobin reductase activity, resistance to induced metmyoglobin formation, and nitric oxide metmyoglobin reducing ability), oxygen consumption rate, oxygen penetration depth, myoglobin content, oxidative rancidity, and pH. Muscles were grouped according to objective color measures of discoloration.  M. longissimus lumborum, M. longissimus thoracis, M. semitendinosus, and M. tensor fasciae latae were grouped as "high" color stability muscles, M. semimembranosus, M. rectus femoris, and M. vastus lateralis were grouped as "moderate" color stability &#xd;
muscles, M. trapezius, M. gluteus medius, and M. latissimus dorsi were grouped as "intermediate" color stability muscles, M. triceps brachi - long head, M. biceps femoris, &#xd;
M. pectoralis profundus, M. adductor, M. triceps brachi - lateral head, and M. serratus ventralis were grouped as "low" color stability muscles, and M. supraspinatus, M. infraspinatus, and M. psoas major were grouped as "very low" color stability muscles. Generally, muscles of high color stability had high resistance to induced metmyoglobin formation, nitric oxide reducing ability, and oxygen penetration depth and possessed low oxygen consumption rates, myoglobin content, and oxidative rancidity.  In contrast, muscles of low color stability had high metmyoglobin reductase activity, oxygen consumption rates, myoglobin content, and oxidative rancidity and low resistance to induced metmyoglobin formation, nitric oxide metmyoglobin reducing ability, and oxygen penetration depth. Data indicate that discoloration differences between muscles are related to the amount of reducing activity relative to the oxygen consumption rate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Color stability and cooked muscle color were evaluated in relation to myoglobin content, oxygen consumption rate, pH, lipid oxidation, oxygen penetration depth, metmyoglobin reductase activity, Hunter L*- a*- b*- values, discoloration, and degree of doneness for the M. Infraspinatus (IF), M. Triceps brachii (TB), M. Teres major (TM), M. Rectus femoris (RF), M. Vastus lateralis (VL), M. Semimembranosus (SM), &#xd;
M. Biceps femoris (BF), M. Semitendinosus (ST), M. Gluteus medius (GM), as well as the M. Psoas major (PM), and M. Longissimus lumborum (LL). Steaks from these muscles were segmented into a low oxygen dark, low oxygen light, high oxygen, and PVC overwrap packaging environment for six days of retail display.  There were no major differences in pH, oxygen consumption rate, or myoglobin reductase acitivity between shelf-life days and packaging environments for the muscles used in the study.  The VL, TB, ST, SM, and the GM had higher levels of lipid oxidation in the later days of shelf-life storage and were higher (P &lt; 0.05) in high oxygen packaging compared to the other three treatments.  Oxygen penetration depth was greater (P &lt; 0.05) over all storage days for the high oxygen treatment in the TB and LL as compared to the other treatments.  Hunter CIE a* and b* values significantly decreased across all muscles for the high oxygen and PVC treatments.  Discoloration increased significantly as storage days increased in the high oxygen and PVC treatments for the TB, SM, VL, BF, IF, GM, PM, and TM. Degree of doneness was higher (P &lt; 0.05) for the PM, TB, and SM muscles in a high oxygen atmosphere as compared to the low oxygen light and low oxygen dark treatments.  Aerobic reducing ability tended to decrease as retail shelf-life day increased. A high oxygen environment increased rancidity, oxygen penetration depth, redness values, and degree of doneness (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to a low oxygen light and low oxygen dark modified atmosphere package.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The HPr proteins were characterized as folding by a two-state folding mechanism. Here, we present a comparison of the equilibrium and kinetic folding for the HPr protein from Bacillus subtilis, E coli and a key variant from these proteins. For the wild-type protein we find that GHX is greater than GUDC, suggesting that the HPr does not fold by a simple two-state mechanism. This discrepancy is revealed by testing the two-state nature of the folding reaction of HPr with mutation. We show that removing a single charge side chain (Asp 69) converts the HPr protein back to a simple two-state mechanism.&#xd;
Ribonuclease Sa and two charge-reversal variants can be converted into amyloidin vitro by the addition of 2,2,2-triflouroethanol (TFE). We report here amyloid fibril formation for these proteins as a function of pH. The pH at maximal fibril formation correlates with the pH dependence of protein solubility, but not with stability, for these variants. Additionally, we show that the pH at maximal fibril formation for a number of ivwell-characterized proteins is near the pI, where the protein is expected to be the least soluble. This suggests that protein solubility is an important determinant of fibril formation.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Flash Evaporation</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Pulsed Laser Deposition</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Bismuth-Strontium-Calcium-Copper-Oxide (BSCCO) compounds are an important family of compounds that have one of the highest transition temperatures among all high-temperature superconductors. The compound is known to exist in three distinct phases, commonly referred to as the 2201, 2212 and 2223 phases. Of these three phases, the 2212 and 2223 phases are the most important, as their transition temperature is higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. It is desirable to produce the compound in thin film form, as the bulk samples are normally polycrystalline. &#xd;
This thesis compares thin films produced by two techniques for depositing BSCCO in order to understand the effect of various processing parameters on the final quality of the thin films. Thin films were grown by flash evaporation at Texas A&amp;M University, and by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at the University of Wollongong, Australia. The latter of these techniques is widely used for growing thin films of various compounds. Single-phase 2212 films were grown on a MgO substrate using the pulsed laser deposition technique from commercially available 2212 powder. The effect of annealing on the thin films was also studied.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Bretton Woods</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>European Monetary System</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The United States acted unilaterally to terminate the Bretton Woods monetary system in August 1971, and international exchange rate management went from a regime of fixed to floating parities, much to the displeasure of the membership of the European Community.  The Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations adopted policies that heavily benefited U.S. reform objectives and domestic economic goals, which frequently clashed with allied concerns, and damaged American monetary relations with France and West Germany.  Yet, the inability of France and the Federal Republic of Germany to form cohesive economic and monetary policies throughout international negotiations or within the European Community (EC), allowed American desires to dictate the path and pace of European integration.  &#xd;
France and Germany attempted, with limited success, to influence U.S. monetary policy through bilateral diplomacy during years of exchange rate fluctuations, dollar devaluations, oil shocks, and payments deficits.  Finally, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt created the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1979, reversing the trend of half-hearted attempts at European integration so relevant the decade before.  The EMS detached the EC's currencies from the dollar's control, was compatible with the reformed international monetary system, advanced a more independent European monetary identity, and formed the base for future monetary integration.  As a result, the EMS, as the birthplace of the Euro, the single European currency launched in 2002, may soon rival the dollar's position as the primary reserve currency.  &#xd;
American monetary policies designed to improve the health of the dollar during the 1970s were a catalyst for European integration.  However, as the European Union deepens its economic integration and the Euro grows in strength, it seems that U.S. policies created a regime and a currency that will challenge its dominant position in international monetary affairs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Emerging technologies such as Bluetooth and 802.11b (Wi-Fi) have fuelled the growth of the short-range communication industry. Bluetooth, the leading WPAN (wireless personal area network) technology, was designed primarily for cable replacement applications. The first generation Bluetooth products are focused on providing low-cost radio connections among personal electronic devices. In the WLAN (wireless local area network) arena, Wi-Fi appears to be the superior product. Wi-Fi is designed for high speed internet access, with higher radio power and longer distances. Both technologies use the same 2.4GHz ISM band. The differences between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standard features lead to a natural partitioning of applications. Nowadays, many electronics devices such as laptops and PDAs, support both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards to cover a wider range of applications. The cost of supporting both standards, however, is a major concern. Therefore, a dual-mode transceiver is essential to keep the size and cost of such system transceivers at a minimum.&#xd;
A fully integrated low-IF Bluetooth receiver is designed and implemented in a low cost, main stream 0.35um CMOS technology. The system includes the RF front end, frequency synthesizer and baseband blocks. It has -82dBm sensitivity and draws 65mA current. This project involved 6 Ph.D. students and I was in charge of the design of the channel selection complex filter is designed. &#xd;
In the Bluetooth transmitter, a frequency modulator with fine frequency steps is needed to generate the GFSK signal that has +/-160kHz frequency deviation. A low power ROM-less direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS) is designed to implement the frequency modulation. The DDFS can be used for any frequency or phase modulation communication systems that require fast frequency switching with fine frequency steps. &#xd;
Another contribution is the implementation of a dual-mode 802.11b/Bluetooth receiver in IBM 0.25um BiCMOS process. Direct-conversion architecture was used for both standards to achieve maximum level of integration and block sharing. I was honored to lead the efforts of 7 Ph.D. students in this project. I was responsible for system level design as well as the design of the variable gain amplifier. The receiver chip consumes 45.6/41.3mA and the sensitivity is -86/-91dBm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The construction industry in recent times is seen to be highly competitive and dynamic. To remain progressive in such an environment construction companies need to be aggressive in terms of getting business. This is where the importance of marketing and business development comes into play. This thesis addresses the different business development strategies used by general contracting construction companies in Texas for market diversification. Initially, a framework is established for this study through the presentation of brief history and marketing theories. Then, through literature review, four common business development strategies are identified, which are in turn later used to compare the data collected from the industry. Data are collected via surveys of general contractors in Texas. Results show that companies which satisfied majority of the four characteristics identified previously showed better growth. Further conclusions are discussed and future recommendations are also presented.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Business-to-business (B2B) electronic marketplaces (e-marketplaces) are one of the most heralded developments in recent years.  These marketplaces bring together businesses buying and selling goods and services in an online buying community. E-marketplaces promise to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of procurement activities by replacing traditional manual processes with automated electronic procedures and by expanding the number of available trading partners.   Despite the technology availability and the high potential benefits, very few e-marketplaces have succeeded.  This three-year study identifies and investigates two major B2B e-marketplace stumbling blocks:  attracting a sufficient number of members, and then influencing these members to use the e-marketplace. &#xd;
This investigation uses a variety of qualitative techniques to solicit information from nearly fifty executives representing four B2B e-marketplaces with contrasting membership and use levels.  Within each e-marketplace, the study solicited information from high and low use organizations, buying and selling organizations, and a nonparticipant organization.  The interview data was analyzed using line-by-line analysis from grounded theory.  The analysis involved assimilating the unique stories of each manager into drivers that affect e-marketplace membership or use. These drivers were then compared to membership levels and/or use levels. &#xd;
The analysis resulted in three research models.  Each research model is a data-driven representation of factors driving B2B e-marketplace membership, B2B e-marketplace use, and a particular organization's B2B e-marketplace use.  Each model contains several unique drivers and offers a comprehensive picture of what is happening in e-marketplaces. &#xd;
These findings enhance management's understanding of e-marketplaces, their role in business, their challenges, and ways of overcoming these challenges in order to reap the benefits of e-marketplace participation.  This study brings one of the first grounded theory investigations of B2B e-marketplace membership and use to the limited academic research in this area.  This research offers insights to a number of theories, including transaction cost economics, institutional theory, resource dependency theory, and public goods theory.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis presents the development of calibration and data-reduction algorithms for non-conventional multi-hole pressure probes. The algorithms that have been developed for conventional 5- and 7-hole probes are not optimal for probes with port arrangements (on the probe tip) that are non-conventional. Conventional algorithms utilize the axisymmetry of the port distribution pattern to define the non-dimensional pressure coefficients. These coefficients are typically defined specifically for these patterns, but fail to correctly represent different patterns of port arrangements, such as patterns without axisymmetry or regularity. The algorithms introduced herein can handle any pattern of port arrangement, from axisymmetric and regular to random. Moreover, they eliminate the need to separate the measurement domain of a probe to "low-angle" and "high-angle" regimes, typical in conventional 5- and 7-hole-probe algorithms that require two different sets of pressure coefficient definitions and procedures. Additionally, the algorithms have been formulated such that they facilitate redundancy implementations, especially in applications where such redundancy is important, such as air-data systems.  The developed algorithms are first applied to a non-conventional probe, a nearly omni-directional 18-hole probe, and demonstrate very high flow measurement accuracy. Subsequently, the algorithms were applied to a new 12-hole, nearly omni-directional, flow velocity measurement probe capable of measuring reversed flows. The new 12-hole design offers several advantages over a previously developed, 18-hole, nearly omni-directional probe. The probe is optimized in the sense that, regardless of the flow direction, it allows calculation of the 4 unknown flow quantities, i.e. the two flow angles, the velocity magnitude and the static pressure, with the minimum necessary number of holes/ports on the probe tip. This probe also has a non-conventional arrangement of its pressure ports and therefore the new calibration and data-reduction algorithms can be effectively employed. With theoretically generated pressure data for the 12-hole probe, the coefficient definitions are analyzed and found to be well-behaved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Continuous Phase Modulation is a popular digital modulation scheme for systems which have tight spectral efficiency and Peak-to-Average ratio (PAR) constraints. In this thesis we propose a method of estimating the capacity for a Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM) system and also describe techniques for design of codes for this system. We note that the CPM modulator can be decomposed into a trellis code followed by a memoryless modulator. This decomposition enables us to  perform iterative demodulation  of the signal and improve the performance of the system. Thus we have the option of either performing iterative demodulation, where the channel decoder and the demodulator are invoked in an iterative fashion, or a non-iterative demodulation, where the demodulation is performed only once followed by the decoding of the message. &#xd;
&#xd;
We highlight the recent results in the estimation of capacity for channels with memory and apply it to a CPM system. We estimate two different types of capacity of the CPM system over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The first capacity assumes that optimum demodulation and decoding is done, and the second one assumes that the demodulation is done only once. Having obtained the capacity of the system we try to approach this capacity by designing outer codes matched to the CPM system. We utilized LDPC codes, since they can be designed to perform very close to capacity limit of the system. The design complexity for LDPC codes can be reduced by assuming that the input to the decoder is Gaussian distributed. We explore three different ways of approximating the CPM demodulator output to a Gaussian distribution and use it to design LDPC codes for a Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) system. Finally we describe the design of Multi Level Codes (MLC) for CPM systems using the capacity matching rule.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>debt maturity</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>capital inflows</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>sudden stops</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This dissertation attempts in three essays to contribute to the growing body of research on the problems associated with sudden stops of capital inflows, known to have been at the heart of many recent emerging market crises.  It does this by developing basic models that can incorporate sudden stops and hopefully make policy relevant recommendations.&#xd;
The first essay develops a simple three date representative agent model of a small open endowment economy without money.  It allows sudden stops to occur at date two and asks whether individuals in such a shock-prone world are still better off borrowing than in autarky. Unambiguously, this chapter shows that individuals are better off borrowing than in autarky and provides a tractable core model on which the later chapters build.&#xd;
	The second essay then includes a long-term borrowing option as well as country-specific risk premia based on an information asymmetry between domestic borrowers and international lenders.  This allows analysis of optimal maturity choices in a meaningful way.  The intent is to address questions in the literature concerning whether emerging economies could enhance welfare by imposing short-term capital controls to encourage the use of longer-maturing debt and thus avoid the sudden stop.  The results imply that short-term capital controls would generally lower welfare, even when sudden stops are fully anticipated.&#xd;
	Finally, the third essay extends the horizon of the model and includes a much wider range of maturities.  This allows one to start making sense of maturity bunching (when a country's debt all matures around a given date) which is known to exacerbate sudden-stop related problems.  The model shows that maturity bunching can occur endogenously when both risk premia and uncertainty over the duration of the sudden stop are present.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The focus of this research is characterizing a new material system composed of carbon and graphite foams, which has potential in a wide variety of applications encompassing aerospace, military, offshore, power production and other commercial industries.  The benefits of this new material include low cost, light weight, fire-resistance, good energy absorption, and thermal insulation or conduction as desired. The objective of this research is to explore the bulk material properties and failure modes of the carbon foam through experimental and computational analysis in order to provide a better understanding and assessment of the material for successful design in future applications. Experiments are conducted according to ASTM standards to determine the mechanical properties and failure modes of the carbon foam.  Sandwich beams composed of open cell carbon foam cores and carbon-epoxy laminate face sheets are tested in the flexure condition using a four point setup.  The primary failure mode is shear cracks developing in the carbon foam core at a critical axial strain value of 2,262 με. In addition to flexure, the carbon foam is loaded under tensile and shear loads to determine the respective material moduli. Computational analysis is undertaken to further investigate the carbon foam's failure modes and material characteristics in the sandwich beam configuration.  Initial estimates are found using classical laminated plate theory and a linear finite element model.  Poor results were obtained due to violation of assumptions used in both cases.  Thus, an additional computational analysis incorporating three dimensional strain-displacement relationships into the finite element analysis is used.  Also, a failure behavior pattern for the carbon foam core is included to simulate the unique failure progression of the carbon foam on a microstructure level.  Results indicate that displacements, strains and stresses from the flexure experiments are closely predicted by this two parameter progressive damage model.  The final computational model consisted of a bond line (interface) study to determine the source of the damage initiation, and it is concluded that damage initiates in the carbon foam, not at the bond line.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>characterization</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A methodology for ligament isolation and specimen preparation for tensile testing of single ligaments from the unit cell of open-cell carbon foams has been successfully developed and implemented. Results are presented for ligaments of three different carbon foam designations. Two of them are reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foams of 20 and 45 pores-per- inch (ppi) coated with SiC by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and the other is a RVC 20 ppi foam without coating.&#xd;
&#xd;
Scanning electron microscopy and digital imaging analysis is used to analyze the fracture surfaces posts tests. The ultimate strength of each ligament evaluated. Weibull statistics is used to describe the strength distribution of ligaments. While the distribution of strengths of the carbon foam ligaments (RVC) could be described with a one-population distribution, it is found that a two-population Weibull distribution is necessary to describe the distribution of strength of the SiC coated ligaments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation comprises the investigation of two subjects in the field of dimetal paddlewheel-type compounds containing metal-metal bonds: unsolvated transition metal carboxylates and triply bonded divanadium compounds. The first subject is very mature; dichromium tetraacetate was first synthesized in 1844, and hundreds of dimetal tetracarboxylates have been structurally characterized to date. A general  question concerning the complexes of the type M2L4-Xn (where n = 0 to 2) is the extent to which the M-M distances are influenced by the presence of axial ligands, X. However, virtually none of the carboxylato complexes crystallize without axial ligands. In the solid state, in the absence of a coordinating solvent, the dimetal units often act as axial ligands to one another. In order to exclude axial coordination, both from donor solvent molecules, and from the aggregation of M24+ units, we have successfully used the bulky 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzoate ligand to bridge the dimetal core. We have investigated the triisopropylbenzoato complexes of some metals which are known for their ability to form a vast array of tetracarboxylato complexes, namely chromium, copper, molybdenum, and rhodium, and have found that these novel compounds display some interesting structural and chemical properties.&#xd;
The second subject of this dissertation is much more contemporary. Although compounds containing multiple bonds between metal atoms have been known since 1964, the first triply-bonded divanadium compound was not synthesized until 1992, and only two additional compounds of this type have been made in the intervening ten years. In order to extend this chemistry, several additional compounds containing a triply bonded V24+ core have recently been characterized. In our study of these compounds, we have discovered the first example of a stable paddlewheel-type compound with a M23+ core.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research explored the causal relationships among strategies, corporate structure, and performance of the largest U.S. non-financial firms using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Corporate strategies and structure have been analyzed as major variables to influence corporate performance in management and organizational studies. However, their causal relationships in terms of which variables are leaders and followers, as well as the choices of variables to configure them, are controversial. Finding of causal relationships among strategic variables, structural variables, and corporate performance is beneficial to researchers as well as corporate mangers. It provides guidance to researchers how to build a model in order to measure influences from one variable to the other, lowering the risk of drawing spurious conclusions. It also provides managers a prospect of how certain important variables would change by making a certain strategic decision. Literatures from agency theory, transactional cost economics, and traditional strategic management perspective are used to suggest variables essential to analyze corporate performance. This study includes size and multi-organizational ownership hierarchy as variables to configure corporate structure. The variables to configure corporate strategies are unrelated and related diversification, ownership by institutional investors, debt, investment in R&amp;D, and investment in advertisement.&#xd;
The study finds that most of the variables classified as corporate strategy and corporate structure variables are either direct or indirect causes of corporate accounting performance. Generally, results supports the relational model: corporate structure® corporate strategy® corporate performance. Ownership hierarchy structure, unrelated diversification, advertising expenses, and R&amp;D intensity have direct causal influences on corporate accounting performance. Size and related diversification affected corporate accounting performance indirectly, both through ownership hierarchy structure. Theoretical causal relationships from agency theory are less supported than those from transaction cost economics and traditional strategic management perspective. Further my study suggests that, in general, good corporate performance in 1990s was mainly achieved by internal expansion through investment in R&amp;D and advertisement, rather than external expansion of firms through unrelated diversification, related diversification, and expansion of ownership hierarchy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>One of the most important issues in the study of Urban-Service Distribution is the choice of the unit of analysis.  Because of the ready availability of various data at the level of residence units, census tracts have been the spatial units most commonly selected.  In some cases, municipally defined service districts have also been selected, and they are, in fact, only the aggregates of several neighboring census tracts.  The problem encountered in the current study is the fact that Census-based Neighborhoods such as census tracts and the aggregations of census tracts frequently do not correspond with commonly recognized neighborhoods experienced informally in daily life, and they do not match local residents' perceptions of their neighborhoods as social areas.  &#xd;
The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Resident-perceived Neighborhood Boundaries (as the alternative unit of analysis to conventionally-used Census-based Neighborhood Units) on the accessibility to public parks based on equity consideration and its relationship to park utilization.  The study also addressed whether the neighborhood boundaries perceived by the actual residents may exhibit more actual neighborhood construct than Census-based Neighborhood Units when the relationship between park accessibility and utilization is considered.&#xd;
First, the results indicate that when Resident-perceived Neighborhood Boundaries are adopted, there is no significant change, either in accessibility measures or in the equity of public park distribution among neighborhoods of different social strata.  &#xd;
Second, there was no significant relationship between parks accessibility and utilization, which means that even though a park may be closest to a household, it is not always true that the household will choose to use that park. &#xd;
Third, it was confirmed that the relationship between park accessibility and utilization was significantly affected by some utilization factors.  That is, travel distances to the parks were significantly affected by different types of utilization factors and, according to the classification of park type, the affecting utilization factors were different.&#xd;
Lastly, as the spatial unit of analysis, Resident-perceived Neighborhood Boundaries do not significantly enhance the strength of the relationship between public services accessibility and utilization compared to using Census-based Neighborhood Units.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>myokinin</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Myokinins are invertebrate neuropeptides with myotropic and diuretic activity. The lymnokinin receptor from the snail Lymnaea stagnalis was the only previously identified myokinin receptor.  A cDNA encoding a neuropeptide receptor was cloned from the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. The deduced amino acid sequence was 40 % identical to the lymnokinin receptor.  The receptor transcript is present in all tick life stages as determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR.  When expressed in mammalian CHO-K1 cells, myokinins at nanomolar concentrations induced increases in intracellular calcium as measured by fluorescent cytometry.  The rank order of potency for peptides tested was FFFSWS-NH2≥FFFSWG-NH2≥FFSWG-NH2>FYSWG-NH2>muscakinin>lymnokinin>>APTGFFGVR-NH2.  The receptor coupled to a pertussis toxin insensitive G protein.  Absence of extracellular calcium did not inhibit the calcium response, indicating the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.  Receptor transcript was detected by RT-PCR in the dissected synganglia, ovaries, salivary glands, guts and Malpighian tubules of partially engorged adult female ticks.  It is concluded that the B. microplus receptor is the first myokinin receptor cloned from an arthropod, and the first neuropeptide receptor known from the Acari.  The presence of this receptor transcript in multiple tissues and all life stages suggests a multifunctional role in ticks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete structures results in significant repair and rehabilitation costs. In the past several years, new fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcing bars have been introduced as an alternative to steel reinforcing bars. Several national and international organizations have recently developed standards based on preliminary test results. However, limited validation testing has been performed on the recommendations of these standards. High variability of the tensile properties, degradation of tensile strength, direct shear capacity, predicted deflections due to creep, cracking behavior of FRP-reinforced concrete flexural members, bond behavior and development length, and effects of thermal expansion on cracking of FRP reinforced concrete have all been reported, but are areas that need further investigation and validation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of glass FRP reinforcing bars and provide recommendations on the design and construction of concrete structures containing these bar types with regard to the areas described. The recently developed ACI 440 design guidelines were analyzed and modifications proposed.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Rodessa Formation</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Reservoir characterization</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The Rodessa Formation is one of the major oil and gas reservoirs in the East Texas Basin. In Van Field, the upper Rodessa Formation consists of interbedded biotic and abiotic mudstones to grainstones. The lower Rodessa is composed of interbedded sandstones, shales, and limestones called the Carlisle Member. Based on core and well log interpretation, the Rodessa Formation was deposited on a broad, restricted, shallow marine platform interpreted to be lagoonal, subtidal, and intertidal. &#xd;
	Both Rodessa limestone and sandstone have been altered significantly by diagenetic processes that include micritization, cementation, dissolution, neomorphism and compaction. Dissolution is the main factor that resulted in enhanced porosity and permeability while cementation adversely affected porosity. Diagenesis is interpreted to have begun in the marine phreatic environment and continued through the freshwater phreatic and shallow burial environments.&#xd;
	Two reservoir units have been identified from core and well log interpretations. The potential reservoir within the Rodessa Formation occurs in the Carlisle Member which is composed mainly of medium to coarse grained sandstone with porosities and permeabilities in ranges of 8 to 11 percent and 46 to 896 millidarcies, respectively. The water saturation analysis has also shown the reservoir to be hydrocarbon bearing, having water saturation below 46 percent.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>biotypes</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Greenbug is one of two key insect pests of sorghum, and biotype evolution hinders the long-term usefulness of resistant sorghums.  The current study sought to identify plant resistance mechanisms, plant damage characteristics, and greenbug fitness in sorghum/greenbug interactions.  Choice tests were conducted to elucidate resistance mechanisms displayed by four sorghum genotypes towards several greenbug biotypes and isolates.  Results indicated all three resistance modalities (antibiosis, antixenosis, tolerance) were identified in sorghums, with some genotypes displaying two or more modalities towards some biotypes.  This suggests some sorghum genotypes do not select for greenbug biotypes, and the sorghum genotypes cultivated may have relatively long-term resistance. Non-choice tests were used to determine plant damage associated with greenbug feeding.  Four sorghum genotype, Johnson grass, and five greenbug biotype combinations were used to elucidate plant characteristics associated with visible plant damage.  Fluid loss and plant stunting were significantly associated with visible plant damage, and were also observed in some plants not incurring heavy visible damage.  Additionally, some biotypes avirulent to cultivated sorghum caused significant damage to Johnson grass.  These results suggest visible plant damage, routinely used in damage studies, reflects underlying causes that could lead to poor agronomic performance.  Additionally, Johnson grass may harbor greenbug biotypes not commonly found in sorghum fields. Greenbug colony and individual fitness were determined by reproduction rates of five biotypes on four sorghum genotypes and Johnson grass in non-choice tests.  Generally, colony and individual fitness estimates were not different within genotype/biotype combinations.  Also, biotypes did best on more susceptible and worst on more resistant sorghum genotypes.  Colonies and individuals of all biotypes had lowest fitness on Johnson grass.  These results suggest virulent biotypes may have a fitness advantage over avirulent ones, at least in the presence of the cultivated host. The results presented herein reflect the diversity of sorghum/greenbug interactions, and underscore the need for further understanding of the nature of greenbug biotypes, and how they interact with cultivated and non-cultivated host plants.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>mycotoxin</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>trichothecene</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>regulation</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The trichothecene mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by a variety of fungal genera including Fusarium, Myrothecium, Trichothecium, and Stachybotyris, that are toxic to humans and animals that ingest them by consumption of contaminated grain.  This work details the characterization of a novel regulatory gene from Fusarium sporotrichioides, Tri10, which is located in the trichothecene gene cluster.  Northern analysis of Tri10 deletion strains, Tri10 overexpressing strains, and a Tri6 deletion strain indicated that Tri10 is required for wild-type trichothecene gene expression and for wild-type expression of a primary metabolic gene, Fpps.  Analysis of these mutants also provided evidence for a regulatory feedback loop where Tri10 is required for the expression of Tri6 and Tri6 negatively regulates Tri10.  Furthermore, under certain growth conditions the sensitivity of ΔTri10 and ΔTri6 strains to T-2 toxin was increased.  Analysis of mutants altered in the expression and genomic position of Tri10 revealed that placing Tri10 under the control of an exogenous promoter resulted in the overexpression of Tri10 and the other Tri genes whether this construct was located inside or outside of the Tri gene cluster.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Work outside of this study has shown that in addition to Fpps, three other primary metabolic genes from the isoprenoid pathway feeding into trichothecene biosynthesis (Acat, Mk, Hmgs) are also influenced by the expression of Tri10 and Tri6.  In the present study, targeted cDNA microarrays were used in conjunction with multiple mutants to reveal a large group of genes, containing both trichothecene and primary metabolic genes, which were positively influenced by Tri10 expression.  At the same time, a small group of genes negatively influenced by Tri10 expression was observed.  These results were in agreement with observations made outside of this study and validated the use of targeted cDNA microarrays for further studies.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Additional analysis of the regulatory network linking trichothecene secondary metabolism and isoprenoid primary metabolism revealed that in a mutant blocked in the first step of the pathway, and therefore in the absence of trichothecene production, this regulatory link is mediated by Tri10 and Tri6.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An important fraction of the reservoirs in the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico is comprised of thin-bedded deposits from channel-levee systems. These reservoirs are particularly difficult to describe. Not only is their architecture complex but the quality of the reservoir is determined by connection and length of beds below the resolution of usual reflection data. Improved characterization is needed to improve development and production of these reservoirs. This study presents an integrated approach to build a geologically consistent reservoir model, based on the 8 sand reservoir in Northern Green Canyon block 18. The underlying idea of the construction of this model is that reservoir quality is influenced more by the internal architecture than by the statistical values of petrophysical parameters. &#xd;
Seismic interpretation and attribute extraction provided the reservoir geometry and stratigraphy. The structural framework and the limits of the reservoir have been determined, showing the preeminent role of salt and faults in the constitution of this reservoir. &#xd;
Seismic attributes are calibrated to extract areal information on reservoir architecture. Gross thickness and net thickness maps have been estimated using geostatistical methods. Lateral variations in the quality of the 8 sand and the definition zones with different average properties were inferred from geostatistical results. &#xd;
Lithofacies characterization from core showed that 3 facies could be used to describe the internal variability. The fine-scale heterogeneity is described in each zone from vertical facies distribution determined from wells.&#xd;
A truncated Gaussian sequential simulation was performed to reflect both the regional trend and the internal variability on a 150*150*1 ft grid.&#xd;
The major contribution of this work is to show the efficiency of this approach to describe complex reservoirs where the impact of internal variability is a major control of flow efficiency. This is especially valuable when the well information is scarce or not uniformly distributed. This model will be used for flow simulation and sensitivity analysis to improve the field description.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) of protein digests is a widely-accepted method for protein identification in MS-based proteomic studies.  Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) is the technique of choice in PMF experiments.  The success of protein identification in a PMF experiment is directly related to the amount of amino acid sequence coverage.  In an effort to increase the amount of sequence information obtained in a MALDI PMF experiment, performic acid oxidation is performed on tryptic digests of known proteins.  Performic acid was chosen as the chemical oxidant due to the ease of use and to the selective oxidation of cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues.  In experiments performed in our laboratory, performic acid oxidation either increased or did not affect protein sequence coverage in PMF experiments when oxidized tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI.  Negative mode MALDI data were acquired, as well as positive mode MALDI data, due to the enhanced ionization of cysteic acid-containing peptides in negative mode.  Furthermore, the confidence in a protein match is increased by observation of mass shifts indicative of cysteine, methionine, and/or tryptophan in oxidized peptide ion signals when comparing MALDI spectra prior to performic acid oxidation and after oxidation due to the low abundance of these residues in the majority of all known and hypothetical proteins.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>EXIT-charts</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In this thesis we study Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) and LDPC like codes over&#xd;
non-binary fields. We extend the concepts used for non-binary LDPC codes to generalize&#xd;
Product Accumulate (PA) codes to non-binary fields. We present simulation results that&#xd;
show that PA codes over GF(4) performs considerably better than binary PA codes at&#xd;
smaller block lengths and slightly better at large block lengths. We also propose a trellis&#xd;
based decoding algorithm to decode PA codes and show that its complexity is&#xd;
considerably lower than the message-passing algorithm.&#xd;
In the second part of the thesis we study the convergence properties of non-binary PA&#xd;
codes and non-binary LDPC codes. We use EXIT-charts to study the convergence&#xd;
properties of non-binary LDPC codes with different mean column weights and show why&#xd;
certain irregularities are better. Although the convergence threshold predicted by EXIT-charts&#xd;
on non-binary LDPC codes is quite optimistic we can still use EXIT-charts for&#xd;
comparison between non-binary LDPC codes with different mean column weights.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Filter</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The growing demand of portable electronic equipment and system-on-a-chip has been pushing the industry to design circuits with very low power supply voltage and low power consumption. The Hard Disk drive industry is looking for developments in the read channel chip to push the data rates to higher speed, along with a low voltage and low cost solution. Read channel requires high-speed linear phase filters to meet these objectives. The primary objective of this project is to design, layout, and characterize a 4th-order continuous-time equiripple linear phase filter with automatic tuning system. The main requirements for design are high speed, low group delay variations, good linearity and power efficiency. &#xd;
This filter features wide cut-off frequency 500MHz, which is far beyond the current state-of-the-art. The linear phase filter is based on Gm-C biquadratics. Higher speed has been achieved by minimizing the parasitics and a complementary input stage OTA. A common mode feedback (CMFB), which ensures stability at such high frequencies, has also been designed. The inaccuracies of the filter are compensated by using a simple automatic tuning system. &#xd;
The design is fabricated in 0.35 um TSMC CMOS process technology. The design was simulated in Cadence using SPICE models provided by MOSIS for the 0.35 um TSMC process in the presence of parasitic capacitance and transistor non-idealities. Cut-off frequency of 500 MHz was achieved along with a 9% variation in the group delay.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Collection understanding shifts the traditional focus of retrieval in large collections from locating specific artifacts to gaining a comprehensive view of the collection. Visualization tools are critical to the process of efficient collection understanding. By presenting simple visual interfaces and intuitive methods of interacting with a collection, users come to understand the essence of the collection by focusing on the artifacts. This thesis discusses a practical approach for enhancing collection understanding in image collections.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Hydraulic Fractures</dc:subject>
<dc:description>It is common for field models of tight gas reservoirs to include several wells with hydraulic fractures. These hydraulic fractures can be very long, extending for more than a thousand feet. A hydraulic fracture width is usually no more than about 0.02 ft. The combination of the above factors leads to the conclusion that there is a need to model hydraulic fractures in coarse grid blocks for these field models since it may be impractical to simulate these models using fine grids.  &#xd;
In this dissertation, a method was developed to simulate a reservoir model with a single hydraulic fracture that passes through several coarse gridblocks. This method was tested and a numerical error was quantified that occurs at early time due to the use of coarse grid blocks. &#xd;
In addition, in this work, rules were developed and tested on using uniform fine grids to simulate a reservoir model with a single hydraulic fracture. Results were compared with the results from simulations using non-uniform fine grids.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>college students</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>higher education</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>assertiveness</dc:subject>
<dc:description>First-year college students have many new responsibilities and challenges.  They are faced with increasing autonomy and must find resources and people to help guide them.  Students with disabilities face an even greater need to be independent and juggle more responsibilities, as they must disclose their disabilities to campus personnel if they need accommodations and become a self-advocate.  In order to self-advocate, students must feel comfortable with being assertive. &#xd;
This study examined the differences in comfort with assertive behaviors between students with and without disabilities at three different types of postsecondary institutions (junior college, 4-year regional university, and 4-year Research 1 university).  Two hundred seventy-eight freshman and sophomore students completed a questionnaire concerning their comfort with many different assertive behaviors.  The following three variables were examined:  a) college students' comfort with overall assertiveness; b) college students' comfort with verbal assertiveness; and c) college students' comfort with prosocial verbal skills. &#xd;
iv &#xd;
There were no significant differences between students with disabilities and students without disabilities in terms of their discomfort with assertive behaviors on any of the three variables.  Males were more comfortable with assertive behaviors than females in terms of their overall assertiveness and their verbal assertiveness.  Students from the 2-year junior college were more comfortable with overall assertiveness and verbal assertiveness than students at either the 4-year regional university or the 4-year Research 1 university. There were no differences between groups in terms of their prosocial verbal skills. &#xd;
Conclusions about the differences found in the study are reported. Recommendations for disability service providers are provided, as well as suggestions for future research.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Caspian region and specifically the Apsheron peninsula of Azerbaijan is known to be polluted with a variety of environmental contaminants, making risk assessment difficult.  The wetlands of Sumgayit contain particularly complex mixtures of contaminants.  Flow cytometry and the micronucleus assay were used to assess chromosomal damage in aquatic turtles and frogs inhabiting contaminated wetlands in Azerbaijan. By evaluating biomarkers that are indicative of somatic effects, elevated chromosomal damage was documented at several sites in Azerbaijan relative to reference sites. Sediment samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorines (OCs), and mercury to evaluate contaminant associations with genetic damage. Sediment samples revealed heterogeneous patterns of PAH and mercury concentrations throughout Sumgayit.  Significant positive correlations were documented between both PAH and mercury sediment concentrations and chromosomal damage.  Population genetic methods were employed to study the effects of long-term chronic contaminant exposure in marsh frogs from Sumgayit.  The Sumgayit region has reduced levels of genetic diversity, likely due to environmental degradation.  One of the most contaminated sites in Sumgayit, WTP, appears to be a source of new mutations as a result of an increased mutation rate.  Finally, the Sumgayit region seems to act as an ecological sink, with levels of gene flow into the region exceeding gene flow out of the region. This study provides not only exposure and biomarker data, but also an integrated method for assessing the cumulative population impacts of contaminant exposure by studying both population genetic and evolutionary effects.  The results presented here will be used in conjunction with those of ongoing research involving both wildlife and humans to develop comprehensive ecological and human risk assessments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Density, species diversity, species richness, and evenness of bivalve mollusks were measured in the deep (0.2km to 3.7km) northern Gulf of Mexico to describe the community structure of benthic bivalve mollusks. Density decreased gradually from shallow continental slope depths, with remarkably high values in the Mississippi canyon, to the deepest sites. Diversity of bivalve mollusks increased from shallow continental slope depths, with low values in the Mississippi canyon, to a maximum at intermediate depths (1-2km), followed by a decrease down to the deepest locations (3.7km). Nine distinct groups were formed on the basis of the similarity in species composition. The pattern varied more abruptly on the slope compared to the deeper depths, possibly due to steeper gradients in physical variables.  ANOVA indicated that the density of bivalve mollusks was not significantly different at different depths, was not significantly different on different transects, was not significantly different between basin and non-basin, but was significantly different in canyon and non-canyon locations. Similar distinctions were observed in diversity, except that basins were lower than non-basins. The patterns observed reflect the intense elevated input of terrigenous sediments accompanied by high surface-water plankton production from the Mississippi River to the north central gulf.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Though the idea of pre-impact recovery preparedness planning has recently been promoted by federal and state governments, very little research has been done to evaluate how it affects the process of disaster recovery. This research attempts to understand how pre-impact recovery planning affects housing reconstruction by examining the relationship of pre-impact recovery planning with housing reconstruction speed and the use of mitigation techniques during housing reconstruction. This study was conducted by comparing two cases, the City of Los Angeles, California and Taichung County in Taiwan. &#xd;
This study finds that having a pre-impact preparedness recovery plan increases the speed of housing reconstruction. The relationship between having a pre-impact recovery preparedness plan and the extent to which hazard mitigation is integrated into the recovery process is not very clear, but the experience of the City of Los Angeles suggests that having a pre-impact recovery plan allows local officials to make more effective use of the “window of opportunity” after disaster.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The heritability of microfibril angle (MFA) in loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., and its genetic relationships with height, diameter, volume and specific gravity were examined in two progeny tests with known pedigrees.  Significant general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), and SCA x block effects indicated that there are both additive and non-additive genetic influences on MFA.  Individual-tree narrow-sense heritability estimates were variable, ranging from 0.17 for earlywood (ring) 4 MFA to 0.51 for earlywood (ring) 20 MFA.  Genetic correlations between MFA, specific gravity and the growth traits were non-significant due to large estimated standard errors. &#xd;
Multiple-trait selection and breeding in a mainline and elite population tree improvement program were simulated using Excel and Simetar (Richardson 2001). The effects of four selection indices were examined in the mainline population and the effects of seven selection indices and four breeding strategies were examined in the elite population.  In the mainline population, selection for increased growth caused decreased wood quality over time.  However, it was possible to maintain the overall population mean MFA and mean specific gravity at levels present in the base population by implementing restricted selection indices.  Likewise, selection for improved wood quality in the elite population resulted in decreased growth unless restricted selection indices or pulp indices derived from those of Lowe et al. (1999) were used.  Correlated phenotypic responses to selection on indices using economic weights and heritabilities were dependent on breeding strategy.  When a circular mating system (with parents randomly assigned to controlled-crosses) was used, the index trait with a higher economic weight was more influential in determining correlated responses in non-index traits than the index trait with a lower economic weight. However, when positive assortative mating was used, the index trait with a greater variance was more influential in determining correlated responses in non-index traits than the index trait with a lower variance regardless of economic weight.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Together with the advancements in animal cloning, the ability to efficiently target specific genes in somatic cells would greatly enhance several areas of research.  While it has been possible for quite some time to target specific genes in the germ cells of mice, the advancements in somatic cell gene targeting has been slowed for two main reasons.  First, the finite lifespan of somatic cells, due mainly to the inability of the somatic cells to regenerate or maintain their telomeres, poses a major problem given the lengthy selection process needed to identify a targeting event.  The second problem is the overall inefficiency of homologous recombination.  A double strand break or introduction of foreign DNA into a cell can be processed either through the homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining pathways.  Of these two, non-homologous end joining is dominant in somatic cells.  A two plasmid recombination system was used to study the effects of the manipulation of several non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination pathway molecules on the rates of homologous recombination in porcine fetal fibroblasts.  In addition, the effect of telomerase expression, cell synchrony, and DNA nuclear delivery was examined.  Results indicate a strong positive relationship between inactivation of p53, cell synchronization, and efficient DNA nuclear delivery in enhancing the rate of homologous recombination.  These findings were then applied to an actual locus in the pig, the α1,3 galactosyltransferase gene.  Results from these transfections are compared to published accounts of successful targeting at this locus and possibilities for the differences found are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A fiber amplifier is constructed at 1014.8nm and then frequency doubled to produce 507.4nm. This could then be frequency doubled again to produce 253.7 radiation. The fiber amplifier consists of Ytterbium doped double-clad fiber cooled to low temperatures and incorperates a diode laser as the seed source.  The amplifier is built in a two stage configuration with high power diode lasers at 980nm pumping each stage.  The output of the fiber amplifer is then doubled in a PPLN crystal and redoubled in a BBO cavity.  Measurements are taken throughout the system to determine ouput powers from the first stage and from the fiber amplifier as a whole.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Consumer Approval</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>GM</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Genetic modification presents the potential to advance not only agricultural production but to increase quality of life as well.  The potential this innovation presents will be irrelevant if the public is unwilling to accept and adopt it.  The following study examines public perceptions of biotechnology, specifically the consumer approval of genetically modified food products.&#xd;
This study was based on data collected from a national survey conducted in both the United States and South Korea.  The United States survey was designed to be nationally representative and consisted of 1201 respondents.  The South Korean survey was also designed to be nationally representative and consisted of 1054 respondents&#xd;
Analysis was conducted using two questions from the survey questionnaire as dependent variables: (1) approval of the use of genetic modification in the creation of plant-based food products, and (2) approval of the use of genetic modification in the creation of animal-based food products.  This study utilized probit models for binary choice and ordered probit models to analyze the likelihood of consumer approval of the use of genetic modification for the creation of food products.  &#xd;
Findings indicated that consumers in the U.S. and South Korea who possessed an accurate knowledge of the applications and outcomes of GM technology were more likely to approve of its use for the creation of foods than those who had inaccurate or no knowledge of the technology.  Additionally, the majority of consumers in the U.S. and South Korea believe that GM foods should be labeled as such.  Those consumers who felt GM labeling to be necessary were less likely to approve of the GM of foods than those who did not feel GM labeling to be necessary.  It was also found that consumers in both countries are less approving of the GM of animals than the GM of plants.&#xd;
Consumer approval of the use of genetic modification in the creation of food products can be increased with proper education that provides accurate knowledge of the applications of GM.  Labeling of GM products is likely to result in a decrease in demand, which may be offset by public educational campaigns.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The web provides a lot of fluid information but this information changes, moves, and even disappears over time. Bookmark lists, portals, and paths are collections where the building blocks are web pages, which are susceptible to these changes. A lot of research, both in industry and in academia, focuses on organizing this vast amount of data.  In this thesis, I present context-based algorithms for measuring changes to a document. The methods proposed use other documents in a collection as the context for evaluating changes in the web pages. These metrics will be used in maintaining paths as the individual pages in paths change. This approach will enhance the evaluations of change made by the currently existing Path Manager, in the Walden's Paths project that is being developed in the Center for the Study of Digital Libraries at Texas A&amp;M University.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>general theory of codes</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In 1997, Drs. G. R. Blakley and I. Borosh published two papers whose stated purpose was to present a general formulation of the notion of a code that depends only upon a code's structure and not its functionality. In doing so, they created a further generalization--the idea of a precode. Recently, Drs. Blakley, Borosh, and A. Klappenecker have worked on interpreting the&#xd;
structures and results in these pioneering papers within the framework of category theory.&#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of this dissertation is to further the above work. In particular, we seek to accomplish the following tasks within the ``general theory of codes.'&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Rewrite the original two papers in terms of the alternate representations of precodes as bipartite digraphs and Boolean matrices.&#xd;
&#xd;
2. Count various types of bipartite graphs up to isomorphism, and count various classes of codes and precodes up to isomorphism.&#xd;
&#xd;
3. Identify many of the classical objects and morphisms from category theory within the categories of codes and precodes.&#xd;
&#xd;
4. Describe the various ways of constructing a code from a precode by ``splitting' the precode.  Identify important properties of these&#xd;
constructions and their interrelationship. Discuss the properties of the constructed codes with regard to the factorization of homomorphisms through them, and discuss their relationship to the code constructed from the precode by ``smashing.'&#xd;
&#xd;
5. Define a parametrization of a precode and&#xd;
give constructions of various parametrizations of a given precode, including a ``minimal' parametrization.&#xd;
&#xd;
6. Use the computer algebra system, Maple, to represent and display a precode and its companion, opposite, smash, split, bald-split, and various parametrizations. Implement the formulae developed for counting bipartite graphs and precodes up to isomorphism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Escherichia coli has served as a model organism for studies in molecular genetics and physiology since the 1960s. Yet the function of 20% of the 4288 known and predicted proteins in E. coli is still not known.  Almost two-thirds of these proteins have homologs in other microorganisms, but their function(s) is not known in any organism. One such protein is YciG. YciG was chosen as the focus of this study because, intriguingly, an ortholog of YciG is found in the genome of the fungus Neurospora crassa. The gene encoding YciG is predicted to be in an operon with two other genes, yciF and yciE. Genes in the same operon often encode proteins with related functions, so the study was extended to include YciF and YciE. To determine the function of these proteins, in-frame deletion alleles were constructed and strains lacking one or more of the three proteins were tested for mutant phenotypes. Expression of the yciGFE operon is induced by several stresses and is regulated by RpoS, which controls the general stress response in E. coli. Therefore, we tested the ability of the mutant strains to survive environmental stresses. Our results revealed that YciG was important for stationary-phase resistance to thermal stress, oxidative stress and, in particular, acid stress. Both RpoS-dependent and RpoS-independent acid resistance mechanisms are found in E. coli. YciG was shown to be required for RpoS-independent acid resistance, but further experiments are needed to determine whether YciG also is required for RpoS-dependent acid resistance. YciG was not required for normal exponential growth of E. coli, as mutants lacking YciG had the same growth rate as the wild-type parent. No mutant phenotypes have been found yet for mutants lacking YciF or YciE. yciE deletion mutants showed the same growth rate and the same level of acid resistance as wild-type cells. The acid resistance of yciF mutants has not yet been tested, and strains lacking YciE and/or YciF need to be assayed for their ability to survive stresses other than acid stress.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Movement amplitude</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of amplitude scaling on bimanual coordination in a circle drawing task. Eleven right-handed subjects traced the perimeter of 5 circles measuring 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 cm in diameter under the following coordination conditions: (1) both hands move inward together (symmetric coordination pattern), and (2) both hands move counterclockwise together (asymmetric coordination pattern). In a set of self-paced trials, subjects traced each circle separately at a preferred frequency and separately for each coordination pattern. Although subjects matched the required amplitude of the target circles quite well, radial amplitude variability increased with increasing circle diameter. No transitions or movement reversals were observed in the self-paced trials, and the symmetric pattern was more stable than the asymmetric pattern. In a set of amplitude scaling trials, subjects continuously traced the 5 circles from small (3 cm) to big (15 cm) (SB) and from big to small (BS) at two fixed pacing frequencies (1.25 Hz and 1.5 Hz). Observed cycling frequency decreased with increasing circle diameter, and observed radial amplitude was most accurate when tracing the 9 cm diameter circle, with larger than required amplitude when tracing the 3 cm and 6 cm diameter circles, and smaller than required amplitude when tracing the 12 cm and 15 cm diameter circles. Radial amplitude variability also increased with increasing circle diameter in the amplitude scaling trials. The symmetric coordination pattern was more stable than the symmetric coordination pattern. Transitions from the asymmetric to symmetric coordination pattern as well as movement reversals were observed in both scaling directions. No transitions occurred while producing the symmetric pattern in any scaling direction or pacing frequency condition. The results show that amplitude scaling influenced the spatiotemporal aspects of bimanual circle drawing. Moreover, amplitude scaling induced more transitions than previous research that scaled movement frequency as a control parameter in bimanual circle drawing tasks.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Cancellous Bone</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Density</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This study focussed on the reduced platen compression (RPC) testing of the cancellous bone of the proximal tibia. The objective of this study was to improve the current testing methods with an emphasis on the location of the RPC specimens, and to correlate the mechanical properties of the rodent cancellous bone with the various density measures. Analytical studies were made to assess the effect of the size and shape of the platen based on the values from mechanical testing of the cancellous bone.  &#xd;
RPC specimens are made from transverse slices of the proximal tibia metaphysis. Specimen location was determined using planar radiograph method at a distance of 1.75 mm distal to the growth plate. The distance from the top of the proximal tibia to the line at 1.75 mm distal to the growth plate was measured and this distance is termed as the first cut distance. Specimen thickness of 2 mm was then cut for the RPC test. Endocortical method was followed to determine the platen sizing for RPC testing. The cancellous bone was then tested in compression to failure.  &#xd;
Correlations were performed between the mechanical properties of the cancellous bone and the density measures from pQCT and radiographic techniques. SigmaStat and TableCurve 2D were used to perform the correlations and estimate the P value for the correlation. Linear and power law fits were made for all the correlations.  &#xd;
Based on this study, several improvements to the reduced platen compression test were recommended. An improved specimen location method was developed. However, it requires a corrective distance to account for the tissue that cannot be identified in the radiographic analysis. A new method for estimating the density of the cancellous bone that is directly tested by the platen was developed. Correlations between the density of the cancellous bone and the mechanical properties show that, there is a strong correlation between ultimate stress and aluminum layer intensity. Elastic modulus correlates best with the last batch tested in this study. Recommendations for future study include advanced technology like finite element analysis and custom shaped platens to enhance RPC testing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study measured the actual water consumption of sanitary fixtures installed in restrooms of a university building while most studies have been based on the manufacturer's reported flow rate. Furthermore, this study analyzed the appropriateness of retrofitting with low-consumption water closets and urinals based on the actual water consumption.  &#xd;
The purpose of this study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of water savings from retrofitting water closets and urinals in restrooms of the Langford Architecture building A at Texas A&amp;M University. The researcher directly measured the actual water-volume per flush of as-is, tune-up, low-consumption manual, and low-consumption automatic water closets and urinals. The data collected by these observations was analyzed, and the researcher evaluated the water savings of retrofitting water closets and urinals.&#xd;
Finally, this study provides the actual water-consumption data of sanitary fixtures and proves that retrofitting with low-consumption fixtures can save on water costs. The results will present practical standards to facility managers and other building professionals and will also contribute to determining the feasibility of retrofitting water closets and urinals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The broad objective of this thesis involves investigation of the role agriculture might play in a society wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction effort. Specifically, the breakeven price for carbon emission offsets is calculated for agriculturally based emission reducing practices. The practices investigated in the Texas High Plains involve reduced tillage use, reduced fallow use, reduced crop fertilization, cropland conversion to grassland, feedlot enteric fermentation management and digester based dairy manure handling. Costs of emission reductions were calculated at the producer level.  &#xd;
The calculated offset prices are classified into four cost categories. They are: negative cost, low cost (less than $20 per ton of carbon saved), moderate cost ($20 through $100 per ton of carbon saved), and high cost (over $100 for tons of carbon saved). &#xd;
Negative cost implies that farmers could make money and reduce emissions by moving to alternative practices even without any carbon payments. Alternatives in the positive cost categories need compensation to induce farmers to switch to practices that sequester more carbon. &#xd;
All fallow dryland crop practices, dryland and irrigated cotton zero tillage, dryland and irrigated wheat zero tillage, irrigated corn zero tillage, cotton irrigated nitrogen use reduction under minimum tillage and dryland pasture for all systems, and anaerobic lagoon complete mix and plug flow systems fall in the negative cost category.  &#xd;
Dryland and irrigated wheat under minimum tillage are found to be in the low cost category. Cotton dryland under minimum tillage and cotton irrigated with nitrogen use reduction under zero tillage fell into the moderate cost class. Both corn and cotton irrigated minimum tillage are found to be in the high cost category. &#xd;
This study only considers the producer foregone net income less fixed costs as the only cost incurred in switching to an alternative sequestering practice. More costs such as learning and risk should probably be included. This limitation along with other constraints such as use of short run budget data, lack of availability and reliability of local budgets, overlooking any market effects, and lack of treatment of costs incurred in selling carbon offsets to buyers are limitations and portend future work.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Mutagenesis</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Kinetic</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase (CODH), also known as Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), is one of seven known Ni containing enzymes. CODH/ACS is a bifunctional enzyme which oxidizes CO to CO2 reversibly and synthesizes acetyl-CoA. Recently, X-ray crystal structures of homodimeric CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum (CODHRr) and CODH from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (CODHCh) have been published. These two enzymes catalyze only the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 and have a protein sequence homologous to that of the β subunit of heterotetrameric α2β2 enzyme from Moorella thermoacetica (CODHMt), formerly Clostridium thermoaceticum. Neither CODHRr nor CODHCh contain an α-subunit as is found in CODHMt. The precise structure of the active site for acetyl-CoA synthase, called the A-cluster, is not known. Therefore, crystallization of the α subunit is required to solve the remaining structural features of CODH/ACS. Obtaining crystals and determining the X-ray crystal structure is a high-risk endeavor, and a second project was pursued involving the preparation, expression and analysis of various site-directed mutants of CODHMt. Mutational analysis of particular histidine residues and various other conserved residues of CODH from Moorella thermoacetica is discussed. Visual inspection of the crystal structure of CODHRr and CODHCh, along with sequence alignments, indicates that there may be separate pathways for proton and electron transfer during catalysis. Mutants of a proposed proton transfer pathway were characterized.  Four semi-conserved histidine residues were individually mutated to alanine.  Two (His116Mt and His122Mt) were essential to catalysis, while the other two (His113Mt and His119Mt) attenuated catalysis but were not essential.  Significant activity was "rescued" by a double mutant where His116 was replaced by Ala and His was also introduced at position 115. Activity was also rescued in double mutants where His122 was replaced by Ala and His was simultaneously introduced at either position 121 or 123. Activity was also "rescued" by replacing His with Cys at position 116. Mutation of conserved Lys587 near the C-cluster attenuated activity but did not eliminate it. Activity was virtually abolished in a double mutant where Lys587 and His113 were both changed to Ala. Mutations of conserved Asn284 also attenuated activity. These effects suggest the presence of a network of amino acid residues responsible for proton transfer rather than a single linear pathway.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>industrial distribution</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Thirteen state-sponsored colleges and universities within the United States offer a bachelor level degree in Industrial Distribution. The first of these emerged in the 1950s in response to industry demands for unique educational preparation of entry-level professionals. Since the 1980s, increased sophistication in the field has accelerated the demand for educational preparation of Industrial Distribution professionals. &#xd;
The problem facing educators is to determine the mix of courses that will provide the appropriate curricular focus when developing or refining the programs at their individual institutions. In the first phase of this study, the curricular focus of the current bachelor level programs in Industrial Distribution is identified in the form of eight curricular groupings representing the required courses in those programs. &#xd;
The second phase of this study investigates the curricula of programs that contain a similar theme of focus at state-sponsored colleges and universities. The purpose is to identify programs other than formal Industrial Distribution programs, which have similar curricular focus, and may therefore provide graduates of similar educational preparation. In addition to providing educators with insight into the relationship between formal Industrial Distribution programs and those of similar theme, this portion of the study provides managers in the field with information to consider when evaluating schools as potential sources of new hires.&#xd;
State-sponsored schools in the study were identified from the membership of the American Association of State-Sponsored Colleges and Universities (AASCU). &#xd;
Findings included ninety-six institutions from the six most populous and six least populous states, as of the 2000 U.S. Census. These institutions provided a representative sample of the 387 colleges and universities currently members of AASCU.&#xd;
The identified schools offer over four hundred programs of similar theme to the thirteen formal Industrial Distribution programs. The overwhelming majority of those programs are in colleges of Business and Technology, and are generally marketed as supporting general or governmental business, with no reference in catalogs, and departmental literature or Internet websites as supporting fields directly identifiable with Industrial Distribution.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Thermal contact conductance is highly important in a wide variety of applications, from the cooling of electronic chips to the thermal management of spacecraft.  The demand for increased efficiency means that components need to withstand higher temperatures and heat transfer rates.  Many situations call for contact heat transfer through nominally cylindrical interfaces, yet relatively few studies of contact conductance through cylindrical interfaces have been undertaken.  This study presents a review of the experimental and theoretical investigations of the heat transfer characteristics of composite cylinders, presenting data available in open literature in comparison with relevant correlations.&#xd;
The present investigation presents a study of the thermal contact conductance of cylindrical interfaces.  The experimental investigation of sixteen different material combinations offers an opportunity to develop predictive correlations of the contact conductance, in conjunction with an analysis of the interface pressure as a function of the thermal state of the individual cylindrical shells.  Experimental results of the present study are compared with previously published conductance data and conductance models.</dc:description>

<dc:description>People are fascinated with death and disaster.  One simply has to watch traffic slow to a crawl when passing a car accident to understand this. However, this fascination goes beyond the side of a highway and enters the realm of tourism.  Today, numerous sites of death and disaster attract millions of visitors from all around the world: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Anne Frank's House, Graceland, Oklahoma City, Gettysburg, Vimy Ridge, the Somme, Arlington National Cemetery.  The list grows each year as exhibited by the recent creation of an apartheid museum in Johannesburg, South Africa.  Due to the increasing popularity of this tourism product, a small number of academics have begun studying the phenomenon. Leading the field are Lennon and Foley who labeled it Dark Tourism, Seaton who coined the term Thanatourism, and Rojek who developed the concept of Black Spots. However, despite ongoing study, there has been a paucity in understanding what actually motivates individuals to sites of dark tourism. Yet understanding motivation is imperative, particularly given the subject and sensitivity of these sites.  Some are slowly decaying, and visitors play a large role in their preservation. Subsequently, without proper management, visitor influxes can further deteriorate sites or induce friction with the locals. Knowledge then, also provides administrators the necessary tools to properly manage the varying stakeholders. Although many feel an interest in death and disaster simply stems from morbidity, the range of factors involved extend from an interest in history and heritage to education to remembrance. To begin this study, a list of possible motivations was compiled. Then, to get a better comprehension of these motivations, visitors to the Holocaust Museum Houston were surveyed as a case study. As a commodified, synthetic site of death and atrocity, the museum fits the definitions of a dark tourism site as established by lead academics. Therefore, by asking visitors to the museum what motivated them to the site, the results will hopefully give some acumen into the wants and needs of certain stakeholders. Finally, this research sought to discover if motivation at the museum could shed light on motivation to other sites of dark tourism.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>data reduction</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>classification</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This thesis presents a methodology for data aggregation for capacity management. It is assumed that there are a very large number of products manufactured in a company and that every product is stored in the database with its standard unit per hour and attributes that uniquely specify each product. The methodology aggregates products into families based on the standard units-per-hour and finds a subset of attributes that unambiguously identifies each family. Data reduction and classification are achieved using well-known multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis, variable selection and discriminant analysis. The experimental results suggest that the efficacy of the proposed methodology is good in terms of data reduction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study analyzes the economic and demographic patterns of at-home pork consumption for representative individuals over 18 years of age in the United States. Three data sets purchased by the National Pork Board (NPB) are mined for this purpose: (1) National Eating Trends (NET) data from National Panel Diary (NPD) on individuals' intake and their demographic characteristics; (2) weekly retail prices for fresh meats and fresh pork cuts from FreshLook; and (3) weekly retail prices for processed pork products from A.C. Nielsen.  &#xd;
Heckman sample selection models are used to find demographic, health, and attitudinal/lifestyle patterns of consumption of twelve fresh and processed pork products as well as beef, chicken, and seafood. In the fall, individuals have a higher probability of eating beef, chicken, pork tenderloin, and bacon, but a lower probability of eating fresh seafood, canned ham, and smoked ham relative to the spring. The New England region has the highest likelihood of eating fresh pork, beef, chicken, seafood, pork roasts, pork tenderloin, and pork hotdogs. Blacks, on average, eat more fresh and processed pork, chicken, pork sausage, bacon, and canned ham, but less beef relative to whites. Concern about serving food with fat is negatively related with the likelihood of eating processed pork, lunchmeat, ham, and bacon, but it is positively related with the likelihood of eating pork hotdogs. &#xd;
A three-stage selectivity-adjusted censored LA/AIDS model is developed and estimated to find demand-price relationships for: (1) fresh meats (pork, beef, chicken, and seafood) and (2) nine fresh and processed pork cuts. However, aggregate fresh meats are substitutes for each other in at-home market, but there are substantial complementarities between pork cuts. Pork sausage is the major competitor for the processed products, pork roasts and pork tenderloin, but a major complement for pork ribs. There is relatively week substitutability between pork and beef, and relatively strong substitutability between pork and chicken and between beef and chicken. This could suggest opportunities for some joint marketing efforts between pork and beef commodity interests.&#xd;
This information can be used as a guide for marketing strategists for targeting and promotion as well as for category management of the disaggregated pork products.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Understanding the internal organization of the Lower Pleistocene 8 Sand reservoir in the Green Canyon 18 field, Gulf of Mexico, helps to increase knowledge of the geology and the petrophysical properties, and hence contribute to production management in the area. Interpretation of log data from 29 wells, core and production data served to detail as much as possible a geological model destined for a future reservoir simulation.&#xd;
 	Core data showed that the main facies resulting from fine-grained turbidity currents is composed of alternating sand and shale layers, whose extension is assumed to be large. They correspond to levee and overbank deposits that are usually associated to channel systems. The high porosity values, coming from unconsolidated sediment, were associated to high horizontal permeability but generally low kv/kh ratio. &#xd;
        The location of channel deposits was not obvious but thickness maps suggested that two main systems, with a northwest-southeast direction, contributed to the 8 Sand formation deposition. These two systems were not active at the same time and one of them was probably eroded by overlying formations. Spatial relationships between them remained unclear. Shingled stacking of the channel deposits resulted from lateral migration of narrow, meandering leveed channels in the mid part of the turbidite system. Then salt tectonics tilted turbidite deposits and led to the actual structure of the reservoir. The sedimentary analysis allowed the discrimination of three facies A, B and E, with given porosity and permeability values, that corresponded to channel, levee and overbank deposits. They were used to populate the reservoir model. Well correlation helped figure out the extension of these facies.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Substation Integration</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Data Collecting</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Measurement Processing</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The issue of substation integration is recognized as a very important one ever since the process of technological development brought a multitude of new computer-based devices and functions into substation operation. During the relatively short time period after the first microprocessors were invented, a myriad of computer-based devices found their application in power engineering. Those devices had a variety of input and output data formats, which hampered exchange of data among different devices.&#xd;
Recent initiatives for standardization of substation data formats and communication protocols have progressed to facilitate production of devices with standardized data formats and data exchange capabilities. Central substation computers now have an opportunity to collect and process data from such computer-based devices.&#xd;
An advanced data collecting and processing solution is developed and implemented as Integrated Substation Software in an effort to enhance substation integration. This report describes a solution that comprises data generation using a substation model, data collecting from modeled apparatus and instruments and finally application of data processing and consistency checking algorithms for creating outputs. The process of data collecting and processing is automated and repeated in equidistant time intervals. Results of processing and related reports are concisely displayed on the user interface screen and exported through data files.&#xd;
The Substation Integration Software was tested through the set of scenarios where each scenario is used to test one of the processing and consistency checking algorithms. The results show that measurements are improved and applicable for usage by other substation and system-wide applications.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>d-bar problem</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Kobayashi Metric</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>compact Neumann operator</dc:subject>
<dc:description>We study the ∂-Neumann&#xd;
operator and the Kobayashi metric. We observe that under certain&#xd;
conditions, a higher-dimensional domain fibered over Ω can&#xd;
inherit noncompactness of the d-bar-Neumann&#xd;
operator from the base domain Ω. Thus we have  a domain&#xd;
which has noncompact d-bar-Neumann operator but&#xd;
does not necessarily have the standard conditions which usually&#xd;
are satisfied with noncompact d-bar-Neumann operator.&#xd;
 We define the property K which is related to the Kobayashi metric and  gives&#xd;
information about holomorphic structure of  fat subdomains. We&#xd;
find an equivalence between compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator and the property K in any convex domain.&#xd;
 We also find a local property of the Kobayashi metric [Theorem IV.1], in&#xd;
which the domain is not necessary pseudoconvex.&#xd;
&#xd;
 We find a more&#xd;
general condition than finite type for the local regularity of the&#xd;
d-bar-Neumann operator  with the vector-field&#xd;
method. By this generalization,  it is possible for an analytic&#xd;
disk to be on the part of boundary where we have   local&#xd;
regularity of the d-bar-Neumann operator. By Theorem V.2, we show that an isolated infinite-type point in the&#xd;
boundary of the domain is not an obstruction for the local&#xd;
regularity of the d-bar-Neumann operator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Good failure analysis is the ability to determine the site of a circuit defect quickly and accurately.  We propose a method for defect site prediction that is based on a site's probability of excitation, making no assumptions about the type of defect being analyzed.  We do this by analyzing fault signatures and comparing them to the defect signature.  We use this information to construct an ordered list of sites that are likely to be the site of the defect.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>globalization</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>discourse</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>critical</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Globalization has, within academic, political and business circles alike, become a prominent buzzword of the past decade, conjuring a diversity of associations, connotations and attendant mythologies.  The literature devoted to the issue of globalization is both vast in scope and diverse in nature, becoming increasingly prominent not only in academics and politics, but in the popular press, as well. The goal of this dissertation is to provide the reader with a map of themes, narratives, and characterizations related to globalization circulating in the United States in order to demonstrate the potential ways that individual thought on the issue is shaped by public discourse. A secondary goal is to critically examine specific texts to identify areas where their arguments overlap, conflict, or may be misconstrued due to weak or inaccurate evidence.  By better understanding the map of rhetorical formations in widely-read texts regarding globalization, it may be possible for people to be better able to understand the concerns and intentions of those voicing various and often competing viewpoints.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The research in this dissertation examines the chemistry and applications of dendrimers in homogeneous catalysis.  We examined interactions between dendrimers and charged probe molecules, prepared dendrimer-encapsulated metal nanoparticles in organic solvents, studied size-selectivity of dendrimer-encapsulted catalysts, and designed molecular rulers as in-situ probes to measure the location of dendrimer-encapsulted metal nanoparticles. &#xd;
The intrinsic proton binding constant and a constant that characterizes the strength of electrostatic interactions among occupied binding sites in poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers have been obtained by studying the effect of solution pH on the protonation of the dendrimers.  The significant finding is that these two factors are greatly modulated by the unique and hydrophobic microenvironment in the dendrimer interior. &#xd;
Hydrophilic poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers were modified with various hydrophobic alkyl chains through an amide linkage and were then used as templates for preparing intradendrimer copper nanoclusters.  The main driving force for encapsulating metal-ions was found to be the differences in metal-ion solubility between the solvent and the interior of the dendrimer.  &#xd;
Nanometer-sized metal particles are synthesized and encapsulated into the interior of dendrimers by first mixing together the dendrimer and metal ion solution and then reducing the composite chemically, and the resulting dendrimer-encapsulated metal nanoparticles can then be used as catalysts.  By controlling the packing density on the dendrimer periphery using either different dendrimer generations or dendrimer surface functionalities, it is possible to control access of substrates to the encapsulated catalytic nanoparticle. &#xd;
Molecular rulers consisting of a large molecular "stopper", a reactive probe and a linker were designed as in-situ probes for determining the average distance between the surface of dendrimer-encapsulated palladium nanoparticles and the periphery of their fourth-generation, hydroxyl-terminated PAMAM dendrimer hosts. By doing so, we avoid having to make assumptions about the nanoparticle size and shape.  The results suggest that the surface of the encapsulated nanoparticle is situated 0.7 ± 0.2 nm from the surface of the dendrimer.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>collision</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>dependence</dc:subject>
<dc:description>It has been proposed to use heavy ion beams with energies around 10 MeV/amu, masses around 200, and average charges of 1+ as a driver for inertial fusion reactor. Current designs require the beams to travel through a region where the background gas pressure is several milli-torr. Thus, it is important to assess the rate at which the charge state of an incident beam evolves while passing through the background gas. The first objective of this project is to study the dependence of cross sections for multi-electron loss on target atomic number by using 6 MeV/amu Xe18+ ions and to compare the results with the n-body Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo calculations. A secondary objective of this project is to determine the extent to which the cross sections for molecular targets can be represented as sum of the cross sections for their atomic constituents. &#xd;
Cross sections for loss of one through eight electrons from 6 MeV/amu Xe18+ in single collisions have been measured with noble gas targets. The target Z-dependence of the total loss cross section was found to be well represented by two straight line segments. The cross section for He and Ne define one straight line segment and those for Ar, Kr and Xe define the other, where exhibits a smaller slope. The predictions of n-CTMC calculations are in good agreement with the measured total electron loss cross sections. A semiempirical fitting procedure based on the independent electron approximation provided a reasonably good representation of the individual cross sections for all of the noble gas targets. Additional measurements performed with a variety of molecular targets provided a rigorous test of cross section additivity and showed that the additivity rule works well for electron loss from heavy ions in the present energy and charge regime. A semiempirical calculation based the IEA shows that the average most probable impact parameter for electron loss is much smaller than the target molecular bond length. This result is believed to account for the finding of the insensitivity of the electron loss cross section to molecular structure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>For more than 100 years, Pennsylvanian permineralized peats have been studied for their exceptionally preserved plant remains. Late Atokan-early Desmoinesian coal balls from the Williamson # 3 deposit in south-central Iowa were preserved by the permineralization of soluble carbonate into pores in the peat and plant cells creating carbonate nodules. These nodules, referred to as coal balls, protect the plant remains from the compaction associated with coal allowing for the analysis of anatomically preserved plants from Pennsylvanian.&#xd;
	The Williamson #3 deposit is unusual because it is dominated by a diverse assemblage of gymnosperms. Other deposits of similar age in Iowa are dominated by a mixture of cordaitalean gymnosperms, tree-ferns, and medullosan gymnosperms; while, other North American deposits are dominated by lycopsids with tree-ferns and seed-ferns as the subdominant vegetation. Because vegetation types differ with environment, analysis of the Alethopteris pinnules from the Williamson #3 Mine provides insight into the ecology of a peat-producing swamp during the Pennsylvanian, and allows for the comparison of this deposit to others in North America.&#xd;
	The focus of this study is the description of a distinct morphotype of Alethopteris from the Williamson #3 Mine. Alethopteris pinnules described from other mines were used to compile a traits list and compare measured and descriptive characteristics. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of changes in swamp vegetation during the Pennsylvanian, and the effect of environmental variation on the dominant vegetation in peat swamps.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Flywheel energy storage units have become a viable alternative to electrochemical batteries in applications such as satellites, uninterrupted power supplies, and hybrid vehicles.  However, this performance is contingent upon safe operation since these flywheels can release their stored energy almost instantaneously upon failure.  The research presented here investigates a health monitoring technology that may give an early indication of degraded material properties in a concentric ring composite flywheel.  The existence of degraded material properties is manifested as a change in mass eccentricity due to asymmetric growth of the outermost flywheel ring.  A test rig concept to investigate the technology is developed in detail using a systems engineering design process.  Successful detection of the change in mass eccentricity was verified analytically through dynamic modeling of the flywheel rotor and magnetic suspension system.  During steady state operation detection was determined to be feasible via measurements of the magnetic bearing currents and shaft position provided by the magnetic suspension feedback sensors.  A rotordynamic analysis was also conducted and predicts successful operation to the maximum operating speed of 50,000 Rpm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A design for a novel tubular high-precision direct-drive brushless linear motor has been developed.  The novelty of the design lies in the orientation of the magnets in the mover.  In conventional linear motors the magnets of the armature are arranged such that the attractive poles are adjacent throughout, in an NS-NS-NS orientation, where N denotes the north pole and S denotes the south pole of the magnet.  In the new design, the magnets in the moving part are oriented in an NS-NS-SN-SN orientation. This change in orientation yields greater magnetic field intensity near the like-pole region. The magnets of the mover are encased within a brass tube, which slides through a three-phase array of current-carrying coils.  As the coils are powered, they induce a force on the permanent magnets according to the Lorentz force equation.  The primary advantages of the motor are its compact nature, fast, precise positioning due to its low-mass moving part, direct actuation, extended travel range, and ability to extend beyond its base.  The linear motor is used in conjunction with a position sensor, power amplifiers, and a controller to form a complete solution for positioning and actuation requirements. &#xd;
Controllers were developed for two applications, with a lead-lag as the backbone of each.  For the first application, the principal requirements are for fast rise and settling times. For the second application, the primary requirement is for near-zero overshoot.  With the controller for application 1, the motor has a rise time of 55 ms, a settling time of 600 ms, and 65% overshoot. With the controller for application 2 implemented, the motor has a rise time of 1 s, a settling time of 2.5 s, and 0.2% overshoot. The maximum force capability of the motor is measured to be 26.4 N.  The positioning resolution is 35 ?m.  This thesis discusses the motor's physical design, construction, implementation, testing, and tuning.  It includes specifications of the components of the motor and other necessary equipment, desired and actual motor performance, and the primary limitations on the precision of the system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A risk review of a fuel cell-based distributed co-generation (FC-Based DCG) system was conducted to identify and quantify the major technological system risks in a worst-case scenario.  A risk review entails both a risk assessment and a risk analysis of a designed system, and it is part of risk engineering.  Thorough literature reviews and expert interviews were conducted in the field of fuel cells.  A thorough literature review of the risk engineering field was also conducted.  A procedure for a risk review of the FC-Based DCG System was developed.  The representative system design was identified by the current DCG design technology.  The risk assessment was carried out, identifying the system components and potential failure modes and consequences.  Then, using probabilities of failure for the various system components, the risk associated with a particular system design was determined.  A Monte Carlo simulation on the total system reliability was used to evaluate the potential for system failure at a time of 1 hour, 5 hours, 10 hours, 50 hours, 100 hours and 500 hours of continuous operation.  The original system was found to be acceptable at the initial times, but after 100 hours was predicted to fail.  The components which consistently contribute significantly to the overall system risk are the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the nickel-metal foam flow fields.  A revised system was analyzed with the reliability of the MEA and the Ni-foam set to 100%.  After the revision, the components which contributed significantly to the system risk were the pumps.   Simulations were run for several alternative systems to provide feedback on risk management suggestions.  The risk engineering process developed with the design approach for this research is applicable to any system and it accommodates the use of many different risk engineering tools.</dc:description>

<dc:description>IDDQ testing has been a very useful test screen for CMOS circuits. However, with each technology node the background leakage of chips is rapidly increasing. As a result it is becoming more difficult to distinguish between faulty and fault-free chips using IDDQ testing. Power supply partitioning has been proposed to increase test resolution by partitioning the power supply network, such that each partition has a relatively small defect-free IDDQ level. However, at present no practical partitioning strategy is available. The contribution of this thesis is to present a practical power supply partitioning strategy. &#xd;
We formulate various versions of the power supply partitioning problem that are likely to be of interest depending on the constraints of the chip design. Solutions to all the variants of the problem are presented. The basic idea behind all solutions is to abstract the power topology of the chip as a flow network. We then use flow techniques to find the min-cut of the transformed network to get solutions to our various problem formulations. Experimental results for benchmark circuits verify the feasibility of our solution methodology. The problem formulations will give complete flexibility to a test engineer to decide which factors cannot be compromised (e.g. area of BICS, test quality, etc) for a particular design and accordingly choose the appropriate problem formulation. The application of this work will be the first step in the placement of Built-In Current Sensors for IDDQ testing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A new design AMTEC converter model was developed, and its effectiveness as a design tool was evaluated.  To develop the model, requirements of the model were defined, several new design models were successively developed, and finally an optimal new design model was developed.  The model was created within Sinda/Fluint, with its graphical interface, Thermal Desktop, a software package that can be used to conduct complex thermal and fluid analyses.  Performance predictions were then correlated and compared with actual performance data from the Road Runner II AMTEC converter.  Predicted performance results were within 10% of actual performance data for all operating conditions analyzed.  This accuracy tended to increase within operating ranges that would be more likely encountered in AMTEC applications.  Performance predictions and parametric design studies were then performed on a proposed new design converter model with a variety of annular condenser heights and with potassium as a working fluid to evaluate the effects of various design modifications.  Results clearly indicated the effects of the converter design modifications on the converter's power and efficiency, thus simplifying the design optimization process.  With the close correlation to actual data and the design information obtained from parametric studies, it was determined that the model could serve as an effective tool for the design of AMTEC converters.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Soluble polymers as supports are gaining more attention now. Developing new polymers, new reagents and catalysts, new separation systems are thus of great interest as these sorts of materials' applications in synthesis and catalysis increase. The work described in the succeeding chapters describes my efforts to synthesize new catalysts that can be attached to polymer supports, to study their catalytic activity and to study separation efficiency. Most of the work focus is on polyacrylamide polymers. Both organometallic catalysts and organic catalysts have been studied. Liquid/liquid separation was the technique mainly investigated. In addition, a new separation scheme called latent biphasic system which is a new liquid/liquid separation method is described. Finally, studies with the Cremer group where the LCST behavior of polyacrylamides was studied using dark field methods are also discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The internet revolution has led to the demand for high speed, low cost solutions for providing high bandwidth to the consumers. Cable and DSL systems address these requirements through sophisticated analog and digital signal processing schemes. A key element of the analog front end of such systems is the line driver which interfaces with the transmission medium such as co-axial cable or twisted pair. &#xd;
The line driver is an amplifier that provides the necessary output current to drive the low impedance of the line. The main requirements for design are high output swing, high linearity, matched impedance to the line and power efficiency. These requirements are addressed by a class AB amplifier whose output impedance can be controlled through feedback. The property of this topology is that when the gain is unity, the output resistance of the driver is matched to the line resistance.&#xd;
Unity gain is achieved for varying line conditions through a tuning loop consisting of peak-to-peak detectors and differential difference amplifier. The design is fabricated in 0.5 micron AMI CMOS process technology. For line variations from 65 to 170 ohms, the gain is unity with an error of 3 % and the impedance matching error is 20 % at the worst-case. The linearity is better than 50 dB for a 1.2 V peak-to-peak signal over the signal bandwidth from 10 kHz to 5 MHz and the line resitance range from 65 to 160 ohms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this work we have made use of a geometric approach which quantifies robustness and performance and we finally combine them using a cost function. In particular, we calculate the robustness&#xd;
      of the estimate of standard deviation of nominally Laplacian distribution. As this distribution is imperfectly known,&#xd;
       we employ a more general family, the generalized Gaussian; Laplacian distribution, is one of the members of this family.&#xd;
       We compute parameter estimates and present a classical algorithm which is then analyzed for distribution from the generalized Gaussian family.&#xd;
       We calculate the mean squared error according to the censoring height k.&#xd;
       We measure performance as a function of (1/MSE) and combine it with robustness using a cost criterion and design&#xd;
       a robust estimator which optimizes a mix of performance and robustness specified by the user.</dc:description>
