<dc:description>A new quinoxaline derivative (NHOPD) was synthesized by a one step reaction between
ninhydrin and o-phenylenediamine . It formed metal complex when reacted with
CuCl2.2H2O in ethanolic chloroform medium .The quinoxaline derivative(NHOPD) was
characterized on the basis of IR,NMR,MS and UV-VIS spectral data.
The Cu-NHOPD complex was characterized by analytical, conductivities, spectral
(AAS,IR,UV-VIS) and magnetic data. Involvement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen and
one of the quinoxaline nitrogen in coordination was concluded, such that the ligand
behaved as a neutral ON bidentate. Conductance measurement indicates a 1:2 electrolytic
nature of the complex .Electronic spectral and magnetic susceptibility data suggest
square planar geometry for the complex with molecular formula [CuL2]Cl2.2H20
(L=NHOPD)</dc:description>

<dc:description>The concentration of nine essential metals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cr, Ni) and two non-
essential and toxic metals (Cd, Pb) were determined in leaves of the same species of Croton
macrostachyus collected from four different areas (Akaki, Abomsa, Bonga and Dilla) and
infusions of leaves collected from Akaki using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS).
An optimized digestion procedure was selected based upon less reagent consumption, digestion
time and mass of sample using 2 mL of HNO3 and 2 mL of HClO4 with 2:30 hours total time at
temperature round 270 oC for digestion of 0.5 g of powder sample while 4 mL of HNO3 and 1
mL of HClO4 with 2:30 hours total time for 25 mL infusion evaporated up to 3 mL. The validity
of the optimized procedure was evaluated by the analysis of spiked samples whose recovery was
in the range 92-103% for the Croton leaves powder and 94-105% for the infusion samples. The
mean concentration range of each metal in Croton leaves powder samples were Ca (1202–7040
μg/g), Mg (271–2961 μg/g), Fe (169–581 μg/g ), Mn (157–1776 μg/g), Zn (19.7–60.5 μg/g), Cu
(6.31–18.6 μg/g), Co (19.7–34.5 μg/g), Cr (21.3–87.5 μg/g), Ni (2.65–26.2 μg/g), Cd (1.08 –
0.75 μg/g) and Pb (10.5–21.9 μg/g) for the Croton leave powders and Ca (467–1087 μg/g), Mg
(13.9–52.6 μg/g), Fe (3.43–6.53 μg/g), Mn (2.17–3.42 μg/g), Zn (2.24–9.51 μg/g), Cu (2.17–
2.54 μg/g), Co (2.15–2.83 μg/g), Cr (2.61–13.44 μg/g), Ni (2.17–2.80 μg/g), Cd (0.207 μg/g)
and Pb (0.371–2.07 μg/g) for the infusion samples. The Croton leave powders contained more
amounts of metals than the infusions and it was rich in Ca to a largest extent followed by Mg and
Fe for Akaki and Abomsa and for Bonga and Dilla sites, respectively. Fe concentration was
determined to be the highest followed by Cr and Zn out of the trace microelements Croton leaves
powder taken from Akaki and Abomsa whereas Mn concentration was the second next to Ca for
Bonga and Dilla sites. The metals were observed to leach in to the infusions at a rate highest for
Ca (61.5%) in the 24 h infusion and lowest for Fe (1%) in the 3 h infusion. The concentrations of
metals in the Ethiopian Croton macorostachyus are comparable to values for other medicinal
plants reported in other parts of the world. Poor correlation was observed between Mn as well as
x
Co with almost all metals Croton leave powder samples and good correlation between all metals
in Croton leaves infusion was observed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The chemical constituents in EtOAc extract of the Ethiopian traditional medicinal plant
‘Dingetegna”, Taverniera abyssinica, were reinvestigated and the claimed antispasmodic activity
of them were examined. The chemical constituents were isolated and purified by various
chromatographic methods and their structures were elucidated mainly by NMR. The two
compounds isolated were identified as 3-hydroxy-9-methoxypterocarpan, a known compound
called medicarpin and 3,4-dihydroxypterocarpan (4-hydroxymedicarpin). Both compounds
antagonized the histamine induced contraction of guinea pig ileum. Medicarpin was more active
than its natural derivative 4-hydroxymedicarpin.</dc:description>

oximate and phen groups. The Ni(II) complex of the oximate has square-planar geometry and
the phen has octahedral goemetry. And the Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of the oximate and the
phen have octahedral geometry. Mononuclear complex of Zn(II) with phendione N,N’
coordinated was the precursor for mononuclear complex of Zn(II) with phedioxime N,N’
octahedral coordinated by the phen group and the hetronuclear complex of Ni(II) with the
mononuclear Zn-phendioxime complex was synthesized and characterized by template method.
The Zn(II) and Ni(II) species coordinated by N,N’ of the phen and oximate groups, respectively.
The Zn(II) moiety coordinated through N,N’ of the phen has octahedral geometry and the Ni(II)
moiety coordinated through N,N’ of the oximate has tetrahedral geometry. Structures of the
ligand and its complex is proposed and formulated according to the elemental analysis, 1H, 13C
NMR, UV-Vis and AAS, molar conductivity and magnetic susceptibility..</dc:description>

<dc:description>Abstract
The concentrations of trace essential metals (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) and toxic
heavy metals (Cd, Pb) in the Ethiopian landrace lentil samples were determined by
using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. A wet digestion procedure, using
mixtures of HNO3, HClO4 and H2O2, was developed for the decomposition of
powdered lentil samples. The accuracy of the method was checked by the standard
addition method. The contents of the analyzed heavy metals ranged between 0.009
and 0.013 for Cd, 0.285 and 0.360 for Co, 0.226 and 0.282 for Cu, 9.17 and 11.91 for
Fe, 6.7 and 8.2 for Mn, 0.120 and 0.244 for Ni, 0.142 and 0.176 for lead and 8.62 and
10.03 for Zn, all in mg/100 g. The results were compared with values reported in the
literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Abstract
In the course of this project, the synthesis of polyquinoxaline copolymers was
attempted. Monomer 5,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(5-butylthiophen-3-
yl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (51) was synthesized successfully. Two copolymers
based on quinoxaline and fluorene derivatives were synthesized by using Suzuki
coupling polymerization reaction. These were, poly(2,3-bis-(5-butyl-thiophen-2-
yl)-5-[5-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2-yl)-thiophen-2-yl]-8-thiophen-2-yl-quinoxaline)
(59) and poly(2,3-bis-(5-butyl-thiophen-2-yl)-5-[5-(9,9-dibenzyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-
thiophen-2-yl]-8-thiophen-2-yl-quinoxaline) (61). These polymers were
characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra, UV-Vis spectra and cyclic
voltammetery. Attempts also made to prepare cyclopentadithiophene starting
from 3-bromothiophen. However, this synthesis was not accomplished.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Abstracts
New Ni(II) complex was synthesized from 4-phenoxy-2,6-dichloro-straizine
and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in the presence of hydrated
metal salt, Nicl2.6H2O in 1,4-dioxane-methanol medium. Before the
synthesis of the complex, 4-phenoxy-2,6-dichloro-s-traizine was
prepared according to the procedure reported. The complex
synthesized was characterized on the bases of chemical analysis,
magnetic susceptibility, uv-vis spectroscopy and conductivity data.
Based on the data obtained octahedral geometry is proposed.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Chromium Speciation Based on Selected Schiff’s Bases: Attempted Investigations and Analytical Applications</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Belayneh, Getahun</dc:creator>
<dc:contributor>Dr. Negussie Megersa</dc:contributor>
<dc:description>ABSTRACT
Liquid-lquid extractive and UV-Vis spectrophotometric methods were attempted for
speciation analysis of chromium. To do this, some laboratory-synthesized ligands (isatinthiosemicarbazone,
dihydrazine ninhydrin and ninhydrin semicarbazone) and a
commercially available ligand, phenanthroline, ware used. There have been found that
they are inappropriate for both analytical applications. However, the chemical properties
may support some preconcentration or spectrophotometric applications. Suggestions for
these possible applications are therefore forwarded for future studies.

<dc:description>The metal contents of raw and roasted coffee varieties that are grown in five different parts of
Ethiopia; (Wollega, Sidamo, Harar, Benchi Maji and Kafa zones) have been analyzed. The
representative samples of these coffee varieties were collected from Coffee Quality Inspection
and Liquoring Center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Different digestion procedures were tested by
varying reagent volumes, time of digestion, temperature of digestion, types of reagents and
amount of the sample to develop a procedure that consume less reagent volume, short digestion
time, low temperature of digestion and smaller mass of the sample. The optimal procedure
required 4 hours and consumes 5 mL HNO3 (70 %) and 1.5 mL HClO4 (70 %) to completely
digest 0.5 g of both raw and roasted coffee samples. The accuracy of the optimized procedure
was evaluated by analyzing the digest of the spiked samples. Recoveries of the spiked samples
varired from 85 to 115 % and 84 to 120 % for raw and roasted coffees, respectively.
Concentrations of metals; (Ca, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were analyzed by
fame atomic absorption spectrometer employing a four point external calibration curve. The
observed metal concentrations in roasted coffee varieties are relatively higher than their
corresponding raw varieties. The metals levels observed in both raw and roasted coffee varieties
are comparable with their corresponding world wide reported values with the exception of Cr, Cd
and Pb that are differing from the reported values. Indeed, the study has revealed the existence of variation of metal composition of coffee beans with the geographical origin in which coffee
plants grow.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The catalytic and material properties of vanadium compounds and their effects in biological
systems have long provided the impetus and fuel to studies of vanadium science. The expanding
knowledge of the role of vanadium in biological systems and of the potential of vanadium
compounds as therapeutic agents has led continuously increasing interest in the coordination
chemistry and solution chemistry of this element. Vanadium complexes with mixed ligands
containing oxygen and nitrogen atoms are known to have high redox stability. In this context, the
ninhydrin-semicarbazone Schiff base ligand with nitrogen and oxygen coordinating atoms was
chosen for this study.
The oxovanadium (IV) complex of the type [VO(DSCI] has been prepared using template
method of synthesis with Schiff base ligand derived by condensation of ninhydrin and
semicarbazide wherein the VO2+ cation acts as a template. Tentative structure of the complex has
been proposed on the basis of characterization by electrical conductance, magnetic moment and
electronic spectra. The oxovanadium (IV) complex is a five coordinated square-pyramidal
wherein the Schiff base ligand acts as a tetradentate ONNO donor coordinating via the
azomethine nitrogen atoms and enolized oxygen atoms of the amide group. The assignment of
the geometry is corroborated by magnetic moment and electrical conductance measurements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two new Fe (III) complexes of two different geometries were synthesized from a
pentadentate ONONO donor ligand. The Schiff base ligand, BNSHIO, Bis-(N-
Salicylaldehyde)-1,3-inden-2-one was prepared and analyzed from our laboratory [7, 9,
10]. Ninhydrin, hydrazine hydrate, and salicylaldehyde were the precursors used in
ligand synthesis. This ligand, by direct condensation with Fe(III) resulted in the
formation of a new high spin complex, Fe(III)LD. Another new Fe(III)LT was
synthesized by template method using the same precursors. Initially 1,3-Dihydrazono-
inden-2-one (DHIO) was prepared by condensing ninhydrin with hydrazine hydrate,
which was treated with Fe(III) and salicylaldehyde and refluxed. This resulted in a low
spin complex, Fe (III)LT. The ligand to metal ratio was found to be 1:1 in both
complexes. Fe (III)LT was found to be a cationic complex and Fe(III)LD was found to
be a neutral complex. Based on the analytical, conductance, spectral, magnetic
susceptibility, AAS, and UV-Vis, data, Fe (III)LD was proposed to have an octahedral
geometry and Fe(III)LT was proposed a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. In both
complexes, the ligand behaves as a pentadentate ONONO donor.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Abstract
Electrochemical behaviour and electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen has been studied at
PoPDA, and PEDOT mutiwall carbon nano-tube (MWCNT) composite film modified glassy
carbon electrode. Cyclic and rotating disk voltammetric techniques were used to investigate
the electrocatalytic activity of MWCNT composite film electrodes for oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR). Glassy carbon electrodes modified with multiwall carbon nanotube by
casting functionalized carbon nanotube was electropolymerized by using oPDA and EDOT.
Koutecky-levich analysis at rotating disk electrode made possible to evaluate the kinetic
parameters; total number of exchanged electron, limiting current, Tafel slope and exchange
current density. Composites of PoPDA multi-wall carbon nanotube shows enhanced
electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction but the composite of PEDOT does not
show electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The concentrations of essential (Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn) and non-essential metals (Cd
and Pb) in Ethiopian red pepper samples were determined because such studies have not been
reported in the literature. The pepper samples were collected from Alaba, Mareko and Addis
Ababa open market (Merkato) and analyzed for metals using flame atomic absorption
spectroscopy after wet digestion. The metal concentrations in the samples were found to be
161-222 μg/g, 1.02-2.24 μg/g, 27.5-73.6 μg/g, 2.12-3.71 μg/g, 99.5-157 μg/g, 9.72-18.95 μg/g,
2.71-6.68 μg/g and 20.8-58.4 μg/g for calcium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese,
nickel and zinc respectively. The mean levels of metals (Fe and Ca) in the red pepper samples
from Alaba were found to be highest Co, Cu, Ni and Zn were found in the highest level in
Mareko than with in Alaba and Merkato peppers. While chromium and manganese were
available with maximum levels in Merkato peppers.
The concentrations of metals in Ethiopia pepper were comparable to values reported in
literature from different parts of the world.
The trace metals levels in either sample were found to be lower than the WHO allowed limit.
However Cr is found above the limit.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Donor/Acceptor-Copolymers,
as
so-called
“low-band-gap”
π-conjugated
polymers, have been widely investigated and applied in different areas such as
organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic
field effect transistors (OFETs). Due to the attractive features of those functional
organic polymer materials such as light weight, flexibility and low cost of
production they have attracted recent interest in research development.
In the course of this project, the synthesis of polyfluorene copolymers was
attempted. Monomers based on quinoxaline, namely, 5,8-bis-(5-bromo-thiophen-
2-yl-2,3-bis(4-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline was successfully synthesized. Two
copolymers, namely, poly[5-(5-(9,9-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethyl]-7-methyl-9H-
fluoren-2-yl}-thiophen-2-yl)-8-(5-methyl-thiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis-(4-octyloxyphenyl)-
quinoxaline] and poly[5-(5-(7-(7-(9,9-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethyl]-9H-fluoren-
2-yl)-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-9,9-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethyl]-9H-fluoren-

<dc:description>The electrochemical behavior of catechol was investigated using square wave
voltammetry with anthraquinone modified CPE and was found to be very sensitive. The
modified electrodes showed an enhancement of current response for catechol as
compared to the unmodified carbon paste electrode. Two varieties of tea, namely Green
tea, and Wush Wush tea were investigated. Responses for the extracts using ethanol:
water mixture showed green tea to be superior in catechol content.
Optimization of different variables such as pH of working solution, modifier composition
and square wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude and step potential were made
to improve the method efficiency during the experiment. The reproducibility for the nine
repeated analysis of 80 μmolL-1 of catechol gave a relative standard deviation of 3.65%,
indicating excellent reproducibility of the method. Linear calibration plots were obtained
in the range 6 to 80 μmolL-1 with (R = 0.99853) and the detection limit with (S/N=3) was
as low as 2.155x10-7 molL-1.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with electropolymerized film of 4-amino-3-
hydroxynaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (AHNSA) in pH 5.0 acetate buffer solution (ABS). Cyclic
voltammetry and square voltammetry were used as the analytical technique to compare the sensitivity of
the modified glassy carbon electrode with bare glassy carbon electrode. Fenitrothion detection for
different concentrations was performed by square wave voltammetry in pH 5.0 acetae buffer solution
(ABS). The irreversible reduction peak current which is at -594 mV is linear with the fenitrothion
concentration in the range of 4.0 x 10-6 – 2.0 x 10-5 M, and the detection limit is
8.0 x 10
-8
M. As a
result, the square wave voltammetry at modified glassy carbon electrode provides a better sensitivity and
it is faster and less expensive than traditional ones, such as, high performance liquid chromatography or
gas chromatography, which is time consuming, expensive and can not be carried out in field 34-36.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Tea leaves are very rich in fluoride, since the tea plant take up fluoride from the soil and
accumulate in its leaves. Depending upon the fluoride content of the water, dried tea leaves are
also able to absorb fluoride from water with high fluoride level. In this study, the possible effect
of original fluoride concentration in natural water on the fluoride release from tea has been
investigated and also conductivity, salinity, TDS and pH of naturally fluoride rich water and the
tea infusions prepared in deionized water, tap water and fluoride rich water have been
determined. Moreover, the possible capacity of tea leaves (commercially available tea) to absorb
fluoride from naturally high-fluoride water which were collected from Ethiopia Rift Valley
where the fluoride level of water is high has been investigated.
Infused fluoride content, conductivity, salinity, TDS and pH of black (either powder or bag
form) and green (bag form) teas and different water (sampled from Ethiopia Rift Valley) were
assayed. Fluoride ion selective electrode, conductivity meter and pH meter were used to
determine the fluoride content, conductivity, salinity, TDS and pH of the six naturally different
types of water, nine brands of tea prepared in deionized water, tap water and naturally fluoride
rich water whose origin from Ethiopia, Sri Lanka and China. The fluoride content, conductivity,
salinity, TDS and pH of six naturally different water ranged from 0.254-30.2 mg/L, 2.27-1706
μs, 0-0.9 %o, 48.7-838 mg/L and 7.73-8.59, respectively, infused fluoride, conductivity, salinity,
TDS and pH in nine brands of tea ranged from 50.8-2057 mg/kg, 414-2377 μs, 0.2-1.2 %o, 196-
1180 mg/L and 4.83-8.52, respectively, which were prepared in naturally different types of water
in different brewing time (3, 5 and 10 min) infusion. Even though, the fluoride level of tea
prepared in naturally fluoride rich water is high, one can reduce the daily intake of fluoride level
by taking tea rather than taking the naturally fluoride rich water itself.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The study area located in the two leather industries namely Addis Ababa leather industry
and ELICO-Awash Tannery. The Addis Ababa leather industry is located 18 km of
south-west of the Addis Ababa city, where as the ELICO-Awash tannery is located to the
Southern part of the city. The two industries were located to the riversides and their
leather processing wastes joins to the water systems. High tannery waste disposal,
channeling residual water mixes to the water system.
Water samples were collected from three sites of each leather industry for three days and
for three different times a day. Sample collection time was scheduled according to the
discharging time of the tannery process. The level of chromium species (Cr(III) and
Cr(VI)) were determined using two analytical methods. Total chromium concentration of
the water samples were determined by FAAS. The concentration of total chromium
varies significantly at the three different site of each of the two leather industries. There
was high concentration of chromium at the discharge point of Addis Ababa leather
industry than that of the Awash tannery. The same trends were also observed for the rest
of the sites. The level of chromium was also not the same when the result of the samples
collected at different time was observed.
The amount of Cr(VI) in the down streams of the two leather industries ranges from
0.01ppm to 0.15 ppm, which was not above the permissible level that is allowed to the
natural water.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
is modified with PEDOT and its
application for differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) detection of diazinon
,DZN ( organophosphate
pesticide) is observed. The PEDOT shows a
strong affinity toward diazinon molecule which
provides sensitivity for
the modified GCE. Instrumental and Chemical parameters influencing
the voltammetric response are optimized for
diazinon determination .
Under Optimum experimental condition the peak current is linear to
diazinon concentration over the range of 20μM to 80μM with a
correlation coefficient of 0.99866. The limit of detection based on three
times the standard deviation of the blank (3Sb) was 4.245x 10-6M.
The recovery values for sample tap-water solution containing low ,middle
and high concentration of diazinon (50μM,
60 μM &amp; 80 μM) were
95.24%,88.4% &amp; 81.29%; respectively. Thus this modified electrode is
considerably applied for the determination of DZN in tap-water sample.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The photoelectrochemical properties of a solid-state photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) based
on poly(3-octylthiophene), P3OT, and a blend of P3OT with phenyl-C61-butyric acid
methyl ester, PCBM, an ion-conducting polymer electrolyte, amorphous poly(ethylene
oxide), POMOE, complexed with iodine/triiodide redox couple has been constructed and
studied. The current - voltage characteristics in the dark and under white light illumination,
the dependence of the short - circuit (Isc) and the open - circuit voltage (Voc) of the two
types of the devices have been compared. An open-circuit voltage of 344 mV and a short-
circuit current of 0.47 μA cm-2 were obtained for the device of P3OT as a photoactive
electrode and an open-circuit voltage of 294 mV and a short-circuit current of 4.271 μA
cm-2 were obtained for the device of P3OT:PCBM at light intensity of 100 mW/cm2. The
transient photocurrent and photovoltage, the photocurrent action spectra of the blend
P3OT:PCBM for front and back side illuminations and an open-circuit voltage and short-
circuit current dependence on light intensity have been studied. During illumination, a
cathodic photocurrent was observed, indicating that the neutral poly(3-octylthiophene)
behaves as a p-type semiconductor. IPCE% of 0.0682 % for front side illumination
(ITO/PEDOT) and IPCE% of 0.0011 % for backside illumination (ITO/P3OT:PCBM) were
obtained for the device ITO│P3OT:PCBM │POMOE:I3-/I-│ PEDOT│ITO.</dc:description>

<dc:description>ABSTRACT
A new multidentate ligand (1, 10-PDOPD), with a 1, 10-phenanthroline
backbone was synthesized by the condensation reaction of 1, 10-
phenanthroline-5.6-dione (PD) and o-phenylenediamine (OPDA). Ni (II) and Zn
(II) complexes were synthesized by direct method. An alternative template
method was also applied for the synthesis of Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes using
the respective metal ions and the ligand precursors OPDA and PD with (mole
ratio 1:1). The 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, UV-Vis and elemental analysis were used for
the characterization of the ligand. The complexes were structurally studied
through AAS, UV-Vis, conductance and magnetic susceptibility measurements.
The magnetic susceptibility at RT of all Ni (II) complexes synthesized showed
the presence of two unpaired electrons for the metal ion. All complexes are
non-electrolytes in DMF solution. Octahedral geometries have been suggested
for each of the complexes.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>CHARACTERIZATION OF 4,4’-BIPYRIDINE</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>IONIC LIQUIDS</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Ionic liquids are salts with low melting points (&lt;100 0C). Since ionic liquids exhibit extremely
low vapor pressures, they do not release VOCs to the environment; and have positive impact on
ecological and environmental effect during synthesis and processing of chemicals. They provide
good solubility for a wide range of reactions, their design for use as solvents can serve both for
immobilization and coordinating ligands for the catalyst in processes involving homogeneous
catalysis. This can be addressed by synthesizing ionic liquids with functional groups that can
complex the metal centers. To this effect, they are called designer and eco-friendly solvents.
These interesting compounds are achieved either by incorporating a bulky, asymmetric N-
heterocyclic cation into the structure through quaternization process in order to preclude good
crystal packing and/or by selecting an anion in which there is considerable delocalization of the
electron cloud over the molecular backbone that tends to decrease interionic interaction,
example-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide.
Therefore the main objective of this project is to synthesize such important ionic liquids based on
4,4’-bipyridine heterocycles through quaternization with alkyl halides which are applicable in
homogeneous catalysis as solvents, solvent and ligand, and electrochemical uses in
electrodeposition.
As a result of this quaternization reaction monoalkylation has been successfully done in which
the products were confirmed by Spectroscopic techniques, analytical data (elemental analysis)
and different physical techniques having melting point of almost higher than 2000C. After
metathesis process the melting point of the prepared ILs have &lt;800C which fulfills the first
criteria to be true ILs with melting point of &lt;1000C.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ionic liquids are organic salts with melting point below 1000C. Their unique properties
such as negligible vapor pressure, wide ectrochemical window and solvent properties
have brought about an amazing interest in these salts. One of the most common research
areas based on ionic liquids as a solvent focuses on homogeneous catalysis since ionic
liquids are found to be ideal immobilizing agents for various classical transition metal
catalyst precursors. In the present study we have tried to synthesize new ionic liquids
based on phenanthroline taking in to account that it could easily dissolve transition metal
catalysts based on phenanthroline due to similar structure it possesses. In the present
work, new and monoalkylated salts based on phenanthroline, have been synthesized and
investigated. An attempt to dialkylate this salts failed due steric and electronic factors.
These Salts were characterized by various physical and spectroscopic techniques:
1
HNMR,
13
C NMR and elemental analysis their melting point, conductivity, miscibility
with water and organic solvents were determined. The influence of alkyl substituent
along with nature of the anion on the NMR chemical shift of the neighboring hydrogens
is also discussed. These compounds were also analyzed by melting point and factors such
as size of the anion, delocalization of the charge interaction between the ions and
disorder(asymmetry) in the cation affected the packing of the ionic liquid and thereby the
observed melting point.</dc:description>

mV/decade and detection limit of 6x10-7 M iodide. The application of the laboratory-made iodide
electrode (vs. a saturated calomel reference electrode) was investigated for direct potentiometric
titration of iodized salts and for potentiometric back titration of vitamin C in pharmaceutical
products and orange juices. The electrode was used as an endpoint indicator system in place of
the traditional starch-triiodide complex. Vitamin C with I3- was back titrated against Na2S2O3 in
acidic media while acidified samples of table salt iodized with iodate (in presence of excess
concentration of iodide) was directly titrated with Na2S2O3. The curves of both titrations
exhibited distinct endpoints down to 10 ppm as potassium iodate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Thiophene-phenylene-thiophene fused heteroarene ladder-type monomeric unit
which hinders “chain folding” and allows extended conjugation was synthesized
along with two variants of quinoxaline-based donor-acceptor monomeric units.
Subsequently the copolymerization between

these monomeric units and
2,2'-(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-
was
effected
by
a
modified
Suzuki
polymerization methodology. The copolymers were partially characterized using
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy in both thin film and as chloroform solution,
cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence spectroscopy, for their bandgap and
quantum yield. The results from the electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis
revealed a bandgap of 2.4, 2.1, and 1.9 eV for polymers 53, 54 and 55,
respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sugar fatty acid esters (SFAEs) are compounds produced from renewable and inexpensive
substances such as natural oils and glucose or starch. SFAEs are normally non-ionic, non-toxic,
non-irritants, odorless, tasteless and biodegradable. Due to these range of properties, these
compounds have found applications as diverse as surfactants in the food and cosmetic industries,
as insecticides and antimicrobial agents, in stabilizing and detergency or conditioning effects and
even as non-caloric fat substitutes. Changing the nature of the starting materials such as using
oils with special functional groups has the potential to provide with value-added products and
highly versatile materials with interesting characteristics. Vernonia galamensis is a plant,
endemic to Ethiopia, containing a very promising naturally epoxidized oil presenting also low
toxicity and inherent biodegradability. The synthesis of sugar fatty acid esters based on vernolic
fatty acids could provide with products with the potential to be used as a new type of epoxidized
surfactants or as starting materials for a variety of value added products. The chemical synthesis
of monosubstituted starch/glucose esters is very difficult to achieve due to the poor selectivity of
this approach. Enzymatic processes are an excellent alternative due to the high selectivity of the
reaction owing to their exquisite stereo-selectivity, regio-selectivity and functional group
specificity. In this work, the synthesis of starch/glucose vernolates has been attempted from
vernolic acid and methyl vernolate by enzymatic (candida antarctica lipase B) esterification in
the ionic liquid [Bmim][TfO]. The use of ionic liquid avoids the use of environmentally
unfriendly volatile organic liquids. The low vapour pressure exhibit by ionic liquids avoids the
use of molecular sieves as the water produced in the reaction can be continuously extracted
under vacuum. The synthetic procedure also includes the use of water mediated supersaturated
solutions that allowed us to increase the concentration of glucose in the ionic liquid media.
Moreover, the activity of the enzyme was found to be enhanced by the ionic liquid used. The
products were characterized by melting point and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and the degree
of substitution of the glucose ester was investigated and found to be 2.17.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is one of the most widely used spices that contain
several interesting bioactive constituents. Ginger has numerous health benefits and has
been reported to possess antioxidant, antiseptic, anticarcinogenic, and antifungal,
properties. In the present study, the level of essential (Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Co, Cr, Mn, and
Ni) and non-essential elements (Cd and Pb) in ginger cultivated in Ethiopia (particularly in
Tepi, Bombae, Hadaro and Ilubabur) and the soil where it has grown were determined by
flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The optimized wet digestion procedure was
evaluated using standard addition (spiking) method and an acceptable percentage recovery
was obtained 93-106 and 93-107 for the metals in ginger and soil samples respectively
except chromium in ginger. 0.5 g of oven dried ginger sample was digested using 3 mL of
HNO3 and 1 mL of HClO4 at 210 oC for 3 h and 0.5 g dried soil sample was digested with
reagent mixture of 6 mL aqua-regia and 1.5 mL H2O2 at 270 oC for 3 h. The mean metal
concentration ( g/g dry weight basis) ranges in ginger and soil samples respectively are:
Ca (2001-2543, 1773-3583), Mg (2700-4094, 1457-2442), Fe (41.8- 89.0, 21701-46950),
Zn (38.5-55.2, 255-412), Cu (1.1-4.8, 3.8-33.9), Co (2.0-7.6, 48.5-159), Cr (6.0-10.8, 110-
163), Mn (184-401, 1756-6465), Ni (5.6-8.4, 14.1-79.3) and Cd (0.38-0.97, 0.24-1.1).
However, Pb was not detected in both ginger and soil samples. A statistical analysis of
variance (ANOVA) at 95% confidence level was used to test whether the variation
between the mineral content of four sample means were significant or not. The Pearson
correlation was used to predict the dependence of metal levels on one another.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Abstract
Coordination compounds play vital roles in biology, biochemistry and medicine,
controlling the structure and function of many enzymes and their metabolism. They
find varied application in many industrial processes and in the development of new
materials with specifically designed properties. Thus, synthesis and study of the
complexes is very important. In this project work, equimolar quantities of ophenyldiamine
and ninhydrine were condensed to produce a quionoxline derivative
(NHOPD) which behaves as a bidentate ON donor ligand. The formation of
quionoxline derivative (NHOPD) was confirmed by 1HNMR. The ligand (NHOPD)
was further complexed with divalent Ni (II) and Co (II) metal salts. Metal complexes
of nickel and Cobalt with quionoxline (NHOPD) were prepared and characterized
by elemental analysis, conductance measurements, atomic absorption spectra, IR,
NMR and UV spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study, the concentration levels of major (Ca and Mg), trace (Fe, Zn, Cu,
Co, Cr, Mn, and Ni), and toxic (Cd and Pb) metals were determined in korarima
(Aframomum corrorima) samples collected from southern and southwestern
Ethiopia. The results were compared with the metal levels in the soil collected
from the same area as korarima sample. A wet digestion procedure involving the
use of 3 mL of HNO3 (69-72%) and 1 mL of HClO4 (70%) and modified aqua regia
(HCl:HNO3, 3:1) with hydrogen peroxide (6 mL of aqua regia and 1.5 mL of
H2O2) were used to solubilize metals from the korarima and soil samples,
respectively. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used to quantify the
metals levels. The validity of the procedure was checked by spiking experiments
and the recovery value ranges from 88 to 109% for korarima and from 89 to 104%
for soil samples. Calcium and iron were found to be the highest metals
determined in korarima and soil samples, respectively. Manganese is the most
accumulated trace metal in korarima seed samples analyzed and the second
most accumulated trace metal in the soil next to iron. The concentration of
cadmium was within the range 0.9-1 μg/g dry wt in korarima samples. The level
of lead in the korarima samples was below the method detection limit.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Coffee is an important commodity culturally, commercially and economically in the world. Because of its consumption in most countries in the world, it is important to investigate the exact amounts of its chemical constituents. Caffeine is one of the main components of coffee that affect the quality of coffee, both before and after processing. In this project, rapid, simple and sensitive quantitative thin-layer chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods for the quantification of caffeine in coffee, tea and soft drinks were developed and validated. The methods involved extracting samples with chloroform by sonication, and analysis by Camag TLC scanner 3 and quantitative proton NMR (qHNMR).
In the first method, Camag TLC scanner 3 was used for densitometric scanning and analysis in absorbance mode at 276 nm. The system was found to give a sharp peak for caffeine at Rf value of 0.64. The linear regression analysis data for calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r2 = 0.999 in the concentration range of 200-1600 ng spot-1 with respect to peak area. The method was validated for accuracy, precision and recovery.
In the qHNMR analysis, the method was based on 400 MHz proton NMR spectra of caffeine and theophylline (internal standard). Quantitative analyses were based on the integral ratio of selected signal belonging to the analyte with respect to that of an internal standard. The linear regression analysis data for calibration plots showed good relationship with r2 = 0.999 in the concentration range of 0.4-2.0 mg/mL with respect to peak area (integration). The recovery studies performed on pre-analyzed samples ranged between 97-108%.
The caffeine values in coffee, tea and soft drink samples, quantified by both methods, were found to be in agreement with those reported in the literature. Caffeine contents were found to be: in green and roasted coffees (0.8 - 1.1%), tea (1.9 - 2.1%), soft drinks (5 - 7 mg per 100 mL), machine-brewed coffees (80 - 103 mg per 150 mL) and home-brewed coffees (Ethiopian traditional style) 12 – 39 mg per 150 mL. Both methods can be recommended for routine analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Prussian Blue electrochemicaly modified onto a glassy carbon electrode surface to
prepare a chemically modified electrode which acts as a good electrocatalyst for the
reduction of hydrogen peroxide. This study was carried out using different pH ranges (3-
8) of 0.05M phosphate buffer solution. H2O2 was determined over range of 1 μM- 1 mM .
Different electroanalytic techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse and
square wave voltammetry were used. The result showed that the solution pH affects the
stability of the PB film. The cathodic peak current response for the reduction of 1mM
H2O2 at pH 8 decreased by 55.7 % compared to the response at pH 3.</dc:description>

<dc:title>THEORETICAL STUDIES OF NATURALLY OCCURING HOMOISOFLAVONOIDS GRADUATE PROJECT (Chem.774)</dc:title>

<dc:description>Abstract
Nowadays molecular modelling becomes an alternative way for sophisticated and costly experimental techniques. In this project the structures of five naturally occurring homoisoflavonoids namely; 5, 7-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3-(4’-hydroxybenzyl) chroman-4-one (A), 7-hydroxy-3-(4’-hydroxybenzyl) flavone (B), (E)-7-hydroxy-3-(4’-methoxybenzylidene) chroman-4-one (C), Brazilin (7, 11b-dihydrobenz[b]indeno [1, 2-d] pyran-3, 6a, 9, 10, (6H)-tetrol) (D) and 5, 7-hydroxy-3’, 4’-dimethoxyspiro {2H-1-benzopyran-3-bicyclo [4.2.0] octa [1’.3’.5’]-trien}-4-one (E) are determined by geometry optimization using Density Functional Theory. Comparison of optimized structural parameters like bond lengths, bond angles and torsional (dihedral) angles are extracted. Computation of molecular properties such as NMR shielding tensors (1H and 13C chemical shifts with respect to TMS), infrared harmonic vibrational frequency (scaled with 0.9614) and UV-absorption transitions of these natural homoisoflavonoids are reported here. Calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the experimentally observed values. Though IR absorption frequency spectra and UV absorption spectra were done in gas-phase, the obtained results are in good agreement with the experimental values.

<dc:subject>Alternating Copolymers</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Alternating polyfulorene copolymers, which have donor-acceptor-donor segments in
between the fluorene segments were synthesized and characterized. The donoracceptor-
donor monomers, namely, 5,8-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(3-(tert-butyl
dimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline and 5,8-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(3-(2-(2-
methoxyethoxy) ethoxy)phenyl)quinoxaline were prepared starting from 3-bromophenol
and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole. The polymers were synthesized by using Suzuki coupling
polymerization reaction. The resulting polymers showed good solubility in chloroform.
The electrochemical behaviors of the copolymers were characterized by cyclic
voltammetry. The synthesized compounds were characterized using spectroscopic
techniques.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Khat (Catha edulis Forsk) is a plant that grows in certain areas of East Africa and the Arab
Peninsula. A large number of people in Ethiopia chew khat leaves because of its pleasurable and
stimulating effects. In the present study the level of selected Trace metals ( Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Co,
Cr, Cd and Pb) in four different kinds of khat sampled from different khat shops in Adiss Abeba
were analyzed. Known weights of oven dried Khat samples were digested by wet digestion using
3 mL of HNO3 ,1 mL of HCLO4 and 1 mL of H2O2 by setting the temperature first to 60 0C for 30
min and then increased to 210 0C for the next 2 h and 30 min. The contents of the minerals in the
digests were analysed using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The following concentration
ranges in dry weight (μg/g) were obtained in the khat samples: Cu (19.2 - 24.4); Zn (24.1 – 46.9);
Mn (14.92 – 20.6); Ni (4.7 – 7.7); Co (3.1 – 7.76); Cr (3.1 – 6.76); Cd (1.3 – 2.9) and Pb (4.8 –
9.1). Among the essential metal analyted Zn was the most abundant one followed by Cu,Mn,and
Ni Whereas Co and Cr were less than Pb. Generally ‘Bahirdar’ Khat contained higher
concentration compared to Gelemso, Gurage and Wondo for the majority of the mineral nutrients
identified. The tested four kinds of khat proved high variability (p&lt;0.05) in their content of trace
metals. The possible uptake by the human body from fresh khat has also been determined. Except
Cd and Pb the amount of metal that one may take through consumption of fresh khat alone were
found to be below the recommended daily allowance</dc:description>

<dc:description>A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with electropolymerization of 4-Amino-3-
Hydroxynaphthalene-1-Sulphonic acid (AHNSA) in 0.1M HNO3 using cyclic voltammetry. The
modified electrode showed an excellent electrocatalytic effect on the redox property of Methyl
Parathion. The bare glassy carbon electrode could barely sense the 8 M concentration solution
of MPT. The modified electrode showed all the expected peaks from the MPT with high
sensitivity. After the optimization of Different parameters, analytical characterization of MPT
was made. The peak current increases linearly with the range of concentration of MPT used in
the analysis (0.2 M-1.6 M). The detection limit was 6.3 x 10-8M by square wave voltammetry.
The modified electrode has successfully been applied for the detection of MPT.</dc:description>

Advisor: Dr. Nigist Asfaw
Laggera tomentosa is a perennial fragrant bushy herb endemic plant of Ethiopia.
Chemical investigation on the ethanol extract of the leaves resulted in the
isolation of one sesquiterpene and two flavones namely, 3-(3’- acetoxy-2’-
hydroxy-2’-methyl butyryl)- cuauhtemone(LTE-3), 3’, 5, 6-trihydroxy -3, 4’, 7-
Trimethoxyflavone (LTE-5), 3’, 4’, 5, 7-tetrahydroxy -3, 6- dimethoxyflavone
(LTE-6). Of these LTE-3 and LTE-6 were not reported before to the best of our
knowledge. The structures of the isolated compounds were established by
spectroscopic techniques and chemical correlation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The contents of some selected metals Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Co and Cd in different thyme leaf samples readily consumed in Ethiopia were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) after acid digestion with 1:1 HNO3/HClO4 for 3 h at a temperature of 240 0C by a Kjeldahl apparatus hot plate digester. The level of the nutrients in the four samples ranged from 1239 – 2517 μg/g, Ca; 1524 – 1786 μg/g, Mg; 728 – 2517 μg/g, Fe; 37.7 – 114 μg/g, Mn; 8.7 – 52 μg/g, Zn; 9.83 – 14.2 μg/g, Ni; 7.69 – 9.3 μg/g, Cu; 2.59 – 4.3 μg/g, Co; and 0.87 – 1.3 μg/g, Cd; respectively. The concentration of Ca was higher than the other metals in the three samples and Cd was the least of all the metals in the analyzed samples. The over all reproducibility of the method obtained from spiking experiment was with in the range ± 10 % except for Fe (± 11.91 %), Cd (± 10.89 %) and Co (± 10.84 %). This result will complement available data on food composition in Ethiopia.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sampling, sample preparation and analysis methods based on supported liquid membrane
atrazine and ametryn and phenoxyacid herbicides; 2,4-D. In SLM extraction, neutral
herbicides could be extracted from a flowing aqueous solution to a stagnant acidic
acceptor solution for the two weakly basic s-triazines and to stagnant basic acceptor
solution for the weakly acidic phenoxyacid herbicide. Specifically, a liquid membrane
containing 0.1 mol/L sulphuric acid for the triazines and 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide for
the 2,4-D was suggested. The uncharged herbicide molecules from the flowing aqueous
donor solution diffused through a liquid membrane impregnated in a porous
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane, immobilized organic solvent, and then will be
trapped in a stagnant acceptor phase. The efficiency of the extraction process will be
found to depend on the donor solution pH, the amount of the mobile carrier added to the
liquid membrane and the concentration of the counter ion in the acceptor solution. From detailed studies, the optimum values of these parameters for the efficient extraction of the
herbicides will be determined. The applicability of the method for (SLM) have been
proposed for selective extraction of two s-triazine herbicides, namely extraction of these
selected herbicides at different stages of production of sugar will be also investigated by
spiking analyte sample solutions in sugar-cane juice, syrups, and molasses and sugar
crystal samples. The suggested method will be utilized for trace enrichment of the
analytes from samples containing matrices of various types and concentrations. A 20
minutes of sample enrichment at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, was suggested to determine
the concentrations of atrazine, ametryn and 2,4-D in sugar samples at various stages of
production.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Abstract
A solid-state iodide selective electrode with Ag2S-AgI adsorbed on graphite rod, recovered from a
dry cell, was prepared and validated for its typical response characteristics with an objective to
develop a potentiometric titration system for rapid measurements of Lamuvidine (LMV) in
tablets used as an antiretroviral drug for Hepatis B and HIV patients. The partial validation
exhibited typical response values of linear range of 10-6 to 10-1 M iodide and a slope
57.57 mV/decade which reasonably agreed with early data from this Laboratory. The basis of
LMV determination is its oxidation by excess bromine generated from bromate-bromide mixture.
The unreacted bromine oxidized the added excess iodide to iodine. The amount of bromine
consumed by LMV, the basis of its determination, was determined by subtracting the back-titrated
iodine with thiosulphate whose end-point was located potentiometrically with the solid state iodide
selective electrode against a reference electrode. The iodometric back titration provided for the
indirect determination of 1-30 mg LMV in turbid tablet test solutions. There was no interference
from the excipients in the tablet and this provided for LMV assays with and without filtration of
the turbid (insoluble) pharmaceutical excipients. Acid concentrations between 0.2 – 1.5 M HCl
did not have any influence on the titration end-points. The intra-day and inter-day variation of the
result was not significant. The system recovery for standard added sample was 99.3 ± 5.3 % and
for a reference LMV was 98.4 ± 0.8 %. For quality control checks, the potentiometric backtitration
method was favorably compared with an independently applied reference test method (UV
spectrophotometry at 280 nm), by quantitating LMV in a blind sample and reference drug material.
This inexpensive potentiometric titration system was easy to operate and exhibited good recovery
for LMV determinations in the typical drug dose labeled to contain 150 mg per tablet.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A simple sample preparation technique using a hollow fiber membrane in conjunction with high
performance liquid chromatography has been developed for the extraction and determination of
s-triazine herbicides and their major metabolites from environmental water and human urine
samples. Optimum extraction conditions have been evaluated with respect to solvent type,
acceptor and sample pH, extraction time, shaking speed and salt content as well as humic acid
effect. The extraction method has been validated for matrices such as reagent water, tap water,
river water and human urine samples, indicating that regent water can be selected as
representative matrix for routine analysis of these environmental water samples and human
urine samples. A high level of detection linearity with regression coefficients (r2) ranged from
0.994 to 0.999 was obtained for herbicides over a range of analyte concentrations between 50
and 100 μg/L, using peak area as a response variable. The repeatability and reproducibility of
the method were less than 11 and 17% for concentration of 50 μg/L, respectively. Limits of
detection of the method ranged from 0.03 to 1.12 μg/L and the limits of quantification from 0.10
to 3.73 μg/L, which were low enough to determine all the herbicides residues except
desisopropylatrazine at concentrations below or equal to the maximum residue levels (MRLs)
specified by European Union. The method was finally applied to the determination of the
herbicides in tap water, river water and human urine samples and the concentrations found in
these samples were always lower than the MRLs except desisopropylatrazine in tap water.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Electrochemical oxidation of catechol has been studied in the presence of imidazole as
nucleophile in aqueous solution, using cyclic voltammetry. The results indicate the
participation of catechol in 1, 4- Michael reaction with imidazole to form the corresponding
catechol thioethers. Based on the observed EC mechanism, the homogeneous rate constants
(kfcal) of the reaction of o-benzoquinone with imidazole were estimated by fitting the
theoretical working curve with the experimental working curve.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The electrochemical growth current of poly (1, 8- Diaminonaphthalene) and polypyrrole and
their redox currents were enhanced several-fold when deposited on carbon nanotubes
modified glassy carbon electrode compared the bare glassy carbon electrode surface. Cyclic
voltammetry were used to characterize the modified film on the electrode surface. The
electrocatalytic ability of the modified electrodes for the reduction of molecular oxygen was
investigated using cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk techniques in 0.2 M NaSO 4 (pH=1)
solution. GC/MWCNT/p-DAN modified electrode showed good electrocatalytic activity for
oxygen reduction reaction. The oxygen reduction behavior of GC/MWCNT/p-DAN electrode
at different deposition cycle (5 and 8) of p-DAN was investigated using rotating disk
electrodes and compared with each other. The RDE data indicated that the reduction of
oxygen on both electrodes of GC/MWCNT/p-DAN proceeds by four-electron pathway in 0.2
M NaSO4 (pH=1) solution. From Koutecky-Levich analysis, the kinetics parameters (total
number of exchanged electrons, limiting current, rate constant, exchange current, Tafel slope
and transfer coefficient) were determined.</dc:description>

donor monomers, namely, 5,8-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(3-(tert-butyl
dimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline and 5,8-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(3-(2-(2-
methoxyethoxy) ethoxy)phenyl)quinoxaline were prepared starting from 3-bromophenol
and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole. The polymers were synthesized by using Suzuki coupling
polymerization reaction. The resulting polymers showed good solubility in chloroform.
The electrochemical behaviors of the copolymers were characterized by cyclic
voltammetry. The synthesized compounds were characterized using spectroscopic
techniques.</dc:description>

has not been conducted so far. Thus, this study has assessed the level of essential (Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, Cu and Zn) and non-essential elements (Cd and Pb) of R. prinoides leaves and stems
cultivated in Ethiopia using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. The solutions for the analysis
of the metals in leaf and stem mentioned above were prepared by the carefully optimized mixture
of HNO3, H2O2 and HClO4 reagents using wet digestion with a reflux condenser. The efficiency of
the optimized procedure was validated by spiking experiment and the percent of recovery for all
the metals was (92-103 for leaf samples and 91-103 for the stem samples). The concentrations of
all the metals mentioned above were analyzed and the concentrations were reported in (mg/kg)
except the concentration of chromium at Simche zala in stem sample, the concentrations of
cadmium in stem samples at two sample sites (Kesatyebirhan ,Gedga Amba and Migra) and the
concentrations of lead in stem at all sample sites were below the method detection limit and hence
were not reported. The concentrations of the metals found were: Mg (3202–4622), Ca (6304–
22236), Cd (0.81–3.10), Cr (5.10–18.7), Mn (8.12–20.6), Fe (47.9–187), Co (22.2–42.1), Ni (12.8–
27.3), Cu (6.5–73.0), Zn (12.2–43), Pb (17.7–25.0) in leaf samples and Mg (2635–5528), Ca
(3601–5675), Cd (1.00–1.56), Cr (5.42–16.3), Mn (2.16–3.82), Fe (22.0–124), Co (18.7–91.7), Ni
(9.68–19.2), Cu (16.6–233) and Zn (17.4–28.2) in stem samples.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An attempt was made to develop perchlorate-selective coated graphite electrode based on
crystal violet using 1-chloronaphthalene as plasticizer. The electrode prepared by coating crystal
violet-perchlorate ion association in 1-chloronaphthalene both as the plasticizer and the solvent
with a PVC matrix on a graphite rod was found to give a Nernstian response to perchlorate in a
wide concentration range. Proper response of the electrode was observed in test solutions made
in 0.1 moleL-1 potassium nitrate solution. The linear range, slope, and detection limit from the
plot of E vs log [ClO4-] were found to be 1.0 x 10-5-1.0 x 10-1 mol L-1, 58±1.5 mV/decade and
3.16 x 10-6 mole L-1 perchlorate respectively. The electrode was also used to detect periodate
with linear range, slope and detection limit of 1.0 x 10-4-1.0 x 10-2 mol L-1, 57±1.5 mV/decade
and 5.7 x 10-5 mole L-1 periodate respectively. The response time of the electrode was found to
be &lt; 20 s for concentrations higher than 1.0 x 10-4 M and the electrode functioned properly for
four weeks. The effect of the amount of the electroactive ion pair was also studied and it was
found that electrode prepared from 20-30 mg of the crystal violet perchlorate was chosen with
the best response. The effects of diverse ions on the electrode response to perchlorate were
studied and the potentiometric selectivity coefficients were evaluated. The electrode was found
to be highly selective to perchlorate and periodate. The analytical application of the electrode
was extended to the direct determination of perchlorate and periodate and to the indirect
determination of ethylene glycol, glycerol, glucose and mannitol via periodate oxidation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The occurrence of dental and skeletal fluorosis among the population in the Ethiopian
Rift Valley provided the motivation to investigate occurrence of fluoride in soil and
water. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of fluoride in Ethiopian Rift
Valley soils and the nearby irrigation water sources and the correlation of fluoride with
metals. Nine soil samples from the surface horizon (0-20 cm) depth and water samples
were collected from high fluoride zone of Ethiopian Rift Valley and one controlling
group collected from the College of Natural Sciences (Arat Killo Campus), Addis Ababa
University. The sample was collected by random sampling technique. The soil samples
were air dried, grinded, sieved and weighed, then measured for both fluoride and metals
content. The pH, conductivity, salinity and total dissolved solid in water and soil sample
were also measured. Fluoride determination was made by fluoride ion selective electrode
and metal determination by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The validation
of optimized procedure was evaluated using standard addition (spiking) method and an
acceptable percentage recovery was obtained. The fluoride concentration in water sample
was found in the range of 0.143-8.03 mg/L which are below the WHO limits of fluoride
concentration for irrigation (less than 10 mg/L). The water soluble and total fluorides in
soil were 2.32-16.2 μg/g and 209-1210 μg/g, respectively. The mean metal concentration
(μg/g dry weight basis) range in soil samples and mg/L in water samples respectively
were: Na (684-6703, 8.64-67.3), Mg (1608-11229, 22.7-66.7), K (1776-4394, 1.11-20.3),
Ca (7547-22998, 16.7-267), Cr (9.79-79.3, 0.071-0.169), Mn (143-700, 0.048-37.2), Co
(50.3-112, 0.354-1.48), Ni (446-1288, 0.274-40.9), Fe (12180-32681, 6.04-47.7), Cu
(8.85-45.4, 0.088-0.251) and Zn (30.5-89.2, 0.144-0.562). Fluoride was found to have
significant correlation with major metals (Fe, Cu and Cr), but the correlation with other
trace metals were not significant.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The ionic liquid field has been extensively dominated by imidazolium salts with anions most
frequently being fluorine-containing. By modifying the anion or the fluorine containing cation, a
wide range of properties can be tuned. Ionic liquids with fluorine-containing groups in the
cation are promising solvents for electrochemical, photovoltaic, surfactant and synthetic
applications. Previously, 1-methyl-3-triflouroacetyl imidazolium trifluoroacetate ionic liquid
was synthesised but with high melting point. Following this synthesis, in the present study, a
triflouroacetylated imidazole based ionic liquid with longer alkyl chain; 1-pentyl-3-
triflouroacetyl imidazolium based ionic liquid was synthesized by alkylation of imidazole
followed by triflouroacetylation and resulted in a viscous solid. The ionic liquid was
characterized by NMR. In the second trial, the same procedure was repeated increasing the
reaction time and the crude product was distilled under vacuum and yielded a new crystalline
hydroxide anion based 1-pentyl-3-triflouroacetyl imidazolium ionic liquid. This result was
evident from NMR characterization and elemental analysis. This ionic liquid was soluble in
water and in most of organic solvents and was found to be highly hygroscopic and an electrolyte.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This paper presents the concentration of K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Co, Cr, Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, and
Mn in Enset ventricosum. Samples of enset were collected from Wolliso (Oromiya
region) and Wolkite (SNNPRG) in March 2006. Total acid (4 mL mixture of HNO3 and
HClO4) digestion method was employed and determination was made by flame atomic
absorption spectrometry. The percentage recoveries of the metals were in the range of
85% to 120%. The ranges of the concentrations (μg/g) of the metals on dry weight basis
are: Ca 36,100 – 39,100; Mg 24,900 – 26,900; K 14,100 – 32,200; Zn 11.9 – 42.3; Cu 1.5
– 5.2, Co 2.8 – 10.5; Cr 5.8 – 7.6; Fe 18.2 – 54.4; Mn 2 _ 5; Ni 1 – 4 and Cd 0.6 _ 1.8..
The result obtained implies the plant is rich in calcium, magnesium and potassium and
has small concentration of non-essential trace elements.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Novel Schiff base mixed ligand complexes of Cu(II) and Zn(II) were prepared from 3-AC and
4-AR by template synthesis. Also, new metal complexes of chromium(III), iron(III) and
copper(II) ions were synthesized with 4-AR. All the complexes were characterized by elemental
and metal ion analyses, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility data and
conductance measurements.
Analytical data of the mixed ligand complexes shows a M:L ratio of 1:2 and 1:1 for copper and
zinc complexes, respectively. Based on these data, an octahedral geometry for Cu(II) complex
and a tetrahedral geometry for the Zn(II) complex was proposed. In the Cu(II) complex, the
mixed ligand acts as an O,N donor and in the Zn(II) complex, it acts as an O,N,O donor. Attempt
to synthesize the mixed ligand complexes with Cr(III), Fe(III) and Ni(II) ions were not
successful.
Complexation of chromium(III), iron(III) and copper(II) ions were carried out with 4-AR
successfully. The ligand coordinates through the phenolic oxygen and the carbonyl oxygen
atoms (i.e. the ligand behaves as O,O donor). An octahedral geometry for Cr(III) and Fe(III)
complexes and a tetrahedral geometry for the Cu(II) complex was proposed. Attempt to
synthesize the Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes with 4-AR were not successful.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) is native to Ethiopia. It is a plant mostly used
as a spice and herbal medicine in most countries of the world. Fenugreek has many
dietary and health benefits. It is used as anti-diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, anti-cancer,
anti-microbial, against breast cancer, hypoglycemia, antioxidation, laxation, apetite
stimulation, antiulcer, and immunomodulatory, spice in food, etc. In this study, the levels
of major (Ca, K, Na, Mg), trace (Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn, Mn, Cu, Co), and toxic (Pb, Cd) metals
in seed of fenugreek grown in different regions of Ethiopia were determined by flame
atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS). Wet ashing was used to digest 0.5 g
fenugreek seed flour and was optimized using 1.5 mL of HNO3 and HClO4 acid mixtures
(5:1 ratio), 30 min pre-digestion time, 45 min total digestion time and 150 0C
temperature. Thirteen elements were analyzes and their concentrations are listed in the
following ranges and order; Ca (15353–36771 mg/kg) &gt; Fe (6041–18584 mg/kg) &gt; K

<dc:description>A family of conjugated polymers based on 9,9-disubstituted fluorenes and
cyanovinylenes were reported. The polymers were synthesized by employing a slightly
modified Suzuki coupling polymerization reaction and condensation polymerization
utilizing the Knoevenagel reaction. The resulting polymers showed good solubility in
chloroform. The energetic positions of the band edges were determined by cyclic
voltammetry. The synthesized polymers were characterized by using spectroscopic
techniques such as UV-Vis and 1H- NMR. The presented polymers exhibited emission
of blue to red colors</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study reliable and simple electrochemical method has been proposed for the simultaneous determination of paracetamol and para-amonophenol in pharmaceutical formulations. The oxidation and reduction peak potentials in of APAP at PEDOT/GC occurred at 381 and 353.65 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively at pH 7.0, while those for PAP at PEDOT/GC appeared at 127 mV and 92 mV, respectively. In comparison to bare glassy carbon, the apparent reversibility and potential shift of the electrochemical reactions of APAP and PAP were significantly improved at PEDOT/GC. A peak separation of about 257.48 mV was observed while running the differential pulse voltammogram of APAP and PAP. This allows for the simultaneous determination of APAP and PAP in tablets. The linear range were found to be 1-100 μM for APAP and 4-320 μM for PAP with the detection limits of 0.4048 μM and 1.1880 μM (calculated by 3σ/m) respectively.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A novel stripping square wave voltammetric method has been developed for the determination
of uric acid (UA) in untreated human urine using iron (III) doped zeolite/graphite powder
composite modified GCE. The synergetic effects of the catalytic role of Fe3+, larger surface area
of zeolite, and higher conductivity of graphite powder account for the anodic peak current
obtained at much lower positive oxidation potential than at the bare GCE. The proposed method
is simple, rapid, has excellent selectivity, reproducible and sensitive in the linear range of 2–80
μM UA with a detection limit of 2.3 x 10-7 mol L-1. The developed method enabled to achieve
recoveries ranging from 90.98 to 106.77% of spiked standard UA from untreated human urine
with a standard error of less than unity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The steady state absorption, fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of 2, 2′- biquinoline
have been studied in polar and non-polar solvents. Absorption spectra are almost independent of
solvent polarity. The dependence of fluorescence emission on excitation wavelength was
observed in acetonitrile, dichloromethane and p-dioxane but independent of excitation energy in
cyclohexane. Addition of metal ion and varying pH of the solution shifted the absorption and
excitation band to the red-edge. Corresponding excitation bands of the metal free conformers
were compared to the stable conformers of metal-chelated and protonated 2,2′- biquinoline.
Study of the rotational profile of 2, 2′- biquinoline at semi-empirical of INDO methods shows
two energy minima corresponding to two conformations of different energy, cis/trans structures,
with barrier to rotation comparable for trans to the room temperature thermal energy but less for
cis conformer. It is shown that distributions of energetically different conformers of the molecule
(cis/trans) in the ground state are responsible for the dual fluorescence behavior of the systems.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Herein, the optical metal ion sensing properties of monomers (M1 and M2) containing imidazole
group as molecular recognition units and conjugated polymer (P1) carrying thiophine and
thiazole in their backbone were studied. Absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the
materials considered were not significantly changed in different solvents. Sensing ability of the
monomers and the polymer solutions to metal ions was carried out using fluorescence
spectrometer. Both monomers were highly selective and sensitive optical chemosensor only to
Fe3+ ion in THF, chloroform, and dioxane. The sensing principle was based on fluorescence
quenching by forming complex between Fe3+ and imidazole group in the monomers backbone.
The limit of detection values (LOD) for M1 and M2 in THF were 1.386x10-5 mol/L and
3.902x10-6 mol/L, respectively. Moreover, LOD values for M1 and M2 in chloroform obtained
were 1.315x10-5 mol/L and 3.707x10-5 mol/L, respectively. The sensitivity of the monomers
towards Fe3+ ion was compared by calculating Stern-Volumer constant (Ksv). The Ksv values
found for M1 and M2 in THF were 6.474x102 M-1 and 1.495x103 M-1, respectively, and in
chloroform the Ksv values obtained for M1 and M2 were 3.928x102 M-1 and 5.535x102 M-1,
respectively. Results obtained showed that monomer M2 was more sensitive than M1 towards
Fe3+ in all solvents considered. The fluorescence spectra of conjugated polymer P1 in THF,
toluene, chloroform, and dioxane was insensitive to all metal ions considered.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts with melting points below 100oC and have remarkable and designer
flexible physicochemical properties that offer distinctive performance advantages in a variety of
synthetic, catalytic, and electrochemical applications. They are widely used as green alternatives
to conventional environment polluting volatile organic solvents (VOCs) due to their negligible
vapor pressure. However, their application in areas like catalysis is limited by the limited number
of cations on which the majority of ILs in common use is based and due to the low solubilities of
organometallic compounds in these groups of ILs. Their green credentials are also being put into
question as the interest in ILs increases. Hence designing new ILs for a given application should
also be accompanied by improvements in the methodology of their preparation with respect to
economics of preparation, environmental impact and cumulative energy demand (CED). In a
current work done in our laboratory, [CnPhen]X (X= Br-, PF6
-, Tf2N-) ILs have been synthesized
following a similar procedure to commonly used ILs and they exhibited good solubilities for
phenanthroline and phenanthroline - metal complexes. Tetrafluoroborate ILs normally exhibit
low melting points and low coordinating abilities that are desired for catalytic reactions. For this
study, we have synthesized a range of new [CnPhen]BF4 ILs with varying alkyl chains. Even
though, the new water miscible [CnPhen]BF4 ILs could be synthesized according to the
conventional procedure for the synthesis of other water miscible BF4
- containing ILs, we
developed a new simple anion metathesis procedure, which has cut down reaction times,
improved yields and bypassed the difficult by-product separation and product purification steps.
[CnPhen]BF4 ILs exhibited good solubilities for phenanthroline and a wide range of
phenanthroline based metal complexes. Their melting points were found to be relatively lower
than its halides, PF6
- and some of Tf2N- containing analogues and followed the same trend with
alkyl chain length of the cation as its [CnPhen]Br precursor. Furthermore, these ILs are found to
be soluble in a larger number of organic solvents than their analogous salts, which offer
flexibility for application in a number of reaction and catalysis schemes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Supported liquid membrane (SLM) was optimized for extraction of selected triazine herbicides at microgram level in different type of agro-processed fruit juices and home-made Tej samples prior to HPLC-UV analysis. By appropriate optimization of the SLM parameters, the extraction efficiency and enrichment factor of these herbicides can be improved with good repeatability of the results. For samples spiked at 100 μg L-1 the detection limit ranges from 2.61 μg L-1 for ametryn in Tej to 12.32 μg L-1 for terbutryn in orange juice. The optimized SLM extraction method was linear in pineapple juice at concentration range of 50 μg L-1- 500 μg L-1 with correlation factors greater than 0.99 and average % RSDs less than 5.50% for triplicate analysis. The method was highly selective towards the selected triazine herbicides in all the sample matrices considered, showing no interfering peaks at the retention times of the target analytes and giving well resolved chromatographic peaks. The results suggest that SLM extraction is an alternative method for trace enrichment of wide variety of pesticides from liquid and semi-liquid matrices and could be used as a routine method for trace extraction and enrichment of pesticides from such matrices.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The genus vernonia is one of the largest groups in the family Asteraceae and includes more than
1000 species distributed widely in tropical and sub tropical regions of Africa, Asia and America.
Vernonia galamensis is a new potential industrial oil seed crop for semiarid areas with very high
content of naturally epoxidized vernolic acid (80% of the oil). The epoxy oil of this seed also
contains linoleic acid (12% to14%), oleic acid (4% to 6 %), stearic acid (2% to 3%), palmitic acid
(2% to 3%) and a trace amount of arachidic acid.
The dichloromethane and methanol extracts of the seed of vernonia galamensis afforded VG-3 and
VG-4A respectively. The structural elucidation of these compounds was determined based on IR,
UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC and HMBC) spectra. Moreover, the literature
values of selected 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of methyl vernolate are matched with 1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra of VG-3 and VG-4A</dc:description>

<dc:description>The electrochemical behaviour of the complex between L-ascorbic acid (AA) and Pb (II) was studied by using Square-wave voltammetry (SWV) and Cyclic voltammetry (CV). L-ascorbic acid forms a 1:1 complex with Pb (II) in 0.1 M sodium perchlorate at pH 5.0. It was found that the reduction processes of Pb (II)-ascorbic acid complex was irreversible. The stability constant of the Pb (II) - ascorbate complexes were evaluated with the De Ford-Hume procedure at different ligand concentrations using square wave voltammetry (SWV). The logarithm values of stability constant of 1:1 Pb (II)-ascorbic acid complex was found to be 0.908.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Trace mineral content and some quality parameters (physicochemical properties) such as pH, electrical conductivity and ash content of honey were determined using FAAS, pH- meter, conductivity meter and furnace, respectively. Fe was found in highest amount with mean concentration ranging from 5.37 to 12.43 μg/g followed by Ni with mean concentration range of 0.8 to 4.46 μg/g, Cr (1.20-4.33 μg/g), Zn (1.92-4.22 μg/g), Co (0.60-1.17 μg/g), Cd (ND-0.69 μg/g), Mn (0.16-0.885 μg/g) and Cu (0.09-0.4676 μg/g). The non-essential metal Pb was not detected. Similarly, the ranges of physicochemical properties analyzed could be summarized as: pH 4.11-4.33, ash content 0.17-0.46 % and electrical conductivity of 0.10-0.29. The metals content and the physicochemical properties investigated in honey samples were found within the ranges established by national and international standards. The quality of some samples of honey was evaluated from the point of view of physicochemical properties and content of trace metals. The optimized wet digestion method for honey analysis was found efficient for the metals analyzed and it was validated through the recovery experiment and a good percentage recovery was obtained (93-104%).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Computational study was performed on a hydrogen bonded complex formed by antyridone and 2,6-diaminopyridine-3,5-dialdehyde. Six other complexes were designed based on the structure of the complex by changing the R- group of monomer A in to C6H5, p-toluene, p-phenol, OH and OCH3, the X group of monomer B in to chlorine. The binding energies of the complexes were calculated based on their optimized geometry using DFT/B3LYP at 6-31 G level. The electronic spectra for the complexes were calculated with ZINDO and IR spectra of the monomers and complex 1 were computed using DFT/B3LYP at 6-31 G level. It was indicated that all complexes could be formed, via hydrogen bonds. Complexes 2 - 4 were hindered due to steric effect. Electron donating nature was the stability factor. The first absorptions in the electronic spectra of the complexes were red shifted compared with those of the monomers. The stretching vibrations of the N – H bonds were increased with the formation of the hydrogen bond.</dc:description>

<dc:description>ABSTRACT
The ability of lateritic soils to remove fluoride from water was studied to clarify some basic issues a) is there a
correlation between the mineral composition of the soils and their ability to remove fluoride? b) which processes
account for the fluoride removal? c) is the fluoride removal ability increased by a thermal treatment of the soils?
and d) which kind of fluoride containing species remain in the soil treated water? The results obtained indicate
that fluoride removal and gibbsite content of the soils are correlated. From this it can be concluded that gibbsite
is the active component in lateritic soils in the fluoride removal. Speciation analysis reveals that at low free
fluoride concentrations the dissolution of gibbsite facilitated by the adsorption of fluoride onto gibbsite
accompanied by the formation of aluminum fluoro complexes can explain the mechanism of fluoride removal.
The question to which extent the exchange of hydroxide ion with fluoride ion in gibbsite takes place in the
defluoridation process cannot be answered with certainty. The electrochemical investigations of aluminum
electrodes by cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and potentiometry have shown that passivation of the
aluminum electrodes is a drawback of the defluoridation of low fluoride solutions by electrochemically generated
Al(OH)3 but it might be possible at higher fluoride concentrations.
Key words: Fluoride removal, lateritic soils, speciation analysis, complexed fluoride,
Alzheimer’s disease, electrochemical behaviors, passivation, votammogram,
impedance spectroscopy, removal capacity and adsorption isotherm.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Abstract
. Complexes of Co(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) with Ruhmann’s purple, those of Fe(III) and Mn(II) with an
intermediate Schiff base ( ketimine and / or aldimine) and Cu(II) with ninhydrin were successfully
synthesized. All complexes were distinctly colored and stable to atmospheric conditions. The
complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility,
infrared and electronic spectral studies.
The ligands were shown to behave as a monobasic tridentate ONO, bidentate ON or OO donor.
The complexes of Zn(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) are purely Ruhmann’s purple, those of Mn(II) and
Fe(III) are Schiff base (ketimine), Schiff base and ninhydrin or Schiff base and Ruhmann’s purple
complexes. An octahedral geometry is proposed for all of the metal complexes, except Mn(II).
A comparative anti- microbial study of the complexes was undertaken against two gram - negative
bacteria, Escherichia coli and one gram - positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. It was
revealed that except Cu(II) and to some extent Zn(II) complexes most of the complexes exhibit a
reduced activity against both bacterium.

<dc:description>Abstract
In this project two ligands 2,4,6-tris(hydroxylamino)-s-triazine (THASTZ) and 2,4,6-
tris (hydrazino)-s-triazine (THSTZ) were synthesized.
Suspension of THASTZ in methanol and THSTZ in acetonitrile was used to synthesize
metal complexes of VO(II), Ag(I), Cu(I), Cd(II) and Hg(II) They have been
characterized on the basis of analytical, thermal (DSC-TGA), magnetic susceptibility,
conductance, IR, NMR, UV-VIS spectral studies. The conductivity measurement studies
show that the metal complexes are non-electrolytes and the chlorides (no chlorides in
Ag (I) and VO (II) complexes) are coordinated in the inner sphere of the metal
complexes. Except in DMSO both ligands (THASTZ and THSTZ) are insoluble in most
common solvents unless heated. For both ligands (except for Ag (I) complex, which is
3:1 ratio) the metal to ligand ratio in the complexes is 1:1. The data shows that Hg (II)
and Cd (II) complexes form octahedral while VO (II) form distorted octahedral
complexes, where as Ag (I) and Cu (I) show tetrahedral geometry.
All data have confirmed the formation of THASTZ, THSTZ and their corresponding
metal complexes. Antimicrobial activity tests against salmonella typhi and staphlococus
aureus of THASTZ, THSTZ and their corresponding metal complexes have been
investigated. The result shows that 2,4,6-tris (hydrazino)-s-triazine was found inactive
against salmonella typhi; where as 2,4,6-tris (hydroxyl amino)-s-triazine was inactive against both bacteria. Metal complexes of both THSTZ and THASTZ have varied
inhibition activities diameter against both bacteria.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this study the template synthesis and characterization of two new series of Zn(II), Co(II),
and Cu(II) metal complexes of polyaza macrocyclic ligands are presented.
In the first part of this work template condensation reaction of o-phenylenediamine with
succinic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio in the presence of divalent transition metal ions [Zn(II),
Co(II) and Cu(II)], led to the formation of new series of polycrystalline macrocyclic
complexes. The synthesis is a remarkably facile one requiring only stirring under room
temperature for short period of time. Elemental analysis shows that the complexes have a 1:1
ligand to metal stoichiometry. The absence of bands characteristic of primary amines and
carboxylic acids functional groups and the presence of bands characteristic of coordinated
secondary amine in the N-H and M-N region gave a strong evidence for the formation of the
proposed metal complexes. The 1H and the 13C NMR spectra for Zn(II) complex from the first
series also confirm the formation of the macrocyclic frame work. The coordination geometry
is found to be octahedral for the Zn(II) and Co(II) complexes and square planar for the Co(II)
complex.
In the second part of the work, template condensation reaction of p-phenylenediamine,
ethyelenediamine, formaldehyde and succinic acid in the presence of metal ions [Zn(II),
Co(II) and Cu(II)] produced metal complexes of octahedral geometry of bis(macrocycles)
framework. The formation of such series of complexes was confirmed by physico-chemical
studies such as elemental analysis for the metal and chlorine, infrared spectroscopy, electronic
spectral studies and conductivity data.
Lastly, preliminary investigation on the potential hydrolytic nature of the Zn(II) metal
complexes revealed that the complexes possess no significant catalytic nature in the
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and carboxylate ester. This is probably due to the
presence of elctrophilic carbonyl carbon site on the macocycles of the complex that compete
for Zn-OH- nucleophile and thereby deactivating its catalytic activity and the formation of
polymeric hydroxide precipitate of the complexes at higher pH.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the present work, physico-chemical variables (temperatures, pH, TDS, and conductivity) and
some selected trace metals (Cd, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb, and Zn) analysis of the water and surface
sediments from river Big Akaki and Little Akaki were conducted with a view to asses the quality
of the rivers as well as to identify the potential contaminated areas. The results of physicochemical
parameters revealed that the mean values of temperature reading, pH, conductivity, and
TDS along LAR varied between 19 to 21 oC, 6.59 to 7.71, 661 to 1790 μS/cm and 317 to 881
mg/L, respectively and the ranges of these values along BAR are 17 to 21 oC, 369 to 749 μS/cm,
176 to 316 mg/L. Trends of these variables showed an intimate relation with anthropogenic
activities along both rivers. Trace metals in sediment and water samples were determined by
FAAS. The levels of dissolved trace metals in these rivers were found to be below the detections
limit of the method except for Zn and indeed Ni and Co in some sampling sites of the rivers. The
levels of dissolved metals in both rivers are below the South Africa guidelines fixed for
irrigational, domestic and livestock watering purposes. In contrast to water samples significant
amount of metals were found in both river sediment samples at all sampling stations. The
concentration ranges of the metals in LAR sediments were: 0.43 to 1.45,30 to 89, 18.32 to 44.02,
119 to 73, 55.73 to 320, and 205 to 730 mg/L for Cd, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb, and Zn, respectively also the
mean range of these metals in BAR sediments are 0.31 to 0.59, 30.5 to 89.41, 18.33 to 30.47, 119
to 62, 35.67 to 71.75, 172.89 to 288 mg/L, respectively. Levels of Cd and Co were found to be low
in both river sediments and they are below EPA sediment quality guidelines (SQG). Cu in both
river sediments was found to be below SQG except at one site along LAR. Both rivers sediments
were found to be enriched with Ni and all sampling sites of LAR and 80% of BAR sites surpassed SQG for Ni. The levels of Zn and Pb along BAR sediments are below SQG while 30% of sites
along LAR contain Pb above SQG and one site along LAR surpassed the SQG for Zn content.
Pair wise comparison of the two rivers revealed that generally the levels of trace metals and the
values of physico-chemical variables in LAR are higher than that of BAR. The levels of Cd, Pb
and Zn in the sediments of LAR showed a significant positive correlation with each other.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Maize and Sorghum are the major staple food crops in the tropics. Of many insects that attack
these crops Chilo partellus (Swinehoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is the most notorious
species. Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a co-evolved parasitoid of
C. partellus and has been utilized as a biological control of stemborers including C. partellus
in many countries.
By measuring some life history parameters, the variability of C. flavipes from two
different geographic locations, which were reared on two different geographic
populations of C. partellus, was studied. The parameters taken were suitability test,
developmental time, realized fecundity and longevity. The suitability test was studied
at constant temperature of 28oc, while developmental time, realized fecundity and
longevity were studied at constant temperatures of 20oc, 25oc, 28oc and 30oc. All the
experiments were studied under 12L: 12D photoperiod and a relative humidity of 50-
60%. Data were analyzed using SPSS computer software, when ANOVA results were
significant, means were separated by Tukey’s studentized test (HSD).
In the suitability test, the best population interaction was when C. partellus and C. flavipes
populations were from the same geographic area. Both populations of C. flavipes have shown
variability when the hosts were from different geographic populations. The developmental
time of C. flavipes increased as the temperature increased, however, the total progeny
produced per female and longevity increased as the temperature decreased. Effect of
temperature and populations were seen in most of the life history of C. flavipes, which are
bases for successful establishment and efficient parasitism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A study on the diversity and abundance of amphibians was conducted in Meru National
Park (Kenya) from October 2002 to January 2003. Transect sampling, drift-fence and
pitfall trapping as well as opportunistic collections were used to detect amphibians. A total
of 430 individuals of amphibians comprising eleven species and six families were
observed. Amphibian species diversity was correlated with plant species cover/abundance
in three vegetation communities. Acacia wooded grassland had the highest amphibian
species diversity (H’ = 2.071, D = 6.74). Acacia-Commiphora bushland ranked second (H’
= 1.858, D = 5.88) while Combretum wooded grassland had the least diversity (H’ =
1.581, D = 5.076). The Acacia wooded grassland had the highest abundance (173
individuals) as well as species richness (10 species). Combretum wooded grassland had
eight species (113 individuals) while the Acacia-Commiphora bushland had seven species
(144 individuals). Differences in sex ratios within and between vegetation communities
were not statistically significant (ANOVA, F = 8.3026, P = 0.6914). No differences were
detected on a species by species basis (X2 Test). There was positive linear correlation
between amphibian species diversity and plant species diversity in all vegetation
communities. Hemisus marmoratus and Phrynomantis bifasciatus were exclusively
recorded in the Acacia wooded grassland. Five plant species assemblages were identified
from DCA ordination. These closely matched the three broad vegetation communities
known for the park. There was least habitat disturbance in the Acacia wooded grassland
and a high probability of disturbance in the Combretum wooded grassland. The study
confirmed earlier reports that amphibian diversity and abundance can vary on a very small
spatial scale. Impacts of habitat disturbance were also demonstrated. The need for long
term monitoring of the amphibian population in Meru National Park, by considering
additional environmental parameters and introducing a new fire management policy for
the park is recommended.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The increase in drug resistant tuberculosis, and particularly multi-drug resistant tuberculosis
(MDR-TB) as well as the neglect of discovery and development of new anti-TB drugs that are
active against TB/ MDR-TB at present, increased the need for knowledge of the prevalence
and patterns of primary resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the
community. A total of 76 M. tuberculosis isolates were recovered from sputa specimens of
newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia and confirmed
by culture and standard biochemical tests on L-J media. The specimens were collected
between February and April 2001. Drug susceptibility testing was performed according to the
indirect proportion method. The prevalence and patterns of primary resistance were
determined and any association between patients' characteristics (sex and age) and primary
resistance were analyzed using chi-square test. The results of the present study showed that
primary mono-resistance was highest to streptomycin (14.5 %) followed by isoniazid (2.6 %).
All isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and ethambutol. Primary resistance to any drug
was found in 14 of new PTB patients (18.4 %); and any primary resistance to streptomycin
was 15.8 %; any isoniazid resistance was 3.9 %; any rifampicin resistance was 1.3 %, and it
was nil to ethambutol. The rate of Primary MDR-TB was 1.3 %. Single drug resistance was
higher in males (n=8, 61.5 % of mono-resistant cases) than in females (n=5, 38.5 %). Primary
resistance to a single drug was found in 4 patients in the age group 15-24 (30.8 %), 4 in the
group 25-34 (30.8 %) and 5 in the group 35-44 (38.5 %). Thus, the proportion of patients that
had primary mono-resistance was similar in all age groups and the age groups between 15-44
were totally affected by primary drug resistant strains. Primary MDR-TB (with HRS pattern)
occurred in one patient (1.3 %) belonged to the age group 25-34. Single drug resistance to
streptomycin was found in 8 males (73 %) and in 3 female patients (27 %). Isoniazid monoresistance
was found only in female patients (n = 2, 100 %). The age range of TB patients
that had primary resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis were between 15-44 years, with mean
age of 27.4 years. However, primary resistance was not associated with age and gender
(P&gt;0.05). The drugs isoniazid, ethambutol and rifampicin remain drugs of choice to treat the
majority of drug susceptible TB cases in Bahir Dar. The results of this study underscore the
need for periodic monitoring of drug resistance and improving in TB control performance
both at local and country level.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The multidentate ligand, BDTSTHEBD, was synthesized using precursors such as DAAP,
DAAD, BDTHEBD and thiosemicarbazide and was characterized by FTIR, NMR and
electronic spectroscopy. Co (II) and Ni (II)-complexes were synthesized using the ligand,
BDTSTHEBD, and respective metal chloride in a mole ratio of 1:3 and characterized by
analytical studies, FTIR and electronic spectroscopy, conductance, magnetic
susceptibility measurement and thermal analysis.
The non-electrolyte natures of the complexes were ascertained from conductivity
measurements. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and thermal analysis (TA)
techniques were also used to characterize the metal complexes. UV-VIS and magnetic
susceptibility measurements indicate octahedral geometry for Co(II)-complex and
tetrahedral geometry for Ni(II)-complex.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this paper the level of nicotine in four different varieties of Ethiopian tobacco leaves
was determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method of
analysis. Among the variety of species Virginia tobacco leaves were found to have high
nicotine level (3.26 %), followed by the native tobacco ‘Gaya’ (1.1 %) then burley
tobacco leaves (0.65 %), finally oriental tobacco leaves were found to have lowest nicotine
level, though its actual level of nicotine was not determined .Moreover it was confirmed that
the nicotine level of Ethiopian tobacco leaves increases from bottom to top leaf (stalk)
positions of the tobacco plant, as well it was found that nicotine level of the same species
tobacco differ based on area of cultivation. The levels of nicotine in Ethiopian tobacco
(obtained by this study) were found to be comparable with that in the rest of the world.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The inorganic compositions of three (Ambo, Aquaddis and Highland) brands of bottled
mineral water and tap water samples from different sources that are consumed in Addis
Ababa (Ethiopia) were analyzed using standard methods. FAAS was used for the
determination of four heavy metals (Fe, Cr, Cd and Zn); Cd and Cr were not detected in
all samples. Ion chromatography was used for the determination of common cations (Na+,
K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) and common anions (F-, Cl-, Br-, NO3
-, SO4
2-and PO4
3-) in the bottled
mineral water and tap water samples. Common cations were found to be higher in Ambo
mineral water than other two mineral water samples, some of the anions were not
detected in some of the mineral water samples; phosphate was not detected at all. The
composition of the mineral waters was also compared with that of the tap water. Fe and
Zn were higher concentration in tap water as compared to mineral waters and the reverse
was true in the case of common cations and anions. Some brands of bottled mineral water
with respect to some of the analytes were found not to comply with international
guidelines for drinking water and may not be suitable for babies and people suffering
from heart or kidney diseases. Some physical parameters, pH and electric conductivity of
each water sample were determined; pH in some samples found to be below the lower
limit of WHO guideline.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The electrochemical polymerizations and characterization studies were made for the
monomers 3-hexylthiophene (3HT) and 3-methylthiophene (3MT) with respect to Pt, GC and
Au electrodes. The electrochemical properties of the corresponding polymers poly(3-
hexylthiophene) (P3HT) , poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT) were also studied in a monomer
free LiClO4 - acetonitrile solutions. Copolymers were shown to be electrochemically
synthesized from the monomers 3HT and 3MT and showed intermediate electrochemical
properties between their corresponding homopolymers. The optimum copolymer ratio,
polymerization potential and deposition time that are required to obtain the best
electrocatalytic effect was also demonstrated using various redox species. The electrocatalytic
effect of this copolymer was studied on selected inorganic and organic samples. It was found
that poly(3HT-co-3MT) modified platinum electrode is highly selective and sensitive towards
these redox species. The detection limits for poly(3HT-co-3MT) modified Pt electrode were
also shown for these redox species.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A study of the essential oil of Artemisia schimperi was undertaken. The volatile
constituents of the aerial parts of Artemisia schimperi have been examined by GC, 1HNMR
and 13C-NMR and 18 components comprising 87.4% of the oil have been identified
by GC using Kovat’s index and in some cases by comparison with standard samples. The
oil contained as main components: p-cymene 19.6%, Artemisyl acetate, 12.7%, Geranial
10.5%, Artemisia alcohol 9.2%, and Limonene 6.6%. The oxygenated compounds
constitute 63.6% of the oil. One compound was isolated and the structure was elucidated
based on spectroscopic technique and by comparison of the data with the reported in the
literature.</dc:description>

The synthesis of complexes with transition metal (II) ions (Co2+and Ni2+) were undertaken and the resulting complexes were characterized by 1H NMR, IR, UV-Vis, and AAS spectroscopic techniques. In addition, thermal analysis, Magnetic susceptibility, conductivity measurements and chloride estimation were also through.
Syntheses of the metal complexes were carried out using methanol/triethyl amine (being 1:5) mixture as a solvent. Analytical results reveal that the complexes have 1:4 ligand and metal ratio. Furthermore, based on spectroscopic results (NMR, IR, UV-Vis, and AAS), analytical data and Magnetic moments, enolization and deprotonation of BDSTHEBD were concluded. Four chelating sequences per ligand (NNN, NNO, NNO, and NNN) were identified through which four metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) were coordinated. Subnormal magnetic moments at room temperature suggest metal-metal interactions in the complexes. Octahedral geometry was proposed for the complexes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A kinetic catalytic spectrophotometric method for the determination of trace iron in
aqueous samples is described based on the catalytic effect of iron on the reaction
between 4-AP and DCPS in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in slightly acidic
medium.
In the reaction, iron serves both as a catalyst and a substance to be analyzed by
changing its oxidation state from Fe2+ to Fe3+ and Fe3+ back to Fe2+ in a cyclic manner.
This catalytic action of iron can amplify the effect of the analyte for the trace analysis.
Thus small amount of iron even at ppb levels can be determined by measuring the rate
of the formation of the product.
The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the
reaction product at 510 nm. Total iron was determined in the linear dynamic range of 1-
25 μ M with detection limit 1 μ M.
The developed method was applied for the determination of total iron in mineral waters.
Lack of availability of functioning FAAS and/or GFAAS prohibited evaluation of the
accuracy of the method. An attempt was made to evaluate the method through recovery
test, however, that too was not successful because of the presence of iron in acid,
reagent and distilled water used during the experimental work.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A THESIS SUBMITTED TO DEPARTEMENT OF CHEMISTRY
ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Samples of tobacco leaves (Virginia type) were collected from two different regions of
Ethiopia (Bilatte and Shoa Robit) which are the only places where this type of tobacco is
harvested. The other three processed tobacco samples were collected from tobacco
manufacturing factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. After collection of the representative
amounts of samples, and samples pretreatment, different digestion procedures were tested
by varying reagent volumes, time of digestion, temperature of digestion, and amount of
the sample to develop a procedure that consume less reagent volume, short digestion
time, low temperature of digestion and smaller mass of the sample. The optimal
procedure required 3:30 hours and consumes 3 mL HNO3 (69-72 %) and 3 mL HClO4
(70 %) to completely digest 0.5 g of both tobacco leaves and processed tobacco samples.
The accuracy of the optimized procedure was evaluated by analyzing the digest of the
spiked samples with standard solution. Recoveries of the spiked samples varied from
88.3% to 104.3% and 91.7% to 107% for leaves and processed tobacco, respectively.
Concentrations of metals in the samples; (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were analyzed by
flame atomic absorption spectrometer employing a four point external calibration curve.
The observed average metals concentrations were (mean ± ts/N1/2, μg/g at 95% CL and
N=9): Cu (4.38 ± 0.11), Zn (53.7 ± 0.96), Cd (1.2 ± 0.05) in tobacco leaves collected
from Bilatte; Cu (7.3± 0.19), Ni (1.9 ± 0.08), Cd (1.3 ± 0.04), Cr (1.45 ± 0.11), Zn (33.15
±1.9) in leaves collected from Shoa Robit; Cu (9.8 ± 0.04), Ni (2.35 ± 0.19) Cd (1.45 ±
0.023), Cr (1.65 ± 0.08), Zn (101.2 ± 0.4) in processed tobacco leaves originated from
Bilatte; Cu (12.8 ± 0.11) Ni (2.2 ± 0.05) Cd (1.9 ± 0.05), Cr (1.75 ± 0 .08), Zn (83.75 ± 0
.4) in processed tobacco leaves originated from Shoa Robit; Cu (8.95 ± 0.31), Cd (1.55 ±
0.02), Cr (1.62 ± 0.11), Ni (4.7 ± 0.04), Zn (79.3 ± 0.77) in Nyala. The Concentration of
Pb was lower than detection limit of the instrument (0.1 mg/L) in all tobacco samples; Cr and Ni in tobacco leaves from Bilatte (0.05 and 0.04 mg/L respectively). This study
showed that the metal contents of tobacco leaves varied with the geographical origin in
which the tobacco plant grows, and the metal contents of processed tobacco were higher
than the corresponding leaves. The levels of metals in Ethiopian tobacco are comparable
with that of other countries.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A significant flux of heavy metals, among other toxins, reaches the lungs through
smoking. This project reports the heavy metal concentrations in tobacco from samples of
11 cigarette products, sold in Ethiopia. Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc
(Zn) contents were determined in 11 brands of tobacco cigarette commonly available in
Ethiopia by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The concentration of trace metals in
the cigarettes ranged, Cd, from 1.3 to 7.6 μg/g with mean 2.48 ± 0.32 μg/g, Pb, 0.50 to
12.50 μg/g with mean 6.24 ± 2.2 μg/g, Cu, 2.89 to 25.35 μg/g with mean 13.70 ± 4.12
μg/g, and Zn, 24.40 to 62.55 μg/g with mean 36.22 ± 7.50 μg/g. Comparable results of
trace metals are obtained in both imported and Ethiopian cigarettes. The average trace
metal contents of cigarettes available in Ethiopia are Cd, 1.82 ± 0.39, Pb, 4.23 ± 0.97, Cu,
10.22 ± 3.15 and Zn, 28.18 ± 7.81 μg/cigarette and a person who smokes 20 cigarettes
per day is estimated to increase his/her daily Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn retention by
approximately 0.036, 0.085, 0.204, 0.564 mg/day, respectively. The results indicate that smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke is a serious problem to be taken into account
when carrying out epidemiological studies on human exposure to trace metals</dc:description>

<dc:description>Laggera tomentosa is a perennial fragrant bushy herb endemic plant of Ethiopia.
Chemical investigation on the ethanol extract of the leaves resulted in the
isolation of one sesquiterpene and two flavones namely, 3-(3’- acetoxy-2’-
hydroxy-2’-methyl butyryl)- cuauhtemone(LTE-3), 3’, 5, 6-trihydroxy -3, 4’, 7-
Trimethoxyflavone (LTE-5), 3’, 4’, 5, 7-tetrahydroxy -3, 6- dimethoxyflavone
(LTE-6). Of these LTE-3 and LTE-6 were not reported before to the best of our

<dc:description>Five tea clones of the C. assamica variety grown in Wushwush tea plantation farms, Ethiopia
were analyzed for their contents of essential, non-essential and toxic metals (K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn,
Cu, Zn, Na, Cd and Pb) by atomic absorption flame emission spectroscopy. Among the
macronutrient metals, K was the most abundant element in the tea leaves and soils. Both the tea
leaves and the soils showed similar accumulation pattern in their contents of the studied
macronutrients.
Mn was the predominant micronutrient heavy metal in the tea leaves tissue. Level of Fe in the
leaf tissue was found to be the second abundant micronutrient next to Mn whereas
concentrations of Cu and Co were relatively lower both in the soil and tea samples. Fortunately,
the toxic heavy metals Pb and Cd in the leaf tissues were too low to be detected by the analytical
technique used in this study.
The soils were observed to be acidic (pH 5.04 - 5.49) with high organic matter (5.48 - 6.02%).
Fe was the most abundant metal followed by Mn, Na and Zn in the soils. Unlike the tea leaves,
the soils were found to contain the toxic metal, Cd (0.02 - 1.10 mg/kg). The levels of most of the
metals determined in this study compared well with those reported for tea leaves from some
other parts of the world.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Co (II) and Zn (II) of Ruhemann`s Purple derived from ninhydrin and each of
L- Aspartic acid and L-Threonine were successfully synthesized. The two complexes
were distinctly colored and stable to atmospheric conditions. The complexes were
characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance and magnetic susceptibility; as
well as infrared and electronic spectral studies. The Ruhemann`s Purple was shown to
behave as a monobasic tridentate ONO donor. An octahedral geometry is proposed for
the two complexes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two new vanadyl(IV) complexes with s-triazine based ligands, 4-hydroxy,2,6,bis
(hydrazino)-s-triazine and 4-hydroxy-2,6-bis(hydroxyamino)-s-triazine were synthesized
and characterized by elemental analysis, electronic, FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR
spectroscopy. In addition magnetic susceptibility, cyclic voltammetry, conductivity
measurement, melting point determination and vanadium and sulphate estimation were also
undertaken. Elemental analysis and IR data revealed bi-dentate nature of the ligand and
participation of SO4
2- in coordination of the VO(II)-HBHATZ complex. The nonelectrolytic
nature of complexes was ascertained from conductivity measurements UV-Vis
and magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate a square pyramidal geometry of the
complex.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this project, a phytochemical study has been undertaken on the leaves of
Leonotis ocymifolia and the solvent extract of the plant has been conducted.
Leonotis ocymifolia is indigenous to Eastern and Southern Africa and is
occasionally cultivated for its medicinal uses, which include acting as
ascaricide, an anticancer drug, and as a treatment for ulcers, wounds,
obesity and eczema.
The ethanol extract of the leaves of Leonotis ocymifolia led to the isolation of
two compounds A and E. The structure of compound A was determined by
means of spectroscopic methods (IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and DEPT) but the
structure of compound E could not be determined because of its small
amount which led to see no carbon atom in its 13C NMR spectrum.</dc:description>
