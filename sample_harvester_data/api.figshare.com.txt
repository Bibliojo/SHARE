In practice, many complicated semiconductor manufacturing processes have multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) variables. In addition, the effects of previous process input recipes and output responses on the current outputs might be carried over for several process periods. Under these circumstances, using conventional controllers usually results in unsatisfactory performance. To overcome this, a complicated process could be viewed as dynamic MIMO systems with added general process disturbance and this paper proposes a dynamic-process multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) controller to adjust those processes. The long-term stability conditions of the proposed controller are derived analytically. Furthermore, by minimizing the total mean square error of the process outputs, the optimal discount matrix of the proposed controller under vector disturbance is derived. Finally, to highlight the contribution of the proposed controller, we also conduct a comprehensive simulation study to compare the control performance of the proposed controller with that of the single MEWMA and self-tuning controllers. On average, the results demonstrate that the proposed controller outperforms the other two controllers with a total mean square error reduction about 32% and 43%, respectively.</p></div>", "type": "fileset", "url": "https://api.figshare.com/v1/articles/1328583", "published_date": "00:00, 01 Feb, 2015", "authors": [{"author_name": "I-Chen Lee"}, {"author_name": "Sheng-Tsaing Tseng"}, {"author_name": "Hsin-Chao Mi"}], "links": [], "defined_type": "fileset", "modified_date": "16:08, 19 Jan, 2016"}, {"article_id": 1604765, "title": "Evaluation of 309 molecules as inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP1A2, OATP1B1, OCT1, MDR1, MRP2, MRP3 and BCRP in cryopreserved human hepatocytes in sandwich culture", "DOI": "https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1604765.v1", "description": "<div><p></p><p>1.

Here we designed a novel fluorescent peptide named AU4S for noninvasive detection of ATG4 activity in living cells, which consists of the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), ATG4-recognized sequence \u201cGTFG,\u201d and the fluorophore FITC. Additionally, an ATG4-resistant peptide AG4R was used as a control. CPP can help AU4S or AG4R to penetrate cell membrane efficiently.

Therefore, the difference between AU4S- and AG4R-measured fluorescence values in the same sample, defined as \u201cF-D value,\u201d can reflect ATG4 activity. By detecting the F-D values, we found that ATG4 activity paralleled LC3B-II levels in rapamycin-treated cells, but neither paralleled LC3B-II levels in starved cells nor presented a correlation with LC3B-II accumulation in WBCs from healthy donors or leukemia patients.
