<dc:description>This volume contains selected works of Alexander Rosenberg centering on his theory of noncommutative spaces. The articles are based on preprints published by the Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, published with their permission and the permissions of the Rosenberg family. We hope that grouping the selected papers together will give the reader an opportunity to understand the broadness and deepness of Rosenberg’s ideas.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Growth-Promoting Technologies on Feedlot Performance and Carcass Characteristics of Crossbred Heifers</dc:title>

<dc:description>The use of growth-promoting technologies has become a common practice in the beef cattle industry as producers strive for efficient growth and greater lean deposition. Two common technologies include exogenous hormonal implants and beta-adrenergic agonists (β-AA). Combination implants containing estrogen and testosterone increase muscle mass by elevating protein synthesis and/or reducing protein degradation. The increase in protein synthesis allows the animal to produce more lean muscle tissue. Optaflexx (Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) is a popular β-AA that works as a repartitioning agent to redirect nutrients toward muscle deposition and away from adipose tissue production. The two technologies utilize separate pathways for muscle growth and can have additive results on efficiency and ultimate carcass characteristics. Feedlot heifer responses to growth-promoting technologies have been inconsistent and not as potent as those observed in steers. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of two growth-promoting programs on feedlot heifer performance and carcass composition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Skeletal muscle tissue consists of two main structures that elicit strong influences on cooked meat tenderness: myofibrillar and connective tissues. The myofibrillar component consists of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins that aid in muscle contraction and support. A large portion of meat science literature documents the effects that postmortem aging elicits in terms of weakening the myofibrillar component to improve tenderness. Connective tissue is primarily comprised of collagen, the most abundant protein within the body. The function of this tissue is to support the myofibrillar component and transfer the force of contraction. Collagen, characterized by its solubility, is most commonly identified as the muscle tissue structure that has a large influence on tenderness but is commonly characterized as unaffected by postmortem degradation.
Ractopamine hydrochloride (Optaflexx, Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) is a beta-adrenergic agonist that directs nutrients away from fat accretion to lean muscle production and is commonly fed during the finishing period of cattle production. Anabolic implants are another growth-promoting technology that increases muscle mass. Numerous studies indicate that both technologies increase muscle mass by increasing the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers. In addition, many studies have demonstrated that both growth promotants negatively affect tenderness, which can be improved by aging. Little is known about the effects of growth promotants or extended aging on collagen solubility. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of growth-promoting technologies and extended aging on structural muscle characteristics and meat tenderness.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Beef tenderness is the most important trait affecting consumer beef eating satisfaction. Cuts from muscles with superior tenderness (tenderloin, ribeye, striploin) are consequently most highly valued, but because of recent record-high beef prices, the need to identify more economical cuts that will meet consumer expectations for tenderness is greater than ever. The eye of round (Semitendinosus) has traditionally been marketed as a lower-value cut, primarily owing to its inherent toughness. Tenderness improves throughout postmortem aging and continues to improve in muscles aged for greater than 35 days. Retail steaks from the Semitendinosus receive, on average, 17 days of aging, with almost half (48.5%) receiving less than 14 days. This indicates a significant opportunity for tenderness improvement of Semitendinosus steaks through extended aging times.
In many muscles, including the Longissimus, tenderness depends on anatomical location. Tenderness is often reduced in regions of the muscle closest to the ends or in close proximity to heavy connective tissue seams. Very little is known about the effects of aging and anatomical location on the tenderness of the Semitendinosus.
Warner-Bratzler shear force testing is commonly used to measure beef tenderness objectively. Consumers rate beef with shear values of 9.5 lb as “tender,” so if tenderness of Semitendinosus steaks can be improved to meet this threshold, then the eye of round may offer a suitable alternative to higher-valued cuts for consumers and an opportunity for increased value for processors. Thus, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of aging and anatomical location on the tenderness of Semitendinosus steaks.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of an Experimental Seed Treatment from DuPont on Sudden Death Syndrome Symptoms and Soybean Yield</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Adee, E. A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is a soybean disease that perennially limits yields in the Kansas River Valley. Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and saturated soils contribute to the severity of the disease. Selecting varieties with some degree of tolerance to SDS is the only cultural practice that can reduce the severity of SDS and improve yields. Variety selection alone, however, doesn’t necessarily make soybean production profitable; an added complication is managing irrigation scheduling to avoid saturated soils. A study with seed treatments applied to soybean was conducted at the Kansas River Valley Experiment Field in 2014, with treatments applied to two soybean varieties susceptible to SDS. The study was irrigated earlier and more often than normal for soybean to promote the disease. In the most severely infested plots, more than 50% of the leaf area expressed symptoms of SDS by the R6 growth stage. Treatments with an experimental seed treatment from DuPont (Wilmington, DE) reduced the amount of foliar disease in all varieties and increased yields up to 10 bu/a, or more than 25%.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Tillage Study for Corn and Soybean: Comparing Vertical, Deep, and No-Till</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Adee, E. A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The need for tillage in corn and soybean production in the Kansas River Valley continues to be debated. The soils of the Kansas River Valley are highly variable, with much of the soil sandy to silty loam in texture. These soils tend to be relatively low in organic matter (&#60;2%) and susceptible to wind erosion. Although typically well drained, these soils can develop compaction layers under certain conditions. A tillage study was initiated in the fall of 2011 at the Kansas River Valley Experiment Field near Topeka to compare deep vs. shallow vs. no-till vs. deep tillage in alternate years. Corn and soybean crops are rotated annually. This is intended to be a long-term study to determine if soil characteristics and yields change in response to a history of each tillage system.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Seed Treatment on Sudden Death Syndrome Symptoms and Soybean Yield</dc:title>

<dc:description>Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is a soybean disease that perennially limits yields in the Kansas River Valley. The presence of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and saturated soils have been implicated in contributing to the severity of the disease. Selecting varieties with some degree of tolerance to SDS is the only cultural practice that can potentially reduce the severity of SDS and improve yields. Variety selection alone, however, cannot improve the production of soybeans to make them profitable. The challenge of trying to manage irrigation scheduling to avoid saturated soils further complicates efforts to increase productivity with irrigation while still avoiding SDS. A study with seed treatments applied to soybean was conducted at the Kansas River Valley Experiment Field in 2014, with treatments applied to a soybean variety with a high level of tolerance to SDS. The study was irrigated earlier and more often than normal to promote the disease. The most severely infested plots had more than 50% of the leaf area expressing symptoms of SDS by the R6 growth stage. Treatments with ILeVO from Bayer CropScience (Research Triangle Park, NC) reduced foliar symptoms and increased yields up to 12 bu/a, or more than 25%. These results are similar to those in a 2013 study of varieties with SDS tolerance ranging from very susceptible to more tolerant; the yield increase was up to 16 bu/a, or 40% with the ILeVO seed treatment.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Field experiments were conducted at the North Central Kansas Experiment Field near Scandia, KS, in the summer of 2014 to evaluate effect of late-season nitrogen (N) fertilizer application on modern soybean genotypes under dryland and irrigated environments. The main objective was to determine if the N application late in the season has an agronomical benefit to soybean producers. A unique fertilizer N source (urea) was applied at five N rates (0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 lb N/a) to soybean at the R3 growth stage. Overall soybean yields under dryland conditions ranged from 73 to 89 bu/a, whereas yield variation in the irrigated environment was narrowed and ranged from 90 to 99 bu/a. Application of late-season N fertilizer did not significantly increase soybean yields either under full irrigation or in the dryland environment. Under irrigation, maximum soybean yield was documented at 99 bu/a with the 0-N fertilizer rate, whereas dryland soybean yield was maximized at 89 bu/a with 120 lb N/a.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Field experiments were conducted at the Kansas River Valley Experiment Field, located near Rossville and Topeka, KS, in the summer of 2014 to evaluate effects of late-season nitrogen (N) fertilizer application on modern soybean genotypes. A unique fertilizer N source (urea) was applied at five N rates (0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 lb N/a) to soybean at the R3 growth stage. The main objective was to determine if late-season N application has an agronomical benefit to soybean producers. Overall soybean yields ranged from 43.7 to 57.5 bu/a considering both experimental fields. At Rossville, sudden death syndrome (SDS) affected the final soybean yield potential. Application of late-season N fertilizer did not significantly increase soybean yields at the evaluated sites. Maximum soybean yields, 46 bu/a at Rossville and 57 bu/a at Topeka, were documented at the 0-N fertilizer rate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Subclinical parasitism is commonly observed in stocker cattle. Treatment of internal parasites helps to improve weight gains, feed conversion, and immune status and decreases morbidity and mortality of beef cattle (Hawkins, 1993). Some of the most concerning classes of internal parasites include Cooperia, Haemonchus, and Ostertagia. Commonly used anthelmintics come in the form of pour-ons, oral drenches, and subcutaneous injections. A majority of these drugs are designed to be administered in a single dose and provide defense against stomach worms for approximately 14 to 42 days, but the typical grazing season lasts for approximately 120 days. For grazing cattle to have season-long protection from parasites, they may require a second dose of anthelmintic treatment, which would require cattle to be gathered and processed through a chute in the middle of the grazing season. LongRange (Merial, Duluth, GA) is the first single-dose extended release anthelmintic that provides approximately 100 to 150 days of protection. This is accomplished by combining two forms of the active ingredient: one that is released into the blood immediately after injection and a second that consists of a slow-release polymer that releases the active ingredient gradually throughout the grazing period. The objective of this study was to measure body weight productivity, fecal egg counts, and fly repellent capabilities of LongRange when administered once subcutaneously at 1.0 mg/kg body weight as a long-acting solution compared with a commercially available injectable (Dectomax; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) and saline in stocker cattle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The beef industry has improved the recording of pedigrees and performance data through the use of breed associations and herd health databases. Constant evaluation of genetics and performance has allowed producers to make more informed breeding decisions that help improve herd productivity. As a result of recent droughts and elevated feed and grain prices, however, the American beef cowherd is at a record-low 29 million head. For the United States to continue to be the leading producer of beef in the world, the industry must adopt technologies that improve efficiency of the cowherd and the quality of beef being produced. There are two sizable pools of relatively low-grading, low-value carcass genetics in the U.S. beef industry: (1) southern cattle with significant Bos indicus influence, and (2) cattle with a relatively high percentage of Continental breeding. The objective of this research project was to demonstrate the improvement in marbling and grid premium potential that can be made in a cow base with average to below-average genetic potential in just one generation through the use of genomics and artificial insemination.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Value and Use of Artificial Insemination by Beef Producers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Johnson, S. K.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Dahlke, Garland R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Artificial insemination and estrous synchronization remain underutilized by U.S. beef producers. The most recent National Animal Health Monitoring Survey (NAHMS 2007–08) reported that 7.6% of producers used artificial insemination and 7.9% used estrous synchronization. The most common reason cited for not using these reproductive technologies was time and labor, followed by cost and difficulty. Little information is available on actual management practices used by producers who do use these technologies and their value to such operations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Production of ethanol from corn as an alternative fuel source has significantly affected the pricing landscape for corn as an energy source for livestock. As ethanol usage has become more prevalent, corn prices have become more volatile, especially in critical corn-growing areas that have been affected by drought. Consequently, many beef cattle feeders have become interested in alternative energy sources in an effort to control cost of gain. Second Crop (ADM Corp., Decatur, IL) is a process in which calcium hydroxide is added to fibrous crop residues, such as wheat straw and corn stover. When applied to low-quality roughages, calcium hydroxide disrupts the chemical bonds between lignin and hemicellulose, thus improving digestibility of the fiber by ruminal microbes. Treatment of low-quality forage with the Second Crop process could improve the energy value of forages, effectively decreasing reliance on cereal grains as sources of supplemental energy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chromium (Cr) is an essential micromineral that serves to increase absorption of glucose from blood by potentiating the action of insulin. The ability to increase glucose tolerance could lead to more efficient use of glucose and ultimately to improved growth and efficiency. In addition, Cr may be beneficial in improving the immune response of cattle that are subjected to periods of stress. Organic forms of Cr (i.e., Cr propionate) increase absorption and are more physiologically active than their inorganic counterparts. Chromium propionate is currently the only approved form of organic Cr allowed for supplementation in cattle diets in the United States. Yeast supplements, most commonly in the form of various strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are commonly added to livestock diets as a means of stimulating digestion, intake, and animal performance. The purpose of this experiment was to compare feedlot performance, carcass characteristics, and plasma glucose profiles of cattle fed finishing diets with and without a combination of chromium propionate and yeast supplementation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Proper trace mineral supplementation is necessary for reproductive development and function. Supplementation with various trace minerals has been shown to improve overall sperm quality and morphology and increase the percentage of live sperm. When developing beef bulls, it is necessary to meet trace mineral requirements to ensure proper reproductive success. An injectable trace mineral product has been made commercially available for use in cattle as a supplemental form of chelated selenium, copper, zinc, and manganese. Considering the role of trace minerals in bull reproductive function, we posed the question of whether using an injectable trace mineral product beyond dietary supplementation could improve sperm quality and percentage of bulls passing yearling breeding soundness exams. The objectives of our study were to compare serum trace mineral concentrations of bulls before and after administration of an injection of trace minerals or saline and to compare semen trace mineral concentrations after treatment. To determine if an injectable trace mineral product could be of benefit, we compared serum and semen trace mineral concentrations as well as semen quality and percentage passing a yearling breeding soundness examination in treated and untreated bulls.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Timed artificial insemination (TAI) of beef cows at a predetermined time is a management tool that reduces labor costs associated with conventional heat detection before insemination. Multiple research trials have examined timing of the individual components of the developed protocols associated with TAI. The 7-day CO-Synch + progesterone insert (controlled internal drug release; CIDR) protocol has been shown to initiate ovulation effectively in cycling and noncycling suckled beef cows, often producing pregnancy rates greater than 50% in beef cows. In the current research, we examined using two targeted insemination intervals depending on the occurrence of estrus. We hypothesized that by more closely synchronizing estrus and insemination that pregnancy rates would be increased. We further hypothesized that cows that do not demonstrate estrus and are subjected to a TAI protocol might benefit from an increased interval to insemination.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hops (Humulus lupulus) have played an integral role in beer manufacturing and are widely known for their antimicrobial and preservative properties. Alpha-acids of hops are extracted and utilized to enhance beer flavor, leaving residues largely composed of β-acids. Beta-acid extracts of hops are structurally similar to ionophores and may express ionophore-like traits. Ionophores, including Rumensin (Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN), are used to improve feed efficiency and to decrease the incidence of digestive disturbances in feedlot cattle. A large portion of in vitro studies show benefits from feeding hops or hop acids with results similar to ionophores; however, live animal experiments are needed to confirm these observations. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of β-acid extracts of hops on feedlot performance in cattle fed high-concentrate diets and determine a response to varied doses of β-acid extracts of hops.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Long-Term Nitrogen and Phosphorus Fertilization of Irrigated Grain Sorghum</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schlegel, A.</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Long-term research shows that phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fertilizer must be applied to optimize production of irrigated grain sorghum in western Kansas. In 2014, N applied alone increased yields 49 bu/a, whereas N and P applied together increased yields up to 81 bu/a. Averaged across the past 10 years, N and P fertilization increased sorghum yields up to 73 bu/a. Application of 40 lb/a N (with P) was sufficient to produce more than 80% of maximum yield in 2014, which almost equals the 10-year average. Application of potassium (K) has had no effect on sorghum yield throughout the study period.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Long-term research shows that phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fertilizer must be applied to optimize production of irrigated corn in western Kansas. In 2014, N applied alone increased yields 58 bu/a, whereas P applied alone increased yields only 12 bu/a. Nitrogen and P applied together increased yields up to 152 bu/a. This is slightly above the 10-year average, where N and P fertilization increased corn yields up to 146 bu/a. Application of 120 lb/a N (with P) produced about 91% of maximum yield in 2014, which was similar to the 10-year average. Application of 80 instead of 40 lb P2O5/a increased average yields 9 bu/a.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Iron Chelates in Managing Iron Deficiency Chlorosis in Grain Sorghum</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Obour, A.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Perumal, R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Grain sorghum production in alkaline or calcareous soils is frequently affected by iron (Fe) chlorosis. Soil conditions such as high pH, high free calcium carbonate (lime), and low organic matter favor development of iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC), which can delay crop maturity and reduce yields. Two field experiments were conducted in the summer of 2014 to determine the effectiveness of Fe chelate application in alleviating IDC in grain sorghum. Treatments in the first study were four Fe chelate application rates (0, 3, 6, and 9 lb/a) applied either in-furrow with the seed at the time of planting or 2 weeks after planting. A split treatment of 3 lb/a applied at planting and another 3 lb/a applied 2 weeks after planting was included. The second study was a split-plot design with two Fe chelate products as main plots and sorghum hybrids (Golden Acres 5613 and Sorghum Partners hybrid NK5418) as the subplot factor. Results showed IDC scores among the treatments were significant only in the early stages of growth. Severity of IDC tends to decrease throughout the growing season, confirming the ability of sorghum hybrids to grow out of IDC under favorable environmental conditions. Iron chelate application did improve sorghum yield, with the highest yield occurring when Fe chelate was split-applied at 6 lb/a. The two grain sorghum hybrids evaluated differed in their response to IDC and grain yield. GA5613 showed greater tolerance to IDC than NK5418. Application of Fe chelate to GA5613 had no effect on grain yield; however, Fe chelate application significantly improved grain yields in NK5418. Our preliminary findings suggest the first 30 days of growth may be the critical period to control IDC in grain sorghum.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Response of Wheat to Residual Fertilizer Nitrogen Applied to Previously Failed Corn</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sweeney, D. W.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ruiz Diaz, D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>When drought conditions result in poor corn growth and yield, the potential exists for carryover of fertilizer nitrogen (N) to wheat. Soil sampling at the wheat jointing stage showed that NO3-N levels increased slightly as previous N rate increased up to 240 lb/a N, but did not appear sufficient for the wheat yield increase to previous N rate. The relationship between wheat normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) measurements at jointing and wheat yield was linear. The use of crop active sensors such as the GreenSeeker (Trimble Navigation Ltd., Sunnyvale, CA) may provide plant response data to supplement soil sampling to more adequately determine residual effects on a following wheat crop.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Preliminary results show that two-year average total nitrogen (N) runoff losses and ortho-phosphorus (P) and total P runoff losses in the second year were greater with N-based turkey litter/no-till applications than P-based turkey litter or fertilizer-only applications. Incorporation of turkey litter applied based on N requirements resulted in N and P losses that did not differ from losses from P-based or fertilizer-only treatments. Chemical and statistical analyses of third-year samples will allow for final results and interpretation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Yield effects of irrigation on sorghum and corn were compared, but this report is merely focused on the sorghum phase of the crop rotation. Mean yield for irrigated sorghum was 168 bu/a, whereas dryland yield was 145 bu/a. The latter represents a yield improvement of 24 bu/a, an increase of approximately 2 bu/a per unit (in.) of water applied (considering a total of 11 in. of water applied in the irrigation block).
The irrigated sorghum used a mean of 7.8 in. more water than the dryland, which suggests that the dryland sorghum consumed 3.4 in. more water from the soil profile than the irrigated sorghum (this value assumes no water losses due to runoff or deep percolation and is calculated from total precipitation and irrigation as well as changes in profile water status). Water use efficiency, or WUE, was calculated as the ratio of yield to water use. A trend for superior WUE of 6.5 bu/in. was documented under dryland conditions, compared with 5.6 bu/in. for irrigated sorghum.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Seeding Date Effects on Camelina Seed Yield and Quality Traits</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Obeng, E.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Obour, A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Identifying crops that are adapted to dryland environments of the central and northern Great Plains (GP) has been a major challenge. An alternative crop with potential for dryland crop production in the GP is camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz). Time of planting is an important management consideration that can affect camelina production. Early planting allows camelina to mature before the onset of hot summer temperatures in the central GP that can affect seed yield. A study was carried out in the spring of 2013 and 2014 to evaluate planting date effects on spring camelina varieties grown under dryland conditions in western Kansas. In this study, three spring varieties (Blaine Creek, Pronghorn, and Shoshone) were planted at three seeding dates (early, mid, and late). Parameters collected included plant height, harvest index, seed yield, and oil and protein content. Our findings indicate that seeding date affected time of flowering and physiological maturity (P &#60; 0.05) but had no effect on oil content. Year × camelina variety interaction had a significant effect on seed yield. Similarly, protein content differed among the varieties (Blaine Creek &#62; Pronghorn &#62; Shoshone). Blaine Creek consistently produced the highest yield in both years and had a protein content of 30%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This workshop will be aimed at working through the practical and pedagogical choices about creating a digital humanities course. We will explore sample syllabi, discuss potential projects, survey various tools, and identify obvious and not-so-obvious pitfalls to constructing a class that engages students in the scholarship and practice related to digital humanities. Not in the humanities? Come join us anyway. Most of these ideas and approaches apply to incorporating technology into any course.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>AZIMUTH 3D: A Tool for Publishing and Annotating Rich Historical 3D Reconstructions on the Web</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Coltrain, James</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Despite continuing innovations in the real time display of 3D models inside web browsers, scholarly 3D historical reconstructions still have yet to make a major impact on the digital humanities landscape. This presentation will demonstrate the completed features from the first edition of Azimuth 3D, a tool developed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to allow humanities scholars to easily publish, annotate, and combine 3D reconstructions with other 3D data sets. As a result researchers can create persistent, richly annotated, collaborative 3d environments that can grow over time, all viewable in any web browser.
Azimuth 3D is comprised of a web application that runs as a shell around 3D scenes constructed with Unity, an industry leading free and customizable online game engine. Azimuth is designed to allow the greatest degree of detail and customization while preserving the workflows of both 3D artists and digital humanities scholars. Creators can import completed content in any major 3D format into the Unity editor, and then need only to tag parts of the scene as Azimuth objects before exporting them to the Azimuth web app. In Azimuth, a creator can link a published 3D scene to any standard MySQL database, and then assign scene objects custom metadata, chronological information, annotate them, and link them to primary documents used in the reconstruction. Chronologically tagged objects will appear, evolve, and disappear as users move a timeline slider.
After the initial setup of the scene objects, creators will be able to continue to enrich Azimuth scenes by connecting other digital humanities data in traditional formats. Azimuth will allow for the uploading of spatial data with standard geographic coordinates, including CSV and KML files, plotting the points live in the 3D space. Any associated or linked information to those spatial points will be viewable in the user interface. Import features will also support data in vector graphics formats like SVG, as well as georeferenced maps that users can match to the topography of the terrain. Azimuth will also include a tool for matching the perspective of imported historical photographs with the scene view. Additionally, Azimuth features a tool with which users can annotate either scene space or individual objects. Each of these annotations will also be saved as separate layers, allowing for collaboration between scholars, three dimensional peer review, and community contributions to scenes. Each imported data set will be listed as a separate layer which users may toggle on and off.
Azimuth will provide scholars with great freedom to bring different kinds of humanities data together in a single 3D environment. This will allow for different sets of humanities data to contextualize one another without forcing researchers to learn to work in unfamiliar formats, or convert large sets of existing data. Because Azimuth is based on Unity, the platform will automatically incorporate updates and advances in the underlying game engine, freeing scene creators to focus on advancements in the display of humanities content, without having to worry about incorporating improvements in graphics technology.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Brief Narrative of Cheyenne Migration: 1650-1880</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Buchkoski, John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This proposed presentation demonstrates how a variety of off-the-shelf visualization tools may help answer questions posed during historical research into how Cheyennes — a Great Plains indigenous nation — adjusted to dynamic differences among landscapes. While partly based upon preexisting thesis research, it was assembled with a variety digital tools more familiar to anthropologists and geographers than historians including ArcGIS, SketchUp, Story Map applications, and others. Its products also point toward the importance of considering cross-disciplinary collaboration and non-academic audiences in digital heritage work.
This presentation serves as a portfolio of work which indicates the efficacy and relevancy of these tools to historians. For example, visualizations built with ArcGIS illustrate how human factors forced Cheyennes from a tallgrass ecosystem of the eastern Great Plains centered on the Mille de Lacs region of central Minnesota into the mixed-grass and shortgrass ecosystems of the High Plains. These same data visualizations clearly demonstrate that the Cheyennes followed watercourses into their new homelands, and support the argument that they only adopted horses once they reached the mixed-grass region of the Great Plains. These grasses were protein rich and gave both horses and bison the necessary nutrients that they needed. Finally, tools like SketchUp can be used to draw attention to the spatial break represented by the arrival of Euroamericans. While the new trade benefited Cheyennes, it also eventually led to the arrival of gold seekers and conflict over water. While some of these conclusions are familiar to historians of the North American West, data visualization tools demonstrate them more starkly and can be used to expand the audience for them.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Passages Across the Plateau</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hanson, Clayton</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This presentation is intended to illustrate and illuminate how ArcGIS can be used to visualize the connections between protohistoric and historic spatial stories in the Inland Northwest around the Camas Prairie and Palouse regions of Idaho and Washington. The project’s broader goals are as follows: visualize significant indigenous regions of subsistence and residence in the late pre-historic and protohistoric period, uncover spatial connections among them, and show how European and European-American road and survey work interacted with those people and sites. It pays particular attention to the work and surveys associated with the construction of the Fort Walla Walla to Fort Benton wagon road (the so-called Mullan Road).
A key story and analytical ambition of the project was to discover the way in which Native Americans shaped European-American encounters and routes across the Bitterroot, Coeur D’Alene, Saint Joe, Beaverhead, and Centennial ranges in modern northeastern Washington and Idaho during the 1850s. Did Native American informants shape the presentation of their knowledge to direct road construction away from sensitive subsistence sites? Was this especially acute in the areas where there were a diversity of approaches to the high passes? Did the routing of the Mullan Road reflect the shortest/easiest route or some other combination of factors? What natural resources and features interested the European-American newcomers? How did these resources and features also influence road construction and usage by European-Americans?
GIS applications more typically associated with anthropology are especially suited to answering these historical questions. By layering historical maps and reconstructions of subsistence areas over modern spatial representations, the story will more effectively reflect the mindsets and concerns of both cartographers, topographical, and construction engineers and their Native American informants. Native American presentations about the difficulty of the routes across the Bitterroot ranges clearly reflected mixed motives both to profit from European-American activity on the route but also to limit interference in existing subsistence and trading networks. Furthermore, European-American road builders were constrained by not only topography but also resources required for travel — especially by pack animal — and proximity to potential mineralogical and agricultural resources. By reconstructing the route, it is possible to more precisely locate historic geographic regions whose toponymy has shifted since the middle of the nineteenth century. Finally, the information needed to answer these questions can also be used to reconstruct the historic geography of the area from traditional names to land use patterns and more in a way that might be engaging to the public and scholars in other disciplines.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Touring the Kansas River with the Kaw</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rittenbush, Lauren</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Kanza Language and Landscape working group consists of an informal group of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds and expertise, but sharing interests related to the Kansas River and the people for whom it was named.  Several projects have developed through our conversations including a virtual tour of the Kansas River.  This exploration of the local landscape incorporates historical, cultural, and, importantly, linguistic information pertaining to the Kanza (Kaw) Indians.  Not only is this a cross-disciplinary project drawing together the humanities and social sciences, but is designed for the modern Kanza and the public in general.  The tour, demonstrated in this presentation, utilizes Google Earth’s Tourbuilder, which provides a useful tool for visualizing, hearing, and discussing geographically based information.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Can I Get a Witness?: Network Analysis of Nebraskan Homesteaders</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wingo, Rebecca</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In 2014, Fold3.com, a subsidiary of Ancestry.com, finished digitizing over 75,000 records of successful homestead claims for the state of Nebraska. In 2009, Richard Edwards called for a reassessment of homesteading in “Changing Perceptions of Homesteading as a Policy of Public Domain Disposal,” arguing that scholars need to approach homesteading through data analysis rather than anecdotal evidence (however compelling it tends to be). Using the newly digitized records, I sampled ten townships over two counties to thoroughly examine and document every homestead claimant, creating the most sustained study of homesteaders to date. While data sets are great, it’s what we do with data that makes it important. I used Gephi to map the social connections of homesteaders based on the four witnesses each homesteader listed in their Proof of Posting, essentially a newspaper blurb announcing their intention to “prove up.” Network analysis of these known connections indicates the prevalence of fraud (spoiler alert: it’s not as much as previous scholars have led us to believe) and accentuates both incidental and intentional ethnic community formation. Geolocation of the homesteaders further reveals patterns of  witnessing that demonstrate the function neighborhoods in the rural west. Ultimately, this project merges qualitative methodologies with close-readings of the documents to produce ground-breaking research on homesteading in Nebraska.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Towards Zero: Preservation in the Digital Humanities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ringness, Allison</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Librarians and humanists have long had a shared history based on the essential nature of texts to their work.  That relationship remains as both libraries and humanities have delved into the digital realm.  However, as Agatha Christie’s Mr. Treeves noted, detective stories begin by putting the murder in the wrong place—at the end.  Preservation most often is considered at the wrong place, too, at the end of digital library and digital humanities projects.
The transition from operating in the print realm to that of the digital has been uneven: some institutions are still in the exploratory phase, while others are maturing and thinking about project lifecycles.  Traditional relationships between humanities scholars and librarians have been disrupted.  Some digital humanities centers are housed in humanities departments while others are part of the university library.  Digital humanities programs at universities may have digital humanities librarians, but not necessarily.
Librarians’ training in digital information management remains uneven as well.  Library schools have taken a variety of approaches to incorporating digital information management into the curriculum.  Before completing their Master’s in Library Science, librarians have the opportunity to study in humanities, technology, or another field entirely.  As a result, librarians’ paths to positions with titles Digital Projects Librarian or Digital Humanities Librarian are circuitous, with education and training continuing on the job.
In the struggle to define the practices of digital humanities and digital librarianship, to legitimize these offshoot fields as areas of study and practice, the connection to texts remains, but preservation is usually misplaced.  This presentation examines the necessity of moving preservation to its proper place—towards zero.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Claiming One Future for Digital Humanities: Undergraduate Learning, Creation, &#38; Ownership</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McClurken, Jeff</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Discussions and scholarship in Digital Humanities often don’t include undergraduates. But they should. The field represents an important frontier for teaching, learning, and scholarship, and not just for researchers or for graduate students. Incorporating digital tools in the humanities can and should be a key part of the undergraduate research experience. One path for Digital Humanities embraces the idea that undergraduate students should be active participants in the consumption, analysis, and construction of knowledge, claiming for themselves roles as learners, creators, and owners.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Over the Roofs of the World: Politics of Freeness in Literary Digital Archives</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cohen, Matt</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Walt Whitman Archive (http://www.whitmanarchive.org) is a digital editing environment that is free to access, university based, and competes with many other Whitman sites on the web. In terms of literary distribution, the Whitman Archive provides the opportunity to explore what we now know as a problematic issue regarding open access in the larger and longer frame of the history of free distribution of Whitman&#39;s work. Such free distribution stretches back to the poet&#39;s own time. Responding to Virginia Jackson&#39;s important argument about digital literary archives and literary criticism, this talk examines the free distribution of Whitman&#39;s work in the digital age.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How has Creepypasta transformed folklore?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Williams, Christi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Writing is a way for people to connect with one another and express themselves. There are many different mediums to write and it has changed over time. The internet has allowed people to write to express themselves, connect with others, and to share emotions with one another. We still share folklore stories but in different ways. Instead of passing on the stories orally people now use images, videos, blogs, and memes on the internet to make the stories very effective in provoking shared emotions that cultures hold. By researching the way that stories get spread over the internet we can see how people use folklore in a modern way to express our shared emotions.
In this paper, I argue that creepypasta is a modern form of folklore. Creepypastas are essentially stories with horror elements to share on forums with likeminded writers. They use videos, blogs, images, and memes to make the story effective in provoking shared emotions with others. Creepypastas are much like folklore stories because they are easy to read and get to a central point that allows others to relate to it. Famous creepypasta stories usually have a core “story” and then is retold over and over which causes it to have variants in the original story much like old folklore used to spread. Old folk tales have variants where the ending is changed and sometimes heroes are killed rather than surviving. Creepypasta is now digital version of folklore that is used to share and express commonly shared emotions and to make certain points effective by using a certain writing style.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Vices of If, or, How Conjunctions Signify in a Billion-Word Corpus</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lamb, Jon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper, emerging from a book project on Shakespeare’s use of particular formal features, will explore the computational possibilities of the full-text resources in the Early English Books Online database. Specifically, I will use various programs and portals to investigate the conjunction “if” in its literary, rhetorical, syntactic, and epistemological contexts. To accomplish this work, I will draw on collaborations with computer scientists, computational linguists, and historians of science. The aim is not so much to perform a “distant” or “close” reading of “if” as to achieve a sort of middle-distance interpretive history. Such a reading allows us 1) to view the changing semantic functions of “if” in early modern English culture and 2) to situate instantiations of “if” in the context of those changing functions. When Shakespeare’s Shylock asks, “If you prick us [Jews], do we not bleed?” what cultural possibilities does his syntax actuate? When Portia, in the same play, says to her soon-to-be husband, “if you do love me, you will find me out,” how does her “if” compare? The paper’s main claim is that in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, “if” acquired a strong association with knowledge production, specifically in the context of the rise of skepticism and empiricism as scientific principles. If indeed early modern Europe set the scene, as it were, for modern science, then the epistemological heft of “if” makes it the most important word in the world.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Fanny Fern in The New York Ledger</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McMullen, Kevin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the mid-nineteenth century Fanny Fern was the highest paid newspaper columnist in the United States, writing for the widest-circulated publication of its day, The New York Ledger. However, when making claims about Fern’s journalistic career, the vast majority of Fern scholarship to this point has relied either on Fern&#39;s six published collections of columns or on the selected columns reprinted in Joyce W. Warren&#39;s Ruth Hall and Other Writings (1986). Yet these printed sources represent less than half of Fern’s total journalistic output. The most likely reason for this is one of access. The full run of Fern&#39;s columns is simply not readily available. The Olive Branch, True Flag, and Musical World and Times (for which Fern wrote early in her career) have only been very selectively microfilmed and full runs of print copies exist only at a limited number of repositories. And while a full run of The New York Ledger exists on microfilm, Fern&#39;s columns extend across nearly twenty reels, making the locating of any one column exceedingly cumbersome. My current project, Fanny Fern in The New York Ledger (http://fannyfern.org), a digital archive that provides access to full-text transcriptions of Fern’s columns and high-resolution digital images of complete issues of the Ledger, is an attempt to remedy this problem.
In my presentation I will lay out the problems inherent in relying on such selective sources when studying Fern and provide specific examples of ways in which access to the totality of Fern&#39;s newspaper columns significantly alters the picture of her journalistic persona as presented in most scholarship to this point. And given the relative rarity of original and microfilm copies of the periodicals for which she wrote and the sheer size of Fern&#39;s output, I will make a case for the necessity of an online archive that collects all of Fern&#39;s journalistic writing, and discuss the methods with which I went about creating this digital archive. In so doing, I hope to prove that a continued reliance on selective sources perpetuates a patchwork literary record of a writer who deserves to be studied in her fascinating and complex entirety.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Using cyber folk metalanguage to explore language variation and indexicality in non standard languages: The case of Trinidadian Creole English in soca music</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Leung, Glenda</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In sociolinguistics, language variation may be investigated through various analytical frames. For instance, variation can be analyzed with respect to social correlates such as gender, socio-economic class, age, ethnicity, or geographical region. In contrast, how language variation is used to construct social meaning may also be examined, particularly in highly contextualized scenarios in which language variants are employed to perform stylistic work. Social meaning is the ideological stance conveyed and interpreted in the deployment of a particular linguistic variant. Indexicality is an approach which interrogates relationships between linguistic variation and multiple layers of social meaning, by appealing to orders of indexicality (Silverstein, 2003). For instance, mapping linguistic variation to social categories (e.g. geographical region, ethnicity, etc.) is an example of first-order indexicality, whereas more nuanced associations of a linguistic variant to local or context-specific ideologies are considered second- or third-order indexicality, and so forth. Folk metalanguage—conscious, overt commentary about language by non-linguists (Niedzielski &#38; Preston, 2000)—is one resource which lends insight into ideologies associated with additive orders of indexicality (i.e. second-, third-, etc.). Considering folk metalanguage is particularly useful in the case of non-standard, oftentimes stigmatized, language varieties such as creoles. However, non-elicited folk metalanguage is challenging to source, especially if the language variety does not have a standardized orthography. Growing accessibility to the participatory Web (Web 2.0) has resulted in social media technologies being instrumental in generating communities. The broad-based participation that social media facilitates makes posting or publishing on the internet a social act, giving speakers of non-standardized languages social agency. This paper examines the indexical orders associated with the Trinidadian Creole English (TCE) vowel variant /ɒ/ which occurs in words belonging to the NURSE lexical set (Wells, 1982), such as work, dirty, worth, and thirst. In this analysis, Youtube comments are used as a source of cyber folk metalanguage to explore third-order indexicality associated with TCE vowel /ɒ/ in soca music, a musical genre indigenous to Trinidad which pervades the Trinidadian soundscape during the preLenten carnival season. Carnival practices and the carnivalesque have long been associated with subversion and inversion (Bakhtin, 1968). Hence, this research is concerned with the ideological opposition and resistance to respectability as manifest in carnival, and by extension, soca music. Data is taken from Youtube commentary on four songs: “Wotless” worthless /ˈwɒtˌlɛs/ by Kes (2011), “Hard Wuk” hard work /haːd wɒk/ by Machel Montano (2011), and “Dutty” dirty /ˈdɒˌti/ and “Tusty” thirsty /ˈtɒsˌti/ by Blaxx (2007, 2009). In these songs, the TCE vowel /ɒ/ occurs in the hook, “that part of a song’s musical and lyrical material through which the song remains in popular memory and is instantly recognizable in popular consciousness” (Shepherd &#38; Horn, 2003). Because of the saliency of the language variant in the hook, rich folk metalanguage is found in Youtube comments. The hook also has the call-response function (Smitherman, 1977) of inviting the listener to identify ideologically with a certain type of vagabondage that is licensed during carnival, and to embody a response through louche, improvisational dance.

			<dc:title>The use of Web 2.0 technologies to gather both production and perceptual data for the  study of regional linguistic variation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brown, Earl K.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The use of both production and perceptual data has the potential to provide a more complete picture of linguistic phenomena than would otherwise be the case, including when exploring regional linguistic variation. Web 2.0 technologies are increasingly providing language data suitable for studying regional variation in language. Web 2.0 refers to the transition from the display of content on static webpages to the display of content on dynamic webpages that change according to input from the users, and includes social media platforms. Utilizing the social networking platform Twitter and an online survey, this paper reports on a descriptive analysis of the geographic distribution of a less-commonly used syntactic form of the Spanish verb gustar &#39;to like, to please&#39;, referred to as experiential gustar (e.g., cuando gustes &#39;when you&#39;d like&#39;). The production data were extracted from Twitter using the computer programming language R. A search was performed to find this verb in tweets sent from within a 100- kilometer radius of the capital cities in Spanish-speaking Latin America and in Spain. Subsequently, the perceptual data were gathered from an online survey that used a dynamically-generated webpage in order to randomize the presentation of two versions of the verb to the participants. The purpose of the survey was to determine where in the Spanish-speaking world the less common form of the verb is most preferred as well as where it is perceived to be used most frequently. The results from the analysis of 6,686 tweets and the responses of 81 native Spanish-speaking participants in the online survey suggest that experiential gustar is produced and is perceived to be produced most often in Mexican Spanish, despite not being exclusive to that country. The paper contributes to the literature depicting the benefit of using both production and perceptual data in the study of dialectal variation, as well as to the literature documenting language variation in Spanish. Finally, the paper demonstrates the usefulness of utilizing Web 2.0 technologies, including social media platforms, to study language use and regional linguistic variation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Textual Portraits: Using Word Clouds to Visualize Digitized Texts for Comparison and  Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Harren, Shonn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Digital collections of textual material have become rich repositories for primary source materials. However, dense collections of digitized text can prove daunting to patrons or students seeking to access and analyze the documents contained within them. This presentation will discuss how word clouds may be used as an effective tool to allow students or patrons to compare and analyze digitized texts. Word clouds are a form of data visualization performed on free text, that breaks down structure of a document is broken down, and a &#34;cloud&#34; of the words contained in the document is generated in which the size of the words within the cloud are determined by the frequency of their appearance within the original document. This presentation will provide an explanation of word clouds, demonstrating how to generate a word cloud utilizing Wordle, a freely available online word cloud generator.
This presentation will also discuss how word clouds generated from key texts in a digital collection may be utilized for promotional purposes, in order to illustrate or draw patron&#39;s attention to particular a particular document or documents within a collection.
Finally, using a variety of examples, this presentation will demonstrate how word clouds may be used to assist patrons and students in analyzing and comparing digitized texts or bodies of texts, in order to both facilitate discussion and encourage further exploration of digital collections by students or patrons.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Breaking Corn Yield Barriers: A Cropping Systems Approach</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Balboa, G. R.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ciampitti, I. A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A corn research trial was conducted at Scandia, KS, during the 2014 growing season. The objective was to study the contribution of different farming systems in developing efficient and high-yielding corn production systems. The experiment had five treatments: farmer practices, comprehensive fertilization, production intensity, ecological intensification, and advanced plus. Farmer practice was the lowest-yielding treatment, and ecological intensification and advanced plus treatment presented similar yields.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Ciampitti, I. A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Corn hybrid development with a focus on drought tolerance has emerged in recent years, and producers have questions about their yield performance across a range of plant populations. A two-year study was conducted to determine the yield of corn hybrids across several plant populations. Corn hybrids responded differently in 2013 and 2014. In 2013, a lower yield environment occurred. The hybrid with drought tolerance had the greatest yield of 95 bu/a at a plant population of 21,500 plants/a, whereas the non-drought-tolerant hybrid’s greatest yield was 90 bu/a at a plant population of 13,500 plants/a. In 2014, the yield environment was significantly higher. The hybrid with drought tolerance had the greatest yield of 174 bu/a at the greatest plant population of 35,500 plants/a, and the non-drought tolerant hybrid’s greatest yield was 169 bu/a at a plant population of 29,500 plant/a.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Direct-fed microbials commonly have been used to enhance performance or to decrease shedding of foodborne pathogens in beef cattle. Megasphaera elsdenii is a recently introduced probiotic bacteria marketed under the trade name Lactipro (MS-Biotec Inc., Wamego, KS) and is a key lactate-fermenting bacterium in the rumens of cattle fed high-concentrate diets. Megasphaera elsdenii is responsible for metabolizing up to 95% lactic acid within the rumen, and thus is an important species for controlling occurrence of ruminal acidosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ruminal pH and volatile fatty acid concentration during the transition from a diet with 60% concentrate to a diet containing 80% concentrate after administering five different oral dosages of Lactipro.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study was conducted to determine corn response to three foliar-applied zinc sources. The study was conducted on dryland corn in Manhattan, KS, during the 2014 growing season. Yields were low as a result of very low precipitation during pollination and grain fill. There was no yield response to foliar-applied Zn; however, grain analysis show significant increases in grain Zn concentration from foliar-applied Zn. Foliar-applied Zn products are effective for increasing Zn uptake in corn. Additional studies need to be conducted to determine the yield response.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Performance of Beef Replacement Heifers Supplemented With Dried Distillers Grains With Solubles Versus a Mixture of Soybean Meal and Finely Ground Sorghum Grain</dc:title>

<dc:description>Costs of feed, labor, and equipment to develop heifers in a traditional confined feeding system are relatively high. Producers can greatly reduce input costs by developing heifers on dormant native range; however, heifers are unable to consume sufficient protein from the forage base. Suboptimal protein intake will reduce forage digestion and result in poor performance. Supplemental protein is required during these times to increase forage intake and digestion. The most efficient way of providing supplemental protein to heifers consuming lowquality (&#60;7% crude protein) forage is by feeding high-protein supplements (&#62;30% crude protein). Producers traditionally have used high-quality oilseed meals to supplement the necessary protein, but expansion of the ethanol industry has made dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) a potentially less expensive supplement option for producers in corn- and sorghum-producing areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of daily supplementation of DDGS vs. a mixture of soybean meal and finely ground sorghum grain on performance of replacement heifers grazing low-quality dormant native range.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparing Standing Heat and Estrotect Heat Detection Patches</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Johnson, S. K.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Jaeger, J. R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A recent survey showed that 66% of producers surveyed used some amount of heat detection in their artificial insemination program, and 74% of producers that used heat detection aids had tried Estrotect (Rockway, Inc.; Spring Valley, WS) heat detection patches. The peel-and-stick application made Estrotect more popular than types that required adhesive application. The patches are designed so that when the animal is mounted the top surface layer is removed, much like scratching a lottery ticket. After several mounts the entire layer is removed, leaving a bright-colored surface behind. A new type of patch, Standing Heat (Standing Heat, LLC; Dannebrog, NE), was recently released and has a surface layer designed to rub off with the goal of reducing false positive readings due to inadvertent scratches such as from branches or tail switching. The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy of two different heat detection patches.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Menthol is a naturally occurring compound classified as an essential oil that gives plants of the Mentha species their characteristic minty aroma and flavor. Menthol is used as a cooling compound in products ranging from common cold medications to pesticides and has been found to have a wide range of biological activities in different systems within the body. More recently, menthol and other essential oils have been identified as potential alternatives to feed antibiotics and growth promotants. Menthol has been observed to directly affect κ-opioid receptors. Kappa opioid receptors are located in the central nervous system, with a high density found in the hypothalamus. Menthol has been hypothesized to be capable of binding to κ-opioid receptors in the hypothalamus, stimulating neuropeptides involved in the production and release of growth hormone and leading to increased insulin-like growth factor-1 concentration, thus increasing growth. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate changes in blood metabolites when menthol was incorporated into the diets of steers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Zilmax (Merck Animal Health; Summit, NJ) is in a class of feed additives known as beta agonists and is designed to improve production efficiency in cattle when fed 20 days prior to harvest. Zilmax works by altering deposition of body tissue to more lean muscle than fat. Zinc is an essential mineral necessary for normal growth and development of all mammals. Zinc functions largely in enzymes involved in protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism along with many other biological reactions. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in blood components and to evaluate the interactive effects of zinc and Zilmax supplementation on growth and carcass characteristics of finishing steers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Feed is the greatest cost for a beef cattle production enterprise. Data collection to determine feed efficiency of animals is also costly, because both gain and intake records are needed to calculate feed efficiency. Electronic intake monitoring systems such as GrowSafe or Insentec to collect feed intake data are expensive and thus limit the number of animals that can be tested. Scientists have worked to pinpoint optimal test durations for collecting both weight gain and feed intake records to lessen costs.
A 70-day performance test is currently recommended for accurate calculation of efficiency, with growth data as the limiting factor. Research has suggested that a 35-day test is adequate to measure feed intake, but a test period of at least 70 days is suggested to measure gain with sufficient accuracy. The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for growth and intake traits with particular attention to the relationship between on-test average daily gain (ADG) and national cattle evaluation postweaning gain (PWG). If the correlation between these two traits is strong, it could allow for the use of PWG as a proxy for ADG in the genetic evaluation of feed efficiency. This substitution would allow producers to reduce the length of the test required to measure feed intake accurately.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Yield effects of irrigation on sorghum and corn were compared, focusing only on the grain sorghum phase. Average water use for irrigation was 22 in., and dryland sorghum used 17 in. Average yields based on 12.5% grain moisture for dryland and irrigated sorghum were similar, with 138 bu/a for the irrigated and 142 bu/a for the dryland environment. Irrigated sorghum yields were similar, but in dryland, the Pioneer 84G62 hybrid yielded 149 bu/a, a 10 bu/a increase over Pioneer 84Y50 and DKS 53-67 hybrids, which yielded 139 bu/a and 138 bu/a, respectively. Although there was a difference in the yield between the hybrids on the dryland block, there were no significant differences between water use and water use efficiency (WUE).</dc:description>

<dc:description>A field experiment was conducted at the East Central Kansas Experiment Field near Ottawa, KS, and at the Kansas River Valley Experiment Field near Rossville, KS, in the summer of 2014 to evaluate diverse cropping systems approaches on closing sorghum yield gaps. Yield gaps can be understood as the difference between maximum yield and attainable on-farm yields. The factors that were tested include narrow row spacing; plant population; balanced nutrition practices, including various timings of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) and micronutrient applications; crop protection with fungicide and insecticide applications; plant growth regulator effects; and the use of precision ag technology for maximizing yields, including a GreenSeeker meter (Trimble Navigation, Westminster, CO) for more precisely determining fertilizer nitrogen needs for sorghum. In addition, this project seeks to quantify the comparison between corn and grain sorghum grown side by side at two production input levels (low vs. high). Only sorghum grain yields are presented in this report. Grain sorghum yields were 115 to 135 bu/a in Rossville (under irrigation) and 60 to 80 bu/a in Ottawa (dryland). Rainfall was limited in Ottawa during the flowering and reproductive stages of growth, which drastically limited yield potential.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A field experiment was conducted at the North Central Kansas Experiment Field near Scandia, KS, in the summer of 2014 to evaluate diverse cropping systems approaches to closing sorghum yield gaps. Yield gaps can be understood as the difference between maximum and attainable on-farm yields. The approach taken in this project is system wide, rather than focusing on one factor and its interaction. The factors that were tested include narrow row spacing; plant population; balanced nutrition practices, including various timings of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) and micronutrient applications; crop protection with fungicide and insecticide applications; plant growth regulator effects; and the use of precision ag technology for maximizing yields, including a GreenSeeker meter (Trimble Navigation, Westminster, CO) for more precisely determining fertilizer nitrogen needs of sorghum. Grain sorghum yields ranged from 95 to 125 bu/a in Scandia under dryland conditions. One of the lowest yields was obtained when common practices were implemented (treatment 10), with an average 103 bu/a, whereas maximum yield was registered with the “kitchen sink (all inputs are applied)” treatment (treatment 1), with an average 115 bu/a. Notwithstanding the lack of treatment difference, the grain sorghum yield gap from a common practice to “kitchen sink” was 12 bu/a.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Two soybean research trials were conducted at Scandia, KS, in dryland and irrigated environments. The objective of this trial was to study the contribution of different farming systems to developing efficient and high-yielding soybean production systems. Each experiment had five treatments: farmer practices (FP), comprehensive fertilization (CF), production intensity (PI), ecological intensification (CF + PI), and advanced plus (AD). Under dryland, FP and CF treatments yielded 34 bu/a, differing in 27 bu/a compared with PI, EI, and AD scenarios. Under irrigation, FP and CF presented comparable yield levels, differing by close to 36 bu/a compared with crop intensification treatments (CF + PI; AD).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Drought-tolerant technologies have become popular in hybrids for low-yielding corn environments across central and western Kansas and are marketed for their ability to produce higher grain yields with less water. The objective of this study was to compare water use, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) of two types of drought-tolerant (DT) corn hybrids and a high-yielding non-DT hybrid. Water use and yield of two DT and one non-DT, high-yielding hybrid were compared in both dryland and irrigated situations. The average yield for the irrigated corn was 217 bu/a, and the average was 127 bu/a in dryland, representing a yield increase of 90 bu/a. The irrigated corn received a total of 10 in. more water than the dryland corn over the course of the growing season, resulting in 9 bu for each additional inch of water use averaged across the three hybrids. The irrigated corn used a mean of 20.85 in. of water, and the dryland corn used a mean of 11.66 in. of water. The WUE was 10.71 bu/in. and 10.43 bu/in. for dryland and irrigated corn, respectively. Although hybrid yields differed in the irrigated environment, water use and WUE were similar for all hybrids in both dryland and irrigated environments. One DT hybrid exhibited more stable yields across dryland and irrigated environments compared with the other DT hybrid and the non-DT hybrid.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Water is a primary concern for producers in the Great Plains; as such, research is warranted to quantify how much cover crops affect the amount of soil water available to subsequent cash crops. Cover crop mixes have been marketed as a means to conserve water in no-till cropping systems following winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) harvest. The objectives of this study are to quantify changes in soil profile water content in the presence of different cover crops and mixtures of increasing species complexity, to quantify their biomass productivity and quality, and to quantify the impact of cover crops on subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) yields. We hypothesized the change in soil water brought on by the cover crop treatments would be correlated to the quantity of biomass produced and the species composition, rather than mixture complexity. Soil moisture was measured using a neutron probe to a depth of 9 ft. Results from 2013–14 showed no difference in water use between cover crop mixtures and single species. Cover crops depleted the soil profile by a maximum of 3.5 in. during growth, but fallow was able to gain 0.75 in. of water during the same period. At the time of corn planting, soil moisture under all cover crops had replenished to levels at cover crop emergence, except for the brassicas, which had extracted water from deeper in the profile. Corn yields were reduced following the grass cover crops and the six-species mix. Corn yields were more closely related to the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio of the cover crop residue than to profile soil moisture at corn emergence. The fact that yields were similar for corn after fallow and for corn after brassica cover crops implied that water was not the cause of yield reductions after the other cover crops.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Optimum planting time for soybean depends on the interaction between genotype and environment (G × E). Four field studies were conducted during the 2014 growing season across eastern Kansas (Manhattan, Topeka, Ottawa, and Parsons). This study explores the impact of planting date (early, mid, and late planting times) on yield for modern soybean cultivars from a range of maturity groups (early, medium, and late groups).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Fertilizer Placement and Tillage Interaction in Corn and Soybean Production</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rosa, A. T.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ruiz Diaz, D. A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Different tillage systems can affect the availability of phosphorus (P) by changing the soil environment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects and interaction of fertilizer placement, tillage, and varieties for soybean and corn. The experiment was established at two locations in Kansas in 2014. The experimental design was a factorial in a randomized complete block with four replications. Three fertilizer treatments were combined with two tillage systems and two varieties of soybean and corn selected based on contrasting root systems. Plant tissue samples were collected during the vegetative and reproductive stages to evaluate P concentration, P uptake, and dry matter. Significant differences were found in the parameters across locations for corn and soybean. Results suggest advantages for deep-band application for soybean and broadcast application for corn. Varieties responded differently in the parameters evaluated in this study.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of Secondary and Micronutrients for Soybean Production in Kansas</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gutierrez, M. N.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Ruiz Diaz, D. A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Study of secondary and micronutrients is growing because of their potential contribution to yield increases. The objective of this study was to evaluate soybean response to secondary and micronutrient fertilizer application to maximize yields. A randomized complete block design was employed with four replications at five locations during 2013 and five locations in 2014. Treatments consisted of an unfertilized control; micronutrient fertilizer as individual nutrients for boron, copper, manganese, sulfur, and zinc; and a mix of these nutrients using two different placements (dry broadcast and liquid band). Soil samples were collected prior to planting and after harvest. Soybean trifoliates were collected at R2–R3 growth stage and analyzed for the micronutrients evaluated in this study. At harvest, nutrient concentration was analyzed in the seed, and yield was calculated at 13% moisture. No significant difference was found in yields between treatments by location or across locations. Results from tissue and grain analysis showed significant treatment effects on zinc concentrations across locations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nitrogen and Sulfur Fertilization Effects on Camelina Sativa in West Central Kansas</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Obeng, E.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Obour, A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Camelina sativa is early maturing and possesses characteristics that make it a good fit as a rotation crop in dryland wheat cropping systems. Nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) play very important roles in oilseed production, including camelina. This study was undertaken in 2013 and 2014 to determine N and S rates necessary for optimum camelina production in West Central Kansas. The experiment was set up as randomized complete blocks with four replications in a split-plot arrangement. Treatments were two S rates (0 and 18 lb/a) as the main plots, and N rates (0, 20, 40, and 80 lb/a) were the subplots. The results showed that plant stand, plant height, harvest index, biomass yield, and protein and oil content were unaffected by N and S application. Similarly, S application had no effect on seed yield. However, N rate had a significant (P &#60; 0.05) effect on seed yield. Yield differences were realized for 2013 (~450 lb/a) and 2014 (~900 lb/a).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Influence of Different Seeding Dates on Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) Forage Yield and Nutritive Value</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Obour, A.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Obeng, E.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Holman, J. D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) is used as medicinal plant in many Asian countries and has been reported to have forage quality similar to alfalfa. Fenugreek is an annual crop and may have the potential to diversify forage production systems in the central High Plains. This study evaluated forage dry matter (DM) production and the nutritive value of three fenugreek cultivars as influenced by planting date at Hays and Garden City, KS, in 2014. Results at Hays showed forage DM yield of fenugreek cultivars was not affected by planting date, but fenugreek cultivars differed significantly (P &#60; 0.05) in forage DM yield. Averaged across planting date, forage DM production was 760 lb/a for ‘Amber,’ 910 lb/a for ‘F96,’ and 672 lb/a for ‘Tristar.’ Forage crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), total digestible nutrient (TDN) concentrations, and relative feed value (RFV) did not differ (P &#62; 0.05) among fenugreek cultivars. Planting early, however, did increase CP levels and lower ADF and NDF concentrations. Despite the lower yields observed in 2014, our preliminary results showed that fenugreek can produce forage with nutritive value comparable to alfalfa and that further testing is needed to determine if fenugreek can provide an option for producers who want to diversify their forage production operations, particularly under limited irrigation conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Optimal soybean planting in southeast Kansas usually occurs from mid-May to mid- June for full-season or late June to early July for double-cropped soybean. Planting is timed to capture fall rains and cooler temperatures during critical periods of bean development and yield formation to avoid midsummer heat and drought.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Soil health is a critical determinant of crop performance. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties can be modified through production practices such as tillage. Use of cover crops has been shown to benefit soil health and may improve productive capacity of soils. High rainfall and intense crop production practices limit the ability to implement cover crops in current production systems in southeast Kansas. This study explores potential management of cover crops and their contribution to soil health, crop productivity, and animal grazing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cover crops offer potential benefits for improving soil health, but establishment and management costs can be expensive. One way for farmers to recover these costs is to graze the forage, which benefits producers by integrating crop and animal production. More information is needed on the potential forage quantity and quality for grazing livestock of cover crops and mixed species of cover crops. Researchers have suggested that different plant species complement each other, but additional work is needed to determine how best to balance forage production and how competitive the various species are when added to a mix. Sixteen treatments were drill-seeded at the Southeast Kansas Research Station near Columbus, KS, in August 2014. Each treatment consisted of a three-way mix representing popular cover crops from the plant families Brassicaceae (brassicas), Poaceae (grasses), and Fabaceae (legumes). Eight species were planted, including forage radish (Raphanus sativus), purple-top turnip (Brassica rapa), oat (Avena sativa), rye (Secale cereale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivium), Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum subsp. arvense), and berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum). Small areas of each plot were clipped at 30-, 60-, and 90-day intervals. The clipped biomass was then weighed, sorted, and dried to determine biomass as well as species composition. Preliminary results indicate that average biomass produced at 30, 60 and 90 days was 1,250, 3,290, and 3,050 lb/a, respectively. These range from 470 to 1,940 lb/a 30 days after planting to 1,790 to 4,440 lb/a at 90 days after planting, depending on the cover crop mix.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Cultivar and Distillers Grains Supplementation on Grazing and Subsequent Finishing Performance of Stocker Steers Grazing Tall Fescue Pasture</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lomas, L. W.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Moyer, J. L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Four hundred thirty-two yearling steers grazing tall fescue pastures were used to evaluate the effects of fescue cultivar and dried distillers grains (DDG) supplementation during the grazing phase on available forage, grazing gains, subsequent finishing gains, and carcass characteristics. Fescue cultivars evaluated were high-endophyte ‘Kentucky 31’ and low-endophyte ‘Kentucky 31,’ ‘HM4,’ and ‘MaxQ.’ Steers were either fed no supplement or were supplemented with DDG at 1.0% body weight per head daily in 2009 or 0.75% of body weight per head daily in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 while grazing. Steers that grazed pastures of low-endophyte ‘Kentucky 31,’ ‘HM4,’ or ‘MaxQ’ gained significantly more (P &#60; 0.05) and produced more (P &#60; 0.05) gain/a than those that grazed high-endophyte ‘Kentucky 31’ pastures. Gains of cattle that grazed low-endophyte ‘Kentucky 31,’ ‘HM4,’ or ‘MaxQ’ were similar (P &#62; 0.05). Subsequent finishing gains were similar (P &#62; 0.05) among fescue cultivars in 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014; however, steers that previously grazed high-endophyte ‘Kentucky 31’ had greater (P &#62; 0.05) finishing gains than those that had grazed ‘HM4’ or ‘MaxQ’ in 2010 and greater (P &#60; 0.05) finishing gains than those that grazed low-endophyte ‘Kentucky 31’ or ‘HM4’ in 2011. Supplementation of grazing steers with DDG supported a higher stocking rate and resulted in greater (P &#60; 0.05) grazing gain, gain/a, and overall daily gain and reduced the amount of fertilizer needed by providing approximately 60 lb/a, 50 lb/a, 50 lb/a, 30 lb/a, 40 lb/a, and 40 lb/a of nitrogen (N) in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, primarily from urine of grazing cattle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Thirty-six steers grazing smooth bromegrass pastures were used to evaluate the effects of a supplemental energy source on available forage, grazing gains, subsequent finishing gains, and carcass characteristics. Supplementation treatments evaluated were: no supplement, a supplement with starch as the primary source of energy, and a supplement with fat as the primary source of energy. Supplements were formulated to provide the same quantity of protein and energy per head daily. Supplementation with the starchbased or fat-based supplement during the grazing phase resulted in higher (P &#60; 0.05) grazing gains than feeding no supplement. Supplementation during the grazing phase had no effect (P &#62; 0.05) on finishing gain, feed intake, and feed:gain. Steers supplemented with the starch-based supplement had greater (P &#60; 0.05) final finishing live weight and greater (P &#60; 0.05) hot carcass weight than those that received no supplement.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identification of Yield-Limiting Factors in Southeast Kansas Cropping Systems</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sassenrath, G. F.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lin, X.</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Shoup, D. E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Crop performance and yield within production fields varies as a function of growing environment and soil properties within the field. Components contributing to yield in corn, wheat, and soybean production were examined through on-farm measurements of soil properties in southeast Kansas. Additional tests in research plots explored components contributing to yield in greater detail. Environmental variability between the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons contributed to differences in yield. Additional variability in soil parameters influenced crop performance, particularly for soils high in clay content.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>incite Change | Change insight</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Keane, Tim</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This was the theme of the Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture (CELA) 2015 National Meeting and Conference, hosted by Kansas State University, March 23 – 28, 2015. The call for papers addressing this theme noted: “When we teach, design and serve, we incite change. When we observe change it informs our insight; deepening our understanding, broadening application of acts, processes, representations and the results of creating difference. How do you incite change? How do you change insight? Our CELA 2015 theme and questions might appear dichotomous or formulaic given the conventions of printed text but we perceive the words and ideas as constantly cyclic and representing a single construct rather than opposite sides of the coin.
This document contains accepted, peer-reviewed papers which address the theme: incite Change| Change insight within the teaching, creative inquiry, research, outreach, and practice of landscape architecture, its allied arts and sciences. Each paper presented was reviewed by experts in the respective area of concern and authors of accepted papers worked with the editor to revise and re-submit their manuscripts. The final products of this rigorous, blind, peer review process are presented here. This document represents a beginning, a change in the development of the discourse on creative inquiry within the discipline of landscape architecture. The papers suggest that this discipline may indeed be changing in how it teaches, researches, and serves its students and its larger community of concern. It is our hope that future CELA conferences continue the practice of a “special conference theme publication”. We also hope that the papers presented here change insight, and incite change. The editor and the authors welcome your feedback and inquiries.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Materializing through the Skylight</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Charney, Wayne Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Whether or not any structure built for a world&#39;s fair can ever hope to aspire to any sort of enduring architectural significance that extends well beyond the short life span of the exposition for which it was built is a question that has already been much debated and perhaps settled in the affirmative especially for some of the more visually exciting and experimental contemporary exhibition pavilions.</dc:description>
