			<dc:title>Feasibility of Brief Hospital-Based Interventions for Postpartum Depression : Effects on Depressive Symptoms, Perceived Support, &#38; Treatment Utilization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Abboud, Sabra N.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is estimated that 10-20% of childbearing women develop postpartum depression (PPD), affecting up to 400,000 women in the United States each year. As many an 82% of women diagnosed with PPD decline recommended treatment, primarily due to a lack of knowledge about PPD, to societal stigma and to practical barriers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large-scale study examining the impact of screening measures and a supportive approach immediately postpartum on utilization of recommended care, levels of depression and perceived social support. Women were randomly assigned (N=40) on a maternity unit to one of four conditions. 1) treatment as usual (control), 2) PPD screening, 3) problem-solving support, and 4) PPD screening and problem-solving support. The three experimental groups also received brief education regarding depression and treatment effectiveness. A post-test at eight weeks postpartum involved a PPD screen, social support questionnaire, life events questionnaire and brief interview to assess utilization of care. An ANCOVA was used to assess whether or not treatment had an effect on screening scores, perceived support and recent life events after controlling for income as a covariate. Results indicated no significant differences between treatment and screen scores, perceived support or recent life events. Positive associations between income and social support scores and negative associations between income and recent life events were observed, suggesting that women of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to experience negative life events and perceive their support as being less adequate. Four women (10%) utilized treatment; of these four, two initiated antidepressants and had a history of treatment for depression. No significant differences were noted between the women who utilized treatment and the overall sample. Denial of treatment was related to fatigue, feeling overwhelmed and beliefs countering treatment. A model supporting the use of a standardized PPD brochure, routine screening immediately postpartum and at early pediatrician visits, prenatal education for both parents, home visits, and the use of a staff psychologist to treat postpartum women in a supportive environment through continuity of care is suggested. In addition, it is suggested that the results of this study be used to generate a second feasibility study utilizing the suggestions provided in this study. The results of a second feasibility study could be used to obtain funding for a large-scale study with adequate power, which could be used to support legislation to fund the proposed model.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Differential Diagnosis of Late Onset Psychosis Using Neuropsychological Assessment and Neuroimaging Techniques</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ball, Susan Fralick</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Few references in the literature have been made with respect to the diagnosis of late onset psychosis by the use of behavioral observations coupled with neuropsychological and neuroimaging techniques. This is a report of the case of a 68-year-old woman who experienced a sudden onset of psychotic illness characterized by delusions and confabulation. As part of her neurobehavioral evaluation, a SPECT scan revealed right frontal and left anterior temporal lobe hypoperfusion. Serial neuropsychological evaluations demonstrated decline on tests of executive control (monitoring, allocation of attention, perseveration) and visuospatial abilities, whereas performance in other areas of cognitive functioning remained close to the normal range for the patient&#39;s age and educational level. Over the same period of time MRI and neurological examinations were within normal limits. Thus, there was little evidence to diagnose dementia. The patient did not have a fundamental disorder of thinking or profound deterioration in mental or social functioning, so a diagnosis of late life onset schizophrenia was not made. It is suggested that impairment in executive control with a diminished capacity to process perceptual information can give rise to psychotic behavior characterized by late onset psychosis. The review of the literature provides a nosology for late onset psychosis, which follows a succinct neuroanatomical review of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe function found to be involved with the psychotic underpinnings of the disorder. This work culminates with a research study wherein specific neuropsychological and neuroirnaging tests sensitive to late onset psychosis would be delivered to three elderly cohort groups to aid in early detection and differential diagnosis of late onset psychosis. It is expected that proficiency on neuropsychological tests sensitive to visuospatial organization will be compromised for individuals having late onset psychosis. It is also expected that these individuals will demonstrate a low total score on a neuropsychiatric inventory scale. It is postulated that MRI will demonstrate subcortical white matter intensities not found in late life onset schizophrenia or frontotemporal dementia. Additionally, it is hypothesized that the SPECT scan of individuals having late onset psychosis will demonstrate hypoperfusion to the right frontal, right parietal, and anterior left temporal regions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Normative Study of the Mahan and DiTomasso Anger Scale</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Beardmore, Roger Oliver</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study proposed to advance the treatment of anger disorders by exploring the psychometric properties of the MAD-AS scale, an anger assessment tool. Research sought to build on prior investigation of the reliability, validity, and factor structure of the MAD-AS in an inpatient setting by examining this measure using outpatient subjects. Several important findings were obtained in this study. Research results suggest that the MAD-AS represents a significant improvement over some existing anger measures in terms of its brevity, its ease of administration, and its standardization of scoring. The MAD-AS appears to possess sound psychometric properties in terms of its reliability and validity. Findings indicate that the MAD-AS scales reflect the multidimensional quality of anger, measuring anger&#39;s cognitive, physiological, and behavioral components. These characteristics suggest its potential usefulness in diverse settings. The MAD-AS may function in research contexts as a valuable aid in the screening of participants. In clinical work, the MAD-AS can assist in identifying symptoms, choosing interventions, monitoring treatment, and evaluating outcomes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Case Study of a Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for the Problem of Marital Division of Labor</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bollinger, Lily Woo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This clinical dissertation concerns an evaluation of a Cognitive-Behavioral Marital Therapy intervention designed to help resolve the issue of division of household labor and thereby increase marital satisfaction. There were six ninety-minute group marital sessions. There were 3 couples in the group. The sessions contained interventions to increase communication skills, problem-solving skills and raise empathy for the spouse who did more chores. The case study couple&#39;s score indicated that the husband had a higher level of marital satisfaction. The wife&#39;s final score indicated a small increase in marital satisfaction. Both had an increased score in being more self-centered.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Attributional Style and Sleep Disturbance in Combat Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bova, Marian</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study investigated attributional style, i.e., locus of control, stability, and globality, as well as other causes of sleep disturbance in combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The causes of sleep disturbance which were studied included restlessness/agitation, mental overactivity, consequences of poor sleep, and lack of sleep readiness. A case-control group design (N = 100) compared combat veterans who had PTSD (n = 50) with a group of similar-aged men who did not have PTSD (n 50). SPSS 10.0 was used to conduct all analyses. MANOVAs (a= .05) were used to analyze results. Findings suggested that combat veterans with PTSD have a pessimistic attributional style for hypothesized bad events that is internal, stable, and global. Combat veterans had significantly stronger stable and global attributes, as well as more restlessness, agitation and mental overactivity that they identified as interfering with sleep. Combat veterans had considerably less concern about the consequences of poor sleep. Groups did not differ on lack of sleep readiness. Results suggested that routine clinical treatment might include attributional retraining to modify combat veterans&#39; pessimistic attributional style and cognitive restructuring to lower the mental anxiety associated with restlessness, agitation, and mental overactivity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Predictive Nature of Commitment Language in Relation to Outcome of Prolonged Exposure Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brinen, Aaron P.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sessions of prolonged exposure therapy, an extensively studied treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder, were coded for client verbalization in favor of maintaining or changing the focal behavior of the treatment. The frequency of client verbalization was used to attempt discrimination of group membership based on treatment completion and diagnosis remission. Client language was not predictive of group membership. However, for treatment completers, average frequency of verbalization against the status quo was twice as high as noncompleters when reviewing common reactions experienced following a trauma. Implications for treatment conceptualization and delivery are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship between Self-Reported Weight Management and Perceived Norms of Weight Management in Scholastic Wrestlers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Camaerei, Sara J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Wrestling is unique in that it is the only sport that requires opponents to be matched by weight. Because two athletes at an almost equal weight compete against each other, wrestlers participate at the lowest weight class possible, which frequently leads wrestlers to engage in unhealthy and dangerous weight loss practices. Social norms theory suggests that much of an individual&#39;s behavior is influenced by perceptions of how members of a social group think and act. If these perceptions are inaccurate, and over-estimates of the unhealthy behaviors of others occur, an individual is likely to engage in such behaviors himself. One hundred and twenty-eight wrestlers from northeastern Pennsylvania public high schools completed a number of surveys about their weight management practices and their perception of their teammates&#39; weight management practices. Principal-Component factor analyses were utilized to identify common factors that explain the pattern of correlations within the set of variables. Bivariate correlations and subsequent Paired-sample T-tests and independent T -tests were utilized to compare factor dimensions. As expected, this study demonstrated that scholastic wrestlers do utilize health-relevant weight management and perceive that their teammates engage in such behaviors as well.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploratory Factor Analysis of a Relational Aggression Self-report</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carlson, Kimberly S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Relational aggression (RA) represents a distinct form of bullying and refers to behaviors that harm others through damaging their friendships, their inclusion in social groups, and their feelings of acceptance. RA has been recognized as a significant problem, which has psychosocial and academic consequences for perpetrators, victims and bystanders. This study evaluated a self-report inventory that examined RA in 219 females ages 10 through 18 from Central Pennsylvania. Inter-item correlations revealed that none of the scale’s items were highly correlated and therefore repetitive. An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with an oblique rotation was used to identify the factors within the Girls Relationship Scale. Two factors were revealed with a “lenient” alpha greater than .70, representing the factors of “Relationships” and “Substance Abuse.” A Pearson Correlational analysis found a significant negative relationship between the Age and the Substance Abuse factor (Pearson Correlation= -.166, p=.001), indicating the fact that older girls were more likely to endorse the willingness to smoke cigarettes or use drugs or alcohol if meant being accepted by other girls. A significant correlation was also found between the Age and the Total Scale score (Pearson Correlation= .495, p=.001), indicating that older girls were more likely to answer questions in a more self-assured and knowledgeable manner, or in the desired direction. An ANOVA revealed significant differences between the roles involved in relational aggression including the “bully”, “victim”, “bystander” or “other”, and the “Relationships” factor (p=.002) and between the roles and the Total Scale score (p=.001). Post hoc tests to examine the significant differences further could not be performed, however, because of missing data caused by subjects not answering every question. Lack of significance was found between places and situations in which girls think that they have more problems with their relationships and their ethnic heritage and the factor and Total scale scores.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of the Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP) for use with an American Substance Abuse Population</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Barbieri, Hannelore T.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Multi-dimensional instruments in the addiction field developed in the United States as well as in other countries are limited. The Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP), a brief, multi-dimensional instrument developed in the United Kingdom (UK), is designed to assess the treatment outcome of individuals with alcohol and/or drug (AOD) problems and associated issues. This measure consists of sixty items across the domains of substance use, health risk, physical/ psychological health and personal/social functioning. The MAP, which has been validated on British as well as on several European samples of substance abusers, has been suggested for further validation. The current study was designed to examine the psychometric features of the MAP on a sample of American AOD users. Subjects included 133 patients who had been admitted for treatment in an inpatient psychiatric hospital; they had been identified with a recent substance abuse history. Seven interviewers were trained to criterion; 90 percent agreement with the investigator was achieved. The test-retest reliability of the MAP was good (average concordance of 0.96 across eight substances and 0.77 across health risk, health symptoms, and personal/social functioning). The interrater reliability among seven interviewers (one researcher and six clinicians) was also good (coefficients across eight substances were 0.95 and 0.78 across problem areas). The Pearson Correlation Coefficients of physical/psychological health symptoms between US and UK samples ranged between r = 0.97 and r = 0.98. Correlations among problem areas indicate several significant interactions between substance use and problem areas. Overall, the present study has shown that the MAP is a reliable outcome measure with several distinct advantages; it is an instrument which can be recommended for use in the US.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Clinical Treatment Provider Attitudes Toward Sexual Offender Management within an Outpatient Treatment Center : Treatment Provider Attitude Survey</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Barabas, Dustan A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study&#39;s foundation is based on research suggesting that the attitudes of clinicians regarding their clients have profound effects on therapeutic alliances, empathy, and staff burnouts, which may contribute to treatment barriers. Because professionally appropriate behavior often conceals stigma, misconceptions, and negative feelings that clinicians may have toward sexual offenders, an anonymous survey of attitudes, job burnout, and empathy was conducted in an outpatient setting. The survey instruments tap into some latent factors concerning the attitudes of clinicians, their perceptions of burnout, and their abilities to empathize with their clients. This research focused on describing a population of clinicians who work with sexual offenders in an outpatient setting in Pennsylvania. In this study, using anonymous surveys, data was collected from clinical staff who work with sexual offenders. Each packet of surveys contained a demographics questionnaire, a survey developed for this study entitled, Attitudes Regarding Sexual Offenders, the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Using SPSS statistical software, frequency distributions and item percentages were calculated for each of the survey question as a descriptive measure of this population. The results are descriptive in nature of the staff at this particular agency. Significant finding are presented and treatment implications are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Older Adults and Depression : the Relationships Between Distorted Thinking, Quality of Life and Depressive Themes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ferguson, Carissa Y.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study analyzed the relationships between depression, distorted thinking and quality of life in an elderly population. Ninety non-depressed and 72 depressed individuals were interviewed and administered 3 self report measures. The study results demonstrate that: (a) Those who reported greater numbers of cognitive distortions, reported lower quality of life than those who reported less cognitive distortions; (b) depressed individuals reported lower quality of life than non-depressed individuals; (c) depressed individuals endorsed more distorted thinking phrases than non-depressed individuals and (d) depressed individuals reported more subcategories of cognitive distortions than nondepressed individuals. The results of this study support the ideas that depressed older adults exhibit more distorted thinking and have a lower quality of  life than the non-depressed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Suicidal Behavior in Incarcerated Men in the Pennysylvania Department of Corrections</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Estadt, Gregory John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Suicide is a well-documented problem, ranking high in causes of death in the US and internationally. National and international programs have been designed to address the problem, as well as approaches targeting prison populations. Within these programs, knowledge of local risk factors is viewed as essential in identifying potential suicide completers. The current study expands existing knowledge of these risk factors in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections by a) collecting descriptive data of completers and b) conducting a retrospective case control study. The descriptive data is utilized to create a profile of typical suicide completers in the PA DOC. The case control study is useful in distinguishing characteristics associated uniquely with completers and attempter relative to controls. The case control summary is also useful in identifying characteristics that distinguish suicide attempters and suicide completers from each other. Finally, a screening instrument is developed based on findings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Anxiety Sensitivity : Validity of the Anxiety Sensitivity Profile on a Clinical Sample</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Elwell, Sharon V.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The psychometric properties of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) have been criticized. Although it has been the gold standard in research and assessment, its reliability (i.e., internal consistency) has been questioned. There are doubts about its ability to identify accurately the underlying factors for anxiety sensitivity. To provide a more accurate description of the anxiety sensitivity construct, Taylor and Cox (1998) developed the Anxiety Sensitivity Profile (ASP) and performed analyses based on a sample of 349 university students. The current study utilized a clinical sample to test the hypotheses that the ASP would have convergent validity with the ASI and discriminant validity with the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAl). This correlational study was conducted with a clinical sample of 105 adults, 19 to 65 years old, who have an anxiety disorder. Each subject completed the ASP, ASI, STAl, and the computerized version of the SClD-I/P. Results supported the hypotheses. Large correlations at the .01 level were found for the ASP and ASI total scores and ASP subscale scores. Modest correlations were found for the ASI and ASP total and subscale scores and the trait version of the STAl at the .05 level. Reliability (internal consistency) for the ASI total scores and ASP subscales was high. Therefore this study provides evidence for convergent validity with the ASI. It also provides necessary, although not sufficient evidence for construct validity for the ASP subscales. Internal consistency reliability cannot be determined for all of the underlying domains of the ASI, because one of the domains consists of only one item. This evidence implies that the ASP is psychometrically superior to the ASI for research and treatment. Instead of the three underlying factors of the ASI, six factors are implied. Evidence is provided through convergent validity and internal consistency reliability found for the six ASP subscales. It is speculated that utilization of the ASP will support improved consistency in research through the use of congruence (i.e., matching the symptoms caused by a provocation task and the symptoms a person fears). Furthermore the ASP will support accurate identification of the domains underlying anxiety sensitivity that contribute to its association with all anxiety disorders. Finally, there are applied implications. These include the fact that those at risk can be identified and given brief cognitive-behavioral therapy as a preventive intervention. Also, treatment can target congruent cognitions, and elevated anxiety sensitivity at the end of treatment can be targeted for further interventions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development and Validation of a Scale of Perceived Control Across Multiple Domains</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davis, Beth Arburn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The importance of perceived control in people&#39;s lives is vast. Indeed, there is much research to support the notion that the perception of control is as important, if not more important, than actual control. This idea can be instrumental in therapy. Patients may have a sense of control in one area, but not in another, and this may cause problems for them. It is likely that an understanding of how much control they believe they have could help patients in therapy. This study outlined the historical and research aspects of the constructs of control and of perceived control, its general importance and its importance in therapy, as well as in psychopathologies where control is an issue, in the multiple terms for the construct, the manner in which it was defined for this study, and the process of the development and validation of a scale of perceived control in multiple domains: the Perceived Control Across Domains Scale. The results of this study suggest that participants could not differentiate between cognitive and behavioral items, that perceived control in this study emerged as six factors consisting of 17 items, and that perceived control differed between genders in the areas of food intake, influence on environment, and aggression.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Psychometric Study of the Mahan and DiTomasso Anger Scale (MAD-AS) in an Outpatient Cardiac Sample</dc:title>
<dc:creator>D&#39;Andrea, Kimberly S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Psychometric evaluation of the Mahan and DiTomasso Anger Survey (MAD-AS) analysis in an outpatient cardiac population is herein described. The MAD-AS is a newer instrument that measures the cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of anger and is beneficial in that it is brief. One hundred fifty cardiac outpatients and one hundred fifty non-cardiac dental patients were administered a demographic form that requested information about cardiac risk factors, the MAD-AS, and the STAXI-2, a widely used valid and reliable measure of state and trait constructs of anger. The MAD-AS factor structure, construct validity, internal consistency, and reliability were examined and found to support the instrument. Group differences were hypothesized to exist in regards to anger; these differences were not statistically significant. However, when age and several risk factors were controlled for, group differences were detected in the expected trajectory in MAD-AS scores but not in STAXI-2 scores. The results described in this study support the reliability and validity of the MAD-AS.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Community Integration and Normalization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cunningham, Janice Eileen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Utilizing archived data for 650 individuals, psychosocial variables were examined to elucidate the effect of deinstitutionalization on success of community integration. Deinstitutionalization has been blamed for a host of societal ills including the burgeoning homeless population and for overcrowding in prisons. Many claim that deinstitutionalization has failed and that the chronically severely mentally ill have not become part of their communities. Utilizing extant data on consumers released from Pennsylvania state hospitals as part of a unique initiative, the psychosocial variables of age, race, gender, length of institutionalization, placement following hospitalization and diagnosis were correlated with homelessness, incarceration, or whereabouts known to measure rate of community integration. Of all living consumers released under this initiative, 97% are living in the community.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Everyday Magic : A Depressed Mother&#39;s Guide</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Coulson-Brown, Diana</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this dissertation project was threefold: to develop a cognitive-behavioral manual for therapists, a self-help manual for depressed mothers, and a guide to assist children, aged 6 to 11, through the risks of depression was paramount in the design of this project. Given a paradigm shift in the field of psychotherapy towards resilience, this manual is timely in that it is a valuable resource for promoting resilience outcomes in both mothers and their children. This manual includes a variety of social, emotional, and behavioral activities for mothers and children, allowing mothers to be at the forefront of establishing their children&#39;s resilience by first empowering themselves with a healthy cognitive mindset.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship Between Self-Reported Lifestyle Habits, Social Support, and Physiological Factors Associated with Hypertension : A Biopsychosocial Investigation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chiumento, Deborah A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The relationship between hypertension and related biological, psychological, and social variables among patients diagnosed with hypertension was investigated utilizing the biopsychosocial model. Fifty-four participants from one outpatient private medical office were administered a demographic form, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Health Adherence Behavior Inventory (HABIT), the Inventory for Cognitive Distortions (ICD), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results indicated that the participants&#39; use of caffeine positively correlated with their high blood pressure readings. In addition, participants who reported having significant social support engaged in more health promoting behaviors. These findings were consistent with the hypotheses. Limitations of this research and directions for further research are discussed. These findings may have indications for primary care physicians, as they may better understand factors related to hypertension.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessing Mental Health Literacy of First- and Third-Year Medical Students : Knowledge and Beliefs About Mental Disorders</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cheslock, Patricia A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mental health literacy is the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that influence their identification, treatment, and prevention. It is highly pertinent for the primary care physician to possess appropriate mental health literacy, because it is in that sector that the majority of individuals first seek treatment. As many as 90% of individuals who experience symptoms of a mental disorder are first seen by their primary care physician. However, general practitioners often do not detect or diagnose the presence of a mental disorder, and as many as 50% of these disorders remain unidentified and untreated. This study explored the mental health literacy of first-year and third-year medical students to assess their knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders. Medical students were required to read vignettes describing an individual who was experiencing symptoms of &#34;stress&#34; or a &#34;mental disorder,&#34; and to indicate a diagnosis. It was hypothesized that: a) third-year medical students would have a significantly greater number of accurate diagnoses; b) the male-gendered vignettes would be significantly underdiagnosed by first-year-medical students; c) the female-gendered vignette describing stress would be significantly overdiagnosed as a mental disorder by first-verses third-year medical students; and d) third-year medical students would report significantly less mental health stigma. Results of this study found evidence that third-year medical students were better able to accurately diagnose a mental disorder as compared to first-year medical students after reading a vignette that described an individual experiencing symptoms of a mental disorder. The male-gendered vignettes were not significantly underdiagnosed by first-verses third-year medical students, and the female-gendered vignette depicting stress was not significantly overdiagnosed as a mental disorder by first-verses third-year medical students. Third-year medical students overdiagnosed the female-gendered stress vignette, while first-year medical students &#34;underdiagnosed&#34; the female-gendered generalized anxiety disorder vignette. The use of vignettes that describe individuals with symptoms of mental disorders appears to be a valid and reliable method of assessing mental health literacy. In addition, agreements and statistically significant differences are reported regarding prognosis, stigma, and the helpfulness of various interventions. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Becoming Visible : A Qualitative Analysis of Female to Male Transsexuals&#39; Coming Out Experiences</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chernicoff, Emily R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research explores the coming-out processes of 11 transgendered individuals who underwent female-to-male sex reassignment. Its purpose is to expand upon the cultural literacy of clinicians called upon to support transgendered clients who present with the intent to transition. The thesis is predicated on the argument that the differently-gendered constitute an understudied and discrete cultural minority, similar to ethnic, racial and sexual minorities, for whom identity formation is similarly impacted by socio-cultural influences.  Qualitative content analysis of transcribed semi-structured interviews was conducted. Phase analysis was found to parallel both Cass&#39;s 1979 stage-model theory of sexual minority identity formation, and Devor&#39;s 2001 stage model of transsexual identity development, with minor variation. Grounded theory building revealed a 4-part coming-out process: (a) an Intrapsychic phase, (b) an Interpersonal/Interactive phase, (c) an Arrival phase, and (d) an Integrative phase Which, by report, uniformly resulted in a heightened quality of life for all participants. The author concludes that the overridingly positive outcomes are attributable to early parent-child attachment and the increase in ego strength conferred by sex and gender congruency, suggesting avenues for future investigation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Resiliency Factors: Predictors of Quality of Life in Family Caregivers of Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chakraborty, Beatrice Hamblin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease resulting from generalized degeneration of motor cells in the brain and spinal cord (The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association [ALSA], 2004). Also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, ALS has no conclusive etiology, no known cure, and death generally occurs within three to five years following the diagnosis (Rabkin, Wagner, &#38; Del Bene, 2000). Given the devastating and predictable course of ALS, it is understandable that this disease can have a profound, adverse impact on the quality of life (QOL) of the patient and the caregiver. However, not all caregivers, particularly spouses who assume the primary care for patients with ALS, perceive the experience of caregiving as a profound burden (Miller &#38; Lawton, 1997). In fact, some ALS caregivers appear to be psychologically resilient to the stress associated with caregiving, and even endorse satisfaction with their QOL. Yet the protective factors, or resiliency variables, that contribute to ALS caregivers’ positive QOL are largely unexplored in empirical research. This is a cross-sectional study, and data generated by ALS caregivers using the following measures were collected: Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS), State Hope Scale (SHS), Life Orientation Test – Revised (LOT-R), Social Problem Solving Inventory – Revised: Short (SPSI-R: S), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life – Brief Form (WHOQOL-BREF). The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Hope, optimism, social problem solving abilities, relationship satisfaction, and religiosity/spirituality will be significant predictors of the quality of life for caregivers of patients with ALS. (2) Positive problem orientation and rational problem solving skills will be positively correlated with the relationship satisfaction of spousal caregivers of patients with ALS. (3) ALS caregivers’ religiosity/spirituality will be positively correlated with caregivers’ state hope and dispositional optimism (i.e., positive life orientation). Analyses of the data collected from the sample participants (n = 58) are at least preliminarily consistent with prior research suggesting that there are some significant inter-construct relationships between the independent variables. This study supports the notion that clinicians can identify at-risk caregivers early in the caregiving experience, in order to engage these caregivers in appropriate interventions designed to enhance their quality of life and the quality of life of patients living with ALS. Limitations of the study and clinical implications of the development of the ALS Caregiver Resiliency Training, an intervention model, are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship Between Social Problem-Solving Skills, Quality of Life, and Family Adjustment in Caregivers of Children with Developmental Disability</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fisher, Bonita Ellen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study focused on the relationship between a caregiver&#39;s problem solving skills, their perceived quality of life, their family&#39;s adjustment to their child&#39;s disability, and the potential for mediation of those relationships by the child&#39;s behavior. A total of 111 parents completed the Social Problem Solving Skills Inventory-Revised, short form (SPSI-R:S), the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment, brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), the Family Impact of Childhood Disability Scale (FlCD), the Nisonger Child Behavior rating Form (NCBRF) and a demographics questionnaire.  Analyses of the data by Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient identified significant correlations between scores on the problem orientation components of the SPSI-R:S) and quality of life (QOL) scores on the WHOQOL-BREF domains. Scores in all four domains (psychological, social, environmental, and physical) demonstrated positive correlation with Positive Problem Orientation (PPO), and negative correlation with Negative Problem Orientation (NPO).  Of the problem solving styles, scores on both Rational Problem Solving (RPS) and Impulsive/Careless Style (ICS) demonstrated small correlations (positive and negative, respectively) with scores on only one - the psychological - domain of the WHOQOL-BREF. Scores on Avoidant Style (AS) were negatively correlated with three of the four WHOQOL-BREF domains: physical, psychological, and environmental.  There were no significant correlations between problem orientations and scores on the FICD. Of the problem solving style scores, only Impulsive/Careless style (ICS) scores were correlated with FICD (positive subscale scores, in the negative direction). There were no correlations between any problem solving scores (orientation or style) and negative subscale scores of the FICD. There was no mediation by the child&#39;s behavior, as measured by scores on the NCBRF, in any of the correlations found. Scores on the Problem Behavior scale of the NCBRF were indeed correlated with QOL scores, but were independent of the other correlations.  Problem-solving interventions may contribute to an increase of quality of life in parents of children with developmental disability.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comprehensive Profile of Adult Outpatient Psychotherapy Treatment Responders, Nonresponders, and Negative Responders in a Naturalistic Treatment Setting</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Genieser-DeRosa, Anya</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Since its inception, the effectiveness of psychotherapy as a treatment for psychological distress has been challenged vigorously. During the past 5 decades, increasingly sophisticated research studies have demonstrated psychotherapy effective in treating a variety ofpsychological disorders in the majority of individuals who avail themselves of treatment. Moreover, despite fierce competition among proponents of various psychotherapy models attempting to prove their model of choice most effective, research findings suggest the major models of psychotherapy are all equally effective in treating most individuals. Some have therefore shifted their research focus to determining the factors common to major psychotherapies that promote treatment success. Few, however, have examined the contributing factors involved in treatment failure. The present study investigates the factors predictive of treatment nonresponse (failure to change significantly from baseline global functioning, as a measure of overall functional psychological status) and negative response (deterioration from baseline global functioning) in a large sample of adult (ages 18-65) psychotherapy outpatients treated in naturalistic settings. Predictor variables were selected and drawn from archival questionnaire data monitoring changes in 900 patients&#39; functioning in several specific and one global domain. The patient sample was randomly divided into two groups. Scores of Group 1 on predictors were submitted to a discriminant function analysis, and a predictive model for treatment outcome group classification was successfully derived. The veracity of the model was then substantiated with the data of participants assigned to Group 2. Results indicated that the linear combination of patient&#39;s scores on specific predictor variables successfully predicted the assignment of patients to one of three discrete outcome groups treatment responder, treatment nonresponder, and negative treatment responder. Findings suggest a small group of individuals is at high risk for negative treatment response. Others are highly likely to improve during treatment; however, an equal number are likely to experience no significant change during the treatment process. Further investigation into the risk factors involved in treatment nonresponse and negative response is key to a complete understanding of this phenomenon, to creating a method for the early identification of those at risk, and to developing specific interventions to increase the rate of treatment success in those at risk of experiencing suboptimal treatment outcome.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Psychometric Development and Validation of the Zahn-Given Recovery Beliefs Questionnaire in an Adult Psychiatric Sample</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Given, Dennis R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the Zahn-Given Recovery Beliefs Questionnaire (RBQ). The RBQ is a formal measure designed to assess specific underlying beliefs and expectations that relate to treatment non-adherence and recidivism in adult psychiatric patients. A total of 100 subjects were administered the RBQ, the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS); included as well are self and clinician-rated compliance with treatment measures. Factor analysis of the RBQ reveals a factor structure that includes four factors: Embarrassment/ Stigma, Unrealistic Optimism, Hopelessness/ Pessimism and Concerns About Side Effects. A total scale alpha reliability of .82 indicates stability of the instrument. The RBQ demonstrates construct validity as evidenced by positive correlations with the BHS and DAS, which also measure distorted styles of thinking. Furthermore, the Pessimism/ Hopelessness factor of the RBQ correlates positively with the BHS. Recidivists (n = 31) did not significantly differ from non-recidivists (n = 69) on total RBQ score, although non-recidivists endorsed more concerns related to the use of psychiatric medications as measured by the Concerns About Side Effects Factor of the RBQ. Treatment implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Retrospective Comparison of One-time Inpatient Mental Health Admissions to Readmissions : a Look at Managed Care</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goldenberg, Stuart R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study retrospectively reviewed 2,753 members from a managed behavioral health care organization who experienced at least one psychiatric inpatient hospitalization between July 1, 2003 and December 31, 2004. Demographic and clinical variables were examined in an effort to distinguish the factors that were present between members treated with one hospitalization versus members who required re-hospitalization. Readmission for the present study was defined as a psychiatric re-hospitalization within a 180 day timeframe. Particular focus included analyzing the variables of length of treatment, age groups, presence of a psychotic disorder, history of inpatient treatment, and managed care account funding types. The sample set of the present study was randomly split into two groups for the purpose of replication. Similar results were found between the two sample sets. When comparing psychiatric readmissions to one-time admissions, there were significant differences between longer and shorter lengths of treatment, between members with psychotic disorders versus non-psychotic disorders, and between members with and without a previous inpatient hospitalization. Findings indicated that a member, who experienced either a long length of treatment, the presence of a psychotic disorder, or a history of previous hospitalizations, was more likely to experience an inpatient psychiatric readmission. No significant differences were found between the comparable age groups of children and adults to adolescents and older adults, nor account types of non-risk accounts to full-risk accounts.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Integration of Spirituality and Cognitive-behavioral Therapy for the Treatment of Depression</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Good, Jennifer J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental health problem that is treated by many mental health practitioners. Cognitive-behavioral therapies have proven to be effective in helping restructure the cognitions of the client, which in turn reduces depressive symptom. Research has shown that individuals with MDD who value spirituality tend to view the world in a different way than those individuals that do not hold spirituality as an important value in their life. Spiritual individuals have religious schemas, and therefore, it would be important to incorporate spirituality into the treatment setting. This pilot study utilized a manualized treatment approach that focuses on spiritual growth and decreasing depression through a spiritually informed cognitive-behavioral approach (SICBT).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analysis of the Goodwin Sentence Completion Test in the Screening of Clinical Depression</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goodwin-Tribble, Karyn L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Goodwin Sentence Completion Test (GSCT) was developed as a screening instrument for clinical depression. This instrument, composed of 25 sentence stems, was designed to indicate the level depression and to assess the strength of negative perceptions associated with dimensions of the cognitive triad (self, world, and future). Although the GSCT follows the typical format of most projective sentence completion tests, an objective scoring method was also constructed in order to evaluate more reliably individual results. The tool was administered to 80 adult volunteers ranging in age from 18 to 72 years of age. Volunteers were randomly selected from a variety of public and private settings and represented diverse cultural, socio-economic, and educational backgrounds. Participant scores from the GSCT were compared with scores gleaned from the second edition of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDI). Results supported the primary hypothesis, which predicted statistical significance and a positive correlation between GSCT scores and scores from the BDI-II and HDI tests. As anticipated, the investigation also highlighted the strength of any negative or depressive attributes related to self-based, world-based, and future-based perceptions evaluated through GSCT subtest items. Further analyses also found a positive correlation between the aforementioned GSCT subtest items, the BDI-II, HDI, and the HDI Melancholia Subscale.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Retrospective Investigation of One-time Presenters Versus Repeat Presenters to Urban and Suburban Psychiatric Emergency Services : Cross-sectional and Clinical Characteristics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hansen, April J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study retrospectively reviewed 765 patients who presented within a one-year period at either a suburban, urban, or both suburban and urban psychiatric emergency services (PES). Demographic and clinical characteristics were examined. Particular focus included characteristics of children/adolescents and older adults, as well as the relationship between substance misuse and PES presenters. Adults presenting to PES more than three times were more likely to have a chronic mental illness, personality disorder, history of psychiatric treatment, and a history of noncompliance with treatment than those who presented three times or less. Significant differences were found between urban and suburban PESs, in that adults presenting to only the suburban PES were more likely to be employed. Children/adolescents who presented to PES multiple times were more likely to have a history of psychiatric treatment than children/adolescents who had presented one time. No significant differences that were predicted were found between older adults who presented to PES multiple times and older adults who presented to PES one time. Adults who re-presented to PES within 30 days of being discharged from PES were less likely to have social and economic problems. Adults with comorbid diagnosis of substance abuse and psychosis were more likely to visit PES more than one time within a year. Adults who presented to PES with a diagnosis of primary substance abuse without a chronic mental illness were more likely to be self-referred and discharged to the community.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Substance Abuse Severity, Treatment Motivation, and Criminal Thinking Factors : Predictors of Treatment Retention with Substance Abusing Parolees in a Correctional Aftercare Program</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Henkel, Loretta Joan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Substance abuse and substance dependence are complex disorders that affect millions of people in the United States. Two notable consequences of these disorders are increased criminality and higher rates of recidivism. This archival data study of 94 parolees admitted to the Day Reporting Center, Volunteers of America Delaware Valley in Camden, New Jersey examined the influence of substance abuse severity, of treatment motivation, and of criminal thinking factors on treatment retention in a correctional aftercare treatment program for parolees with a history of substance abuse or dependence. The extent to which parolees were deceptive in reporting information was also examined.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Does Social Problem-solving Moderate the Relationship Between Physical Functioning and Depression in ALS Patients?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Horowitz, Melissa Dillon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease, is a progressive and ultimately fatal neurological disease that interferes with the normative functions of the upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Depression has been found across disease stages in some ALS patients, but not all. Investigations that examined the association between physical functioning and depression in ALS patients produced mixed findings. To date, the role of social problem solving has not yet been explored in the ALS population. Thus, the current study examined the relationship between social problem solving, physical functioning, and depression in ALS patients. A total of 71 ALS patients participated in the study. The ALS patients were administered the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revise, Manual Muscle Test, Brief Symptom Inventory 18, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressed Mood Scale, and the Social Problem-Solving Inventory - Revised Short. Data were analyzed using two separate correlations and one multiple regression. Results from the current study concluded: (a) clinically significant levels of depression were found in 15 - 32.3% of the ALS subjects, (b) there was a positive correlation between poor social problem solving skills and depression, (c) there was a small correlation between poor physical functioning and depression, (d) bulbar functioning was not correlated with depression, and (e) negative problem orientation predicted 26.8% of the total variance for depression. Overall, the results from this investigation demonstrated negative problem orientation not physical function was a predictor of higher levels of depression in ALS patients. The implication from this study suggests that empirically supported treatment approaches such as problem-solving therapy may reduce depression in ALS patients.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Understanding Countertransference with Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder : an Exploratory Quantitative Investigation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hunt, Michelle Saxen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study surveyed 58 psychologists regarding their countertransference (CT) behaviors, CT management ability, empathy, and working alliances when treating patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Common positive and negative CT behaviors were identified when treating their typical patient with BPD. As predicted, results yielded negative correlations between therapists&#39; CT behaviors and their CT management ability, working alliance, and empathy, as well as a positive correlation between therapists&#39; CT management and working alliance, linking CT management to positive treatment outcomes. Therapists&#39; level of experience and theoretical orientation were also examined, finding no significant impact on CT behaviors, CT management, or working alliance. Implications for training and supervision of therapists treating patients with BPD, suggestions for future research, and limitations of the study are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Analysis of Demographic Variables and Levels of Stress in Law Enforcement Officers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jansen, Kathleen M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Employment in a law enforcement profession exposes an individual to potential stressors not experienced in most other professions. Sporadic efforts have been made to design stress management programs to assist officers in coping with the demands of their jobs. Much of the previous research on law enforcement stress has focused on examining the effectiveness of various coping skills; however, the training has focused on teaching a healthy lifestyle. This study seeks to add to the existing research by examining what elements of the job are perceived as the most stressful and what demographic variables, if any, may influence an individual&#39;s perception of work-related stress.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship of Coping and Social Support to Depression, Perceived Pain, and Health-related Outcomes in Post-surgical Coronary Bypass Grafting Patients</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kovacs, Theresa A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research proposal highlights the potential outcomes: post-surgical CABG patients with little or no positive coping methods will reflect signiflcant levels of depression, pain and lower HRQL scores and that post-surgical CABG with low levels of social support will show significant levels of depression, pain and lower HRQL scores. This research will also define and clarify the interrelationships between these mechanisms that affect the recovery process in CABG patients. Furthermore this research wiIl help to identify a clinical need for treatment in CABG patients that would reduce further cardiac complications and ultimately reduce overall health related costs. This proposal will identify any demographic information (age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and race) that has an influence in this population and any implications for future outcomes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Enhancing Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Hispanic/Latino Clients with Depression : Recommendations for Culturally Sensitive Practice</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kuneman, Elizabeth Suarez</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Using a qualitative approach, this study explored the process of developing treatment suggestions for adding cultural sensitivity to an empirically supported, group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment manual for Hispanic/Latino clients with depression. Suggestions were formulated through the implementation of one vignette centered on a male character, addressing Hispanic/Latino cultural values as described in the literature. This researcher sought bilingual mental health providers (English-Spanish/Spanish-English) who worked with Hispanic/Latino clients; four from a group of ten who responded, reviewed the researcher’s suggestions and answered a seven item semi-structured questionnaire, which was developed to elicit their comments. Analysis of the data revealed themes that endorsed the importance of addressing traditional cultural values when serving these clients, including familismo, dichos, fe, social and family network, gender role expectations, and stigma associated with mental health services. Implications for clinical practice, limitations of the study, and recommendations for future research were discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Examining Cultural Competence Among Osteopathic Medical Students</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Sooni</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the growing number of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, there also has been a rise in health disparities. Ethnic minorities have been experiencing an overabundance of medical issues, particularly chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Although these chronic diseases are preventable, ethnic minorities are at greater risk for death from them. Possible contributing factors to the increase in health disparities include limited medical attention and follow-up appointments with physicians and the physician-patient relationship. The purpose of this study was twofold: to examine cultural competence among osteopathic medical students and to examine their attitudes toward cultural competence training while in medical school. The results do not suggest a significant difference between Group A, first and second year medical students, and Group B, third and fourth year medical students on the level of cultural awareness and sensitivity and cultural competence behaviors. Additionally, all 4 years of medical students endorsed the importance of learning cultural competence training while in medical school.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Role of Motivation to Change on Treatment Outcome in Individuals with Anorexia Nervosa</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Link, Darlene Davis</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study investigated motivation to change as a factor in the treatment of Anorexia Nervosa. This study was conducted at The Renfrew Center with 44 adults diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa who were entering their inpatient program. The participants were evaluated at intake and discharge on variables of motivation to change, eating disordered symptom severity, weight change, and compliance with treatment. As predicted, results revealed significant negative correlations between the patient&#39;s level of readiness to change at admission and perfectionism, distrust of others and their severity of anorexic symptoms at discharge. In addition, the results confirmed that the patient&#39;s level of readiness to change at admission could predict the patient&#39;s severity of anorexic symptoms at discharge. However, there was no significant relationship found between readiness to change and weight during treatment. Additionally, level of readiness to change at admission was examined by comparing patients with a previous hospitalization and patients on their first hospitalization, finding no significant difference. Implications for treatment of patient&#39;s with anorexia nervosa, suggestions for future research and limitations of this study are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Norming the MAD-AS to the STAXI-2 in a Hypertensive Population</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Liskowicz, Robert J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Development of the Mahan and DiTomasso Anger Scale (MAD-AS) provided a valid and preferable alternative to the existing, lengthy tests of anger which are currently available. However, the MAD-AS was developed on a clinical, psychiatric population, and only one other study to date has attempted to utilize this test on a normal population. With strong links between anger and adverse physical health, and an ongoing controversy over whether anger expression versus anger suppression contributes more highly to the development and maintenance of hypertension, a prospective study measuring anger with established hypertensive subjects is being proposed utilizing both the MAD-AS, as an experimental instrument, and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory - 2 (STAXI-2), as an established instrument. This study hopes to lend not only more validity to the MAD-AS with a medical population, but also more evidence to the above controversy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Diabetes is a chronic illness that currently has no cure. Quality of life can be improved by the person’s own adherence to treatment and motivation to manage their diabetes. Both of these factors are difficult maintain and access to patient education materials is limited. This study developed an Internet-based disease management program for people with diabetes. This diabetes disease management program followed the PRECEDE health program planning model. Focus groups and key informant interviews people with diabetes were run in order to obtain feedback for this program. Cognitive-behavioral and health behavior change theory were integrated in to the program to increase self-efficacy and treatment adherence.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present study attempted to empirically identify symptoms of bipolar disorder to define a more accurate clinical description. A group of 30 individuals with a formal diagnosis of bipolar disorder, who had joined a support group as outpatients, a comparison group of 30 individuals with unipolar depression from an outpatient support group, and 30 nonpatient adults were administered identical measures of symptoms. Results suggested that individuals with bipolar disorder endorsed symptoms correlated with paranoia to a greater degree than individuals with unipolar disorder or nonpatient adults. In addition, symptoms of hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, global severity and psychoticism, as defined by the SCL-90-R, were prominent features to a significant degree when compared with nonpatient adults. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Predicting Institutional Adjustment with the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles and the Psychopathology Checklist : Screening Version</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mandell, Wanda</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This correlational study investigates the incremental validity of the Reactive (R) composite scale of the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS) relative to Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) total score for predicting medium security federal adult male inmate adjustment over a 12 month period. Adjustment, the criterion variable, was operationalized as the number of incident reports received over 12 months. Archival data for 146 offenders were obtained for incident reports and categorized as aggressive or non-aggressive. Scores for the PICTS P and R composite scales were obtained from archival electronic files. Data for rating the PCL:SV were gathered from each inmate’s presentencing investigation file. Two statistical models were employed for analyzing the eight hypotheses of this study. The first model included the traditional linear correlation and logistic regression analyses. The second model, which included univariate and multivariate negative binomial regression analyses, was implemented to specifically address the unique qualities of the distribution of the criterion variable. In the preliminary part of this correlational investigation, five demographic variables (age, education level, ethnic status, marital status, type of confining offense) and two psychometric variables and selected subscales (PCL:SV total, Part I and Part II scales and the PICTS P and R scales) were assessed to determine their relationships with the criterion variable. The primary hypothesis investigated incremental validity between the PCL:SV total score and the PICTS R composite scale. The findings using the two statistical models indicated that the logistic regression provided limited findings; however, the negative binomial regression, which in addition to replicating the findings of the logistic regression model, found additional significant findings. The primary hypothesis was partially supported in that significant incremental validity was found for the PCL:SV total score and the PICTS R composite scale for total incident reports, however not beyond age.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Anger and Social Problem Solving Style as Predictors of Burnout in Mental Health Workers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Maroney, Jerri L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examined how the variables of anger and social problem-solving style affect the dimensions of burnout in a sample of 99 mental health workers. To assess these constructs, the State-Trait Anger Scale-2, and the Social Problem Solving Inventory-Revised were utilized. The Maslach Burnout Inventory for Human Services Staff was used to measure job burnout. Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and a decrease in the sense of Personal Accomplishment are the core dimensions of burnout on this measure. Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization correlated significantly with State Anger, Trait Anger, and Negative Problem Orientation. Significant inverse correlations were demonstrated for State Anger, Trait Anger, Negative Problem Orientation, and the burnout component of Personal Accomplishment. Hierarchical multiple regression indicated that Trait Anger predicted a significant amount of the variance in Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization. Positive Problem Orientation also accounted for a significant amount of the variance in Depersonalization. Negative Problem Orientation was predictive of Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment. State Anger and Rational Problem-Solving Style also explained a significant amount of variance in Personal Accomplishment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploratory Study of Anger and Behavior in an Incarcerated Offender Population Utilizing the Mahan and DiTomasso Anger Scale</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Marsh, Jr., Robert John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study proposed to advance the treatment and assessment of anger disorders by exploring the properties of the Mahan and DiTomasso Anger Scale (MAD-AS). Previous research of the reliability, validity, and factor structure of the MAD-AS was conducted with inpatient (Mahan, 2001) and outpatient participants (Beardmore, 2003) . In the present study a psychometric investigation was undertaken utilizing 300 male incarcerated offenders. The MAD-AS correlated positively with the presence of antisocial and borderline personality disorders and with violent offenses. Those inmates with a history of violent offenses scored significantly higher than those convicted of nonviolent offenses on the MAD-AS. The MAD-AS possessed sound psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity. Results indicated the MAD-AS reflects the multidimensional quality of anger including its cognitive, physiological, and behavioral components. In clinical forensic work the MAD-AS may assist in identifying dynamic criminogenic needs, selecting interventions to address those needs, monitoring treatment outcomes, and assessing risk factors for recidivism.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparison of Self- and Significant Other-rated Expression of Anger Using the MAD-AS and the SO-MAD-AS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Martin, Donna Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study proposed to advance the treatment of anger disorders by exploring the psychometric properties of the MAD-AS scale, an anger assessment tool. Research sought to build on prior investigation of the reliability, validity, and factor structure of the MAD-AS in an inpatient setting by examining this measure using outpatient subjects. Several important findings were obtained in this study. Research results suggest that the MAD-AS represents a significant improvement over some existing anger measures in terms of its brevity, ease of administration, and standardization of scoring. The MAD-AS appears to possess sound psychometric properties in terms of its reliability and validity. Findings indicate that the MAD-AS scales reflect the multidimensional quality of anger, measuring anger&#39;s cognitive, physiological, and behavioral components. These characteristics suggest its potential usefulness in diverse settings. The MAD-AS may function in research contexts as a valuable aid in the screening of participants. In clinical work, the MAD-AS can assist in identifying symptoms, choosing interventions, monitoring treatment, and evaluating outcomes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Perceived Control and Locus of Control in Active Duty Military Members : a Comparison of Late Enrolees with Early Enrolees</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Montgomery, Lori J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study compared perceived control and locus of control in two groups of reservists with prior active duty military service. Those who served on active duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard were eligible to participate. The subjects were obtained from a Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center where there are over 600 reservists and 24 units available. These reservists are representative of the Navy and Marine Corps reserve population, with the exception of naval aviation. Research has increased during the past decade regarding military culture and dynamics; however, little is known about the effects of military service on perceived control or locus of control. This study focused on these two aspects of cognitive style among prior active duty members. The hypotheses in summation are that early enrollees (those who entered military service immediately following high school) have lower perceived control and an external locus of control. This study utilized two measures to obtain data, the Spheres of Control-3 (SOC-3) and the Perceived Control Across Domains Scale (PCADS). The study did not reveal significant findings between perceived control or locus of control as it relates to time of entry into military service. However, significant findings were found in this sample between the PCADS and the SOC-3. Strong negative correlations appear to exist between these two measures indicating that as perceived control increases, individuals in this population are likely to have an internal locus of control. It appears that there is some overlap between the constructs of perceived control and locus of control.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Feasibility Study of an Intervention Designed to Create Cooperative Communication for Couples: a Sociolinguistic Approach to Cognitive Behavioral Couple Therapy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Morand, Lee Wood</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Researchers and clinicians recognize relationship distress as one of the most frequently presented problems in psychotherapy. Relationships themselves depend on language and sociolinguistic skills. However, despite the passionate interest and relevance imparted to success in relationships, little attention is paid to sociolinguistic skills. This study is an evaluation of a feasibility study designed as a couple’s communication program. Overcoming communication problems and improving marital satisfaction is the intent of this program. The design of this program is to overcome communication problems and improve marital satisfaction. Cooperative communication is the framework for the communication skills training. One voluntary couple participated in this pilot study. The study utilized a 55-page treatment workbook designed to increase sociolinguistic skills and gender difference awareness. The workbook employed the seminal works of Immanuel Kant, H. P. Grice, and Deborah Tannen. The brief intervention consisted of 11 sessions over a period of 9 consecutive weeks. Each session used a cognitive-behavioral theoretical orientation. The rationale of this study was to promote cooperative communication between individuals within a couple’s therapy milieu. This cognitive-behavioral couple therapy (CBCT) intervention focused on improving sociolinguistic skills and increasing couple satisfaction.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship between Discontinuation of Anti-depressant Medication During Pregnancy and Development of Postpartum Depression</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Murphy, Maria Palombo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious and potentially debilitating disorder that frequently goes undetected due to stigma and a lack of understanding about its course and etiology. The factor of particular interest to this study concerns the relationship between discontinuation of anti-depressant medication in pregnancy and the development of PPD. The study examined how the variables of pregnancy mood, child care stress, emotional support, instrumental support, marital satisfaction, history of depression, baby temperament, birth experience, and medication status affect symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) in a sample of 202 patients at the six-week postpartum check-up. In addition to a demographic and mood questionnaire, the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) was used to measure symptoms of postpartum depression. Prenatal depression, child care stress, history of depression, baby temperament, and birth experience correlated significantly with PPD. Significant inverse correlations were found between PPD and emotional support, instrumental support, marital satisfaction, and medication status. Hierarchical multiple regression indicated that pregnancy mood, child care stress, emotional support, and marital satisfaction predicted a significant amount of the variance in postpartum depression scores.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development and Validation of an Instrument to Predict Non-adherence to Medical Treatment Regimens</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Parke, Dorothy E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Evaluation of the Health Adherence Behavior Inventory (HABIT) is described with data pertaining to reliability and validity. The instrument was originally developed for use in a primary healthcare setting, to support the early identification of patients who are at risk for poor health outcomes and complications of chronic disease because of non-adherence to their healthcare provider’s instructions. The items were refined from the original HABIT (DiTomasso, 1997) and drawn from various sources, including health risk assessments, health screening questionnaires, and nationally accepted standards for disease treatment and prevention. The questionnaire consists of 50 items, 39 of which appear to load on one factor. Items were analyzed, revealing two clusters, which yielded one Main Factor (Prevention Factor). This factor represents positive health behaviors that have demonstrated a correlation with reduced risk for negative health outcomes. These behaviors address one domain of the multifaceted problem referred to as non-adherence.  With respect to construct validity, the questionnaire correlated significantly with the widely used and reliable Health Risk Assessment developed by Lifestyle Directions, Inc. The strong correlation with an established Health Risk Assessment suggests promise for further refinement of the scale, offering a briefer alternative to full risk assessment. Through additional research, it is anticipated that a more comprehensive set of questions may uncover other key domains that offer valuable insight into the prevention and the treatment of non-adherence.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Does Alcoholics Anonymous Participation Decrease Learned Helplessness and Increase Self-efficacy?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pellegrino, Philip John</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has long been the major treatment of choice in the United States for individuals with alcohol related problems. Research on AA has had methodological problems and there is no clear evidence that AA in and of itself is effective in treating alcohol problems. Treatment studies on alcohol and substance users have found that abstinence self-efficacy and approach coping skills have been related to improved drinking outcomes. Also, depression and alcohol problems have been shown to be highly correlated with each other. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between participation in AA and improvements in abstinence self-efficacy, learned helplessness, and depression. One hundred and four individuals who enrolled in inpatient treatment for alcohol dependence were assessed at admission for depression, self-efficacy, learned helplessness, and alcohol-related problems. These were also assessed at end of treatment and 2 month follow-up along with participation in AA. Minimal findings were found for the impact of AA on any psychosocial variables.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Power of the Mind : the Relationship between Mindfulness, Quality of Life and Anxiety for Older Adults with Chronic Illness</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ransom, Tracy Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation examines the relationship between mindfulness training and older adults with chronic illness and a documented clinical anxiety diagnosis. Six subjects (mean age = 69 years) who met criteria for a DSM-IV-TR anxiety condition and who endorsed one or more chronic illnesses participated in an 8-week customized mindfulness training program. The research evaluated the impact of mindfulness training and practice on depression, quality of life, health satisfaction and anxiety. This dissertation&#39;s findings suggest that of these variables, state and trait anxiety were significantly reduced at the conclusion of the program. Given these findings, this research proposes that anxiety in older adults with chronic illness can be reduced by utilizing a mindfulness-based therapy program specifically tailored for the older adult.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship Between Cognitive Distortions and Psychological Disorders Across Diagnostic Axes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rosenfield, Bradley Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was twofold: First, the study sought to determine whether or not cognitive distortions correlated with the number and severity of psychological disorders across diagnostic axes. Second, the study endeavored to assess further the validity and reliability of a promising new self-report measure, The Inventory of Cognitive Distortions (ICD), by correlating this instrument with clinical diagnoses as determined by the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III. The sample was selected from a heterogeneous adult outpatient population. Participants meeting inclusion criteria presented for psychological treatment or assessment. Excluded were participants who had less than an eighth grade education, or who met diagnostic criteria for a number of neurological disorders. The study was correlational in design. Results supported the reliability and validity of the ICD as an assessment instrument measuring cognitive distortions, because the ICD determined that approximately half of the variance in both the number and severity of psychological dysfunction, on both Axis I and Axis II, was accounted for by the frequency of cognitive distortions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Adult Attachment Disturbances in Panic Disorder : a Comparison with Social Phobia and Specific Phobia</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Salas, Jesus A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study used attachment theory as a framework to explore the role of attachment related constructs as potential risk factors for panic disorder. A group of panic disordered participants were compared with a group of social phobics, a group of specific phobics (fearful flyers), and a group of nonclinical controls. The groups were compared on attachment dimensions, fear of emotions, fear of bodily changes, death attitudes, information processing style and self-efficacy. Results indicated that the panic disorder group and control group differed in a number ofways. Panic disordered participants evidenced higher levels of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance than control participants. Also, the panic group reported lower social and generalized self-efficacy, and greater fear of losing emotional control than the control group. In addition, the panic group reported higher fear of death and of bodily changes than the control group. Finally, panic disordered participants indicated using less rational strategies when coping under stress. Social phobics presented no significantly different levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance than panic disordered participants. Also, no significant differences were found between the panic disorder and the social phobia groups regarding their perceived levels of social and generalized self-efficacy. The two groups significantly differed on fear of death and of bodily changes: the panic group evidenced higher levels than the social phobia group. The specific phobia group was most similar to the control group, except for their higher fear of death and of bodily changes. In addition, the associations between the different constructs were also studied. Results are broadly consistent with attachment theory in that attachment disturbances are not exclusive to panic disorder. Findings suggest that distinct combined influenced of the variables are associated with the different disorders. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed in relation to current conceptual, research and clinical issues in panic disorder theory and attachment theory.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Addressing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy During the Informed Consent Process : the Licensed Psychologists&#39; Perspectives</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sarkozy, Neshe</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This survey study investigated attitudes and practices of 161 licensed psychologists from a nationwide sample, relative to addressing negative effects of psychotherapy during the informed consent process. Results revealed discrepancies in attitudes toward risk of negative treatment effects in psychotherapy and in addressing risk during the process of informed consent. Information obtained from this study may contribute to research in the area of clinical implementation of the American Psychological Association’s Code of Ethics. Implications for clinical practice are discussed. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are also addressed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Impact of Participation in a Cognitive-behavioral Substance Abuse program on Recividism</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Spates, Kristen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study utilizes archival data from a cognitive-behavioral substance abuse program for offenders. Substance abuse often is linked to criminal involvement and it was expected that treatment of substance abuse problems would result in a decline in recidivism. The study includes all adult male offenders who completed the Offender Substance Abuse Prerelease Program (OSAPP) through Volunteers of America, from January of 2001 through September of 2003. Participants are described in terms of their severity of substance abuse problems and risk of recidivism. It was expected that differences in program participation, as measured by changes from pre test to posttest measures and facilitator ratings, would be predictive of recidivism within a two year follow-up period. However, the study&#39;s hypotheses were not confirmed and relationships between program participation and recidivism were not discovered.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Examination of Health Adherence Behaviors and Cognitive Distortions in Patients with Chronic Illness</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stankiewicz, Clint C.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The relationship between health adherence behaviors and cognitive distortions among patients with chronic illness were investigated. One-hundred eleven participants from two outpatient medical clinics were administered the Health Adherence Behavior Inventory (HABIT) and the Inventory for Cognitive Distortions (lCD), and the Health Adherence Behavior Survey was utilized to obtain demographic information. Results indicated participants who had a thinking style characterized by the use of cognitive distortions tended to engage in fewer health promoting behaviors. This finding was consistent with the predicted hypothesis. In fact, a significant correlation at the .05 level of -.173 was found between the ICD and the HABIT. These findings suggest that cognitive theory may have utility in understanding and improving health adherence. These findings have implications for primary care, as health care providers will be better able to manage and understand factors related to nonadherence, opening the door for collaboration among medical and mental health care providers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Perception of Control and Awareness of Deficit in Individuals with Neurological Impairment in a Clinical Sample</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Struck, Donna Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Acquired brain injury is considered to be one of the most important public health concerns in the United States, with approximately 1.2 million adults that meet the criteria for chronic brain disease, brain disorder, or injury each year. Medical costs directly related to injury, in addition to the indirect costs related to job loss, totaled an estimated 60 billion dollars in the year 2000. Subsequent impairment following brain injury yields a complicated neurobehavioral sequelae of deficits. Anosognosia, specifically, the deficit of the patient&#39;s inability to acknowledge, or even recognize impairments, is common following brain injury. In a review of the literature, this study examined the phenomenon of anosognosia, and its relationship to an individual&#39;s perception of control. Both the Perception of Control Across Domains Scale (PCADS) and the Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) were utilized as a measure of self-report, and compared with the patient&#39;s test scores on standardized neuropsychological measures. Findings concluded that patients do not reliably report their symptoms. Although the study&#39;s findings revealed no significant correlations, implications for the field of psychology are still useful. The rising costs of healthcare have contributed to the problem of insurance companies attempting to eliminate the coverage for neuropsychological testing, in favor of conducting a clinical interview. These findings suggest that clinicians cannot rely solely on patient report to determine an accurate diagnosis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The author has developed a gentle, sensitive philosophy of care for the Osteopathic practitioner.  The practitioner is to use manipulation while at the same time, keeping uppermost in the mind, the gentle dignity and self-healing energies of the organ in question.  Set in 1908, this book wants the Osteopathic community to remember that each person whether practitioner or patient, is the master of mind, energy and matter.  If one follows this philosophy, Mr. Hoffman says, “microbes will have no power to cause disease”.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploration into the Beliefs about Paternal Roles : The Development of the Beliefs about Paternal Roles Inventory</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bocchicchio, Anthony M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The aim of this study was to design and validate a self-report inventory of beliefs about paternal roles as expressed by mothers and fathers. A random sample of parents (N = 103) was administered the Beliefs about Paternal Roles – Initial Version to assess its psychometric properties. Results showed positive psychometric properties for 4 (Affection &#38; Emotion, Engagement, Family, and Physical Well-Being) of the 12 proposed domains of paternal roles. Acceptable levels of internal consistency reliability were demonstrated for these four domains by the coefficient alpha of .84. A factor analysis of these four domains yielded a factor that says that paternal roles are basically viewed as direct involvement with children. The study supports the idea that different and distinct behaviors do comprise direct involvement. Areas of future research include continued development of the inventory with diverse populations and further testing of its psychometric properties.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Psychometric Investigation of the Validity and Reliability of the Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire-Revised in a Sample of Psychotic Outpatients</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Blue, John James</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Refractory auditory hallucinations are a continuing problem in the treatment of schizophrenic, schizoaffective and psychotically depressed patient populations as well as patients with psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified. To date, little is known about the assessment of such hallucinatory states. Currently there are only a few instruments designed to examine the characteristics of auditory hallucinations. The study examined the reliability and validity of the Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R) in a sample of psychotic outpatients experiencing refractory auditory hallucinations. The present study consisted of 91 subjects; 57 men and 34 women selected from four separate community outpatient settings, who experienced active auditory hallucinations for at least 5 years. The subjects ranged between age 25-50 years of age and were represented by the following ethnic groups: White: 82 subjects, (90.1 %); African American: 7 subjects, (7.7%) and Hispanic: 2 subjects, (2.2%). The sample included: (1) patients who were experiencing both active benevolent and malevolent hallucinations and patients who were experiencing only malevolent hallucinations; (2) those diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria (APA, 1994) with schizophrenia (63.7%), schizoaffective disorder, (24.2%), and psychotic depression, (12.1%) and (3) those considered refractory defined as chronic and drug resistant and corroborated by their treating psychiatrist. Number of self reported hospitalizations ranged from 4-60. Exclusion criteria included those patients suffering from either a drug or alcohol induced psychosis and/or dementia. The goals of this study were: (1) To better define the construct being measured by the Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R) through correlation with measures of anxiety, depression and hopelessness; (2) to test the internal consistency of the content of the Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R); and (3) to study the properties of the BAVQ-R and its constructvalidity and reliability. Measures included the Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-R (BAVQ-R); Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II); Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The present study provides support for the validity and reliability of the BAVQ-R suggesting that it measures constructs that are potentially useful and relevant to understanding and treating patients suffering from chronic refractory hallucinations. The measure is a valid and reliable one with the sub-scale scores being stable and measuring homogenous constructs. The BAVQ-R exhibits test-retest reliability and internal consistency reliability. Test-retest reliability is lower than coefficient alpha. There is support for this measure&#39;s construct validity. These subscales correlate with measures of emotional distress. Coefficient Alpha reliabilities were calculated with alpha values ranging from .75 to .88. Corrected item subscale total score correlations were calculated and found to be significant at p &#60; .01. The findings of this study are theoretically consistent with Chadwick&#39;s theoretical underpinnings, except that there was no statistical relationship observed between the Benevolent subscale of the BAVQ-R and the BAl. The results of this study have some interesting implications for treatment of patients suffering from refractory auditory hallucinations. In the current study a very high correlation was found between the BAVQ-R subscales of malevolence and omnipotence and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The researchers found a statistically significant positive correlation between the scores on the Malevolence sub-scale of the BAVQ-R and the BDI-II (r = .605, p &#60; .01). As scores on the Malevolent sub-scale increased subjects evidenced higher scores on the BDI-II. In support of hypothesis 2 the correlation between the Omnipotence sub-scale and the BDI -II was .565, (p &#60; .01) suggesting that the more the subjects attributed power and omnipotence to the hallucination, the more depression the subject reported. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the Malevolent sub-scale of the BAVQ-R and the BAI (r = .458, p &#60; .01) suggesting that the more malevolent the subjects hallucination the higher was the subject&#39;s anxiety level. There was also a statistically significant positive correlation (r =.461, p. &#60; .01) between the Omnipotence sub-scale and the BAI suggesting that the more power and omnipotence that was attributed to the hallucination, the more anxious the subject was. In support of our third hypothesis there was a statistically significant positive correlation observed between the Malevolence sub-scale of the BAVQ-R and the BHS (r = .450, p &#60; .01) suggesting that the more malevolent a subject&#39;s hallucination the higher the subject&#39;s endorsement of hopelessness items on the BHS. There was an inverse correlation between the Benevolence sub-scale and the BHS (r = -.319, p &#60; .01) which also supported our third hypothesis suggesting that the more benevolent the subject&#39;s hallucinations the lower the scores on the BHS. Again in support of the third hypothesis there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the Omnipotence sub-scale and the BHS (r =.387, p &#60; .01) suggesting that the more omnipotent subjects rated their hallucination, the higher the endorsement of hopelessness items on the BHS. It is important to note that the relationships between administration 2 of the BAVQ-R and the Beck measures replicated those observed on administration 1. There appears to be some higher order factor on this scale having to do with aversive hallucinatory experience and pleasurable hallucinatory experience. Those who would score high on the aversive factor might be more likely to comply with a treatment modality that would remove the hallucination and lessen their discomfort. On the other hand, those patients high on the pleasurable factor might be less likely to comply since they do not see their hallucination as distressing. Utilization of the BAVQ-R in the assessment of hallucinatory states may be effective in alerting clinicians&#39; to those patients who may represent potential treatment resistance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Rehabilitation after Brain Injury : Identifying Predictors throughout Post Acute Rehabilitation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bond, Elisabeth L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional outcomes of clients who received post-acute rehabilitation services following a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in an effort to identify predictors affecting outcome. An archival database was used to study three different outcome measure ratings over two and or three consecutive time periods. There were 105 participants, 82 male, 23 female, 87 residential and 18 outpatient, who were 19-78 years of age. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted within subjects to identify changes across time. No significant changes were found. A between subjects MANOVA was conducted to study relationships between preexisting characteristics prior to injury, injury characteristics, placement and gender with outcome measures. A significant relationship was found between the type of placement and outcome measures of ability and participation (F = 2.18, p = &#60; .01), suggesting the appropriate placement of persons with TBI given the greater level of impairment experienced. Outpatient participants were found to have more adjustment problems than those in residential care, suggesting a different experience of mood symptoms and adjustment issues. A significant relationship was found between the DRS 8 (Employability) item and age at admission, (F = 4.28, p = &#60; .01) suggesting that those in the age group 29 – 38 years are deemed to have greater employability. In conclusion, although there were no significant findings for other preexisting characteristics, longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the outcome measures and possible predictors of outcome.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessment of Risk and Protective Factors for Homelessness : Preliminary Validation of the Life Needs Inventory</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brown-Young, Dena L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study was to examine the LNI (Life Needs Inventory), used by the VOADV (Volunteers of America Delaware Valley) organization to identify risk factors, as well as protective strengths, associated with the securing of stable housing among the homeless population. Homelessness is a growing concern in the United States (Rosenberg, Solarz, &#38; Bailey, 1991) and individuals or families who become homeless are at risk for many more problems. Finding suitable shelter is just the beginning, as physical safety and mental health issues become major concerns. Violence, drugs, risky sexual behaviors, lack of social support, limited employment opportunities, financial instability, and mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, antisocial personality, post traumatic stress, as well as substance use, only add to the problems of homelessness. All of these issues, and more, must be considered when planning psychotherapeutic treatment for clients living in temporary shelters or transitional housing facilities. It is essential for the VOADV to have a valid and reliable instrument with which to assess the risk factors associated with homelessness, as well as to measure the impact of protective factors on homeless individuals, because these factors relate to the securing of stable housing. This study attempts to begin the validation process of the LNI.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Factors in Relapse among Physicians in Recovery from Substance Dependence Disorders</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gable, Gregory K.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examines factors in relapse to alcohol and drug dependence among health professionals, seeking to identify relationships between identified conditions and relapse. The subjects are 100 health professionals, 84 male and 16 female, randomly selected from a cohort of 308, who provided data in a previous study taking place between 1995 and 1998. These subjects were broken into two groups, relapse vs. no relapse at 5 years after participation in the original study, the post-marketing survey on tramadol (Knisely J, Campbell E, Dawson K, Schnoll S, 2002). Archival data from the previous study was used. Chart review and analysis of archival data were the methods of data collection. Data were analyzed using chi-square and one-way analysis of variance tests. Presence of a comorbid personalitydisorder (Axis II) diagnosis was related to relapse (X2 = 21.418, df= 1, p&#60;.05), as was presence of a comorbid (Axis 1) psychiatric diagnosis (secondary substance use diagnoses not included) ( x: = 9.180, df = 1, p&#60;.05). The combination of a presence of both comorbid personality disorder and psychiatric (axis 1) diagnoses were related to relapse (X2 = 23.645, d:f-=l, p&#60;.05).Level of treatment comparing inpatient or residential and outpatient treatment did not provide a significant correlation. The sample appeared to be too homogeneous on this variable for meaningful companson. Additional research, empirical and qualitative, is recommended to explore the phenomenon of relapse among health professionals. Peer assistance programs are encouraged to factor psychiatric disorders including personality disorders into evaluation and treatment plans extending beyond initial treatment experience.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Patient Perceptions of Receiving Bad News : Individual Coping Styles and Receiving the Diagnosis of Cancer</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Holsinger, Kyle B.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States (CDC, 2005). Physicians who disclose the cancer diagnosis to patients are faced with limited professional training and few consensus clinical guidelines for communicating this diagnosis to their patients (Buckman, 1992; Girgis, Sanson-Fisher, &#38; Schofield, 1999). Use of guidelines for delivering bad news and tailoring the bad news message to individual patients is recommended, but it is unclear if this is followed in the medical community (Baile, Lenzi, Parker, Buckman, &#38; Cohen, 2002). The current study was conducted through a mail-in survey, of 186 surveys delivered, 111 were returned, with 100 meeting inclusion criteria. Both monitor and blunter coping styles reported satisfaction both with overall healthcare satisfaction (73% and 63% respectively) and with their physicians (76% and 74% respectively). The monitor coping style participants reported higher satisfaction levels when more information was provided, but the blunter coping style participants unexpectedly reported higher levels of satisfaction when more information was provided, countering past research that indicated less information would result in higher satisfaction. The implications of distinguishing context versus context of the guidelines are explored, and limitations and direction of future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Integrative Therapeutic Approach Combining Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Treatment of Recurrent Depression in an Adult Client</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Librizzi, III, William J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the most often diagnosed psychiatric illness worldwide, with prevalence rates indicating that as many as 25% of the population during their lifetimes will experience symptoms of MDD (Holmes, 1997). Therapies that focus on restructuring the client&#39;s cognitions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of this disorder. For some clients, however, reoccurring depressive episodes are common and symptom reduction is infrequent. The research of Worthington (1988) suggests that the highly religious client may actually see the world in a uniquely differently way than does the non-religious. These individuals utilize more religious schema and as a consequence of this distinct perspective may experience more favorable treatment outcomes when the therapeutic approach supports their strongly held religious views (Worthington, 1988; Worthington &#38; Sandage, 2001). This single case study will utilize archival data and a manualized approach that focuses on spiritual growth and symptom reduction through an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) approach. The findings of this study confirm the work of many integrative researches that suggest symptom reduction is more apparent when an integrative approach is applied rather than a non-integrative approach.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Irritable Bowel Syndrome Pain-related Behaviors and Pain Coping Strategies as Predictors of Women&#39;s Daily Activities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McCleary, Jeffrey Aaron</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of this study is to discover the predictability of women&#39;s daily activities in relation to their irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) pain-related behaviors and coping styles.  One hundred seventy-seven women participated in a national survey study using Rome II criteria. Recruitment occurred through medical and graduate students&#39; list serves at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; IBS websites; women&#39;s healthcare websites; primary care and gastroenterology practices; churches, and a community center. This survey study was conducted face-to-face and via mail-in, using the Coping Strategies Questionnaire-Revised (Hastie, Riley III, &#38; Fillingim, 2004; Riley III &#38; Robinson, 1997; Riley III &#38; Robinson, Geisser, 1999), the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (Kerns, Turk, &#38; Rudy, 1985), the Pain Behavior Questionnaire (Phillips &#38; Jahanshahl, 1986), and a Personal Characteristics Questionnaire (Kazdin, 1998a). Results of this investigation suggest that the active and passive coping strategies, in conjunction with the pain behaviors used, impact the IBS pain sufferers&#39; daily activities.

			<dc:title>Grounded Theory : Latino Mental Health Providers&#39; Perceptions of the Mental Health Beliefs of Latino Clients</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Santiago-Serrano, Marcelle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study explores the mental health beliefs of Latinos through the eyes of Latino Mental Health Providers. Many Latinos have a view of psychologists as a &#34;healer.&#34; This view was explored relative to that of the cognitive behavioral approach, which has a strong emphasis on its self-help approach to therapy. In addition to its self-help qualities, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is recognized for its effectiveness in the mental health treatment of diverse ethnic/cultural populations. However, the CBT philosophy may seem at times, to be contradictory to many Latinos&#39; beliefs that the therapist&#39;s role is as a &#34;healer.&#34; A five item semi-structured questionnaire was developed, and was used to interview nine Latino Mental Health Providers. The questionnaire was geared toward eliciting Latino Mental Health Providers&#39; beliefs, based on their therapeutic encounters with Latino clients. The goal of the study was to report collected data pertaining to the mental health beliefs of Latinos and the ways in which clinicians can use the data to bridge the gap between the mental health beliefs of Latinos and empirically based models of therapy rooted in the cognitive behavioral tradition.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Coping and Psychological Hardiness and Their Relationship to Depression in Older Adults</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schellenberg, Dianne E.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The roles of coping strategies and psychological hardiness as these affect the relationships to depression in older adults were explored in a population of older adult residents who had recently relocated to long-term-care nursing home facilities. Older adults experience many losses and subsequent stressors as a result of normal aging; therefore, the additional stress that accompanies loss of familiar surroundings and support systems and the relocation to new and unfamiliar surroundings can have a significant impact on physical and psychological well being. A total of 91 residents participated in this study. Coping abilities were evaluated in terms of social problem-solving skills (Nezu, 1999), using the Social Problem-Solving Inventory – Revised (D&#39;Zurilla, Nezu, &#38; Maydeu-Olivares, 1996). Psychological hardiness (Kobasa &#38; Maddi, 1977) was evaluated using the Personal Views Survey III-R (Maddi &#38; Khoshaba, 2001). Depression was measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage &#38; Brink, 1983). These variables were examined for the amount of variance that each contributes to depression that may be associated with the stress of relocation. Data were analyzed through correlational and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Findings suggest that psychological hardiness (PVSII-R) was the best predictor of depression, accounting for 40.3% of the variance, followed by Negative Problem Orientation (SPSI-R); stress added another 03.8% and 04.2%, respectively. Significant correlations were noted between psychological hardiness (PVSIII-R) and Positive Problem Orientation (SPSI-R) (r = .42), and hardiness (PVSIII-R) and Negative Problem Orientation (r = -.43). Evaluating newly admitted residents for coping skills and psychological hardiness and implementation of subsequent psychological interventions to address any deficits could significantly improve depressive symptoms.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Transportability of an Empirically Supported Manual for the Treatment of Depression in Community Mental Health</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shoemaker, Marcy A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Depressive Disorders impact an estimated 17.6 million Americans a year (National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, 1999). It has been found, in fact, that major depressive disorders are the predominant illnesses among the population served in the community mental health population (Bailey, 1999; Blendon &#38; Benson, 1998). Due to restrictions in funding in Medicaid and Medicare services, many mental health services have been either restricted or eliminated for the indigent population requiring treatment (Bailey, 1999). Recognizing the need for improved outpatient care for this underserved population, the NIMH increased funding to develop stronger relationships between research and clinical practice. The NIMH also concluded that the use of evidenced-based practices, especially the use of psychotherapy treatment manuals, might be helpful in the dissemination of translational research in community mental health settings (Wilson, 1995; Addis, 2002). However, empirically supported treatment manuals have been resisted in the clinical community due to fear of standardization by clinicians (Wilson, 1995; Addis, 2002). To better understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of translational research and evidenced-based practices, an empirically supported treatment manual was implemented in a community mental health center for the treatment of major depressive disorders in a single case study. The findings suggested that the client found the structured approach helpful, especially in applying the new skills to his everyday life. There were some questions pertaining to the success of the outcome of the treatment because of the variability of the data points related to the Beck Depression Inventory–II Scores. Based on anecdotal information gathered from the transcripts and from the therapist&#39;s process notes, the client felt that his depressive symptoms reduced and his quality of life improved. The client also successfully attended all sessions and completed 90% of his assigned homework activities. It is also important to note that the client and therapist maintained a strong therapeutic working relationship, which was measured by the Working Alliance-Short Form. It is proposed by this author and researcher to conduct an empirical study with a larger sample size, three interventions and a greater number of sessions to gain a greater understanding of the benefits of manual interventions in a community mental health center.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Caregivers&#39; Relationship Satisfaction and Perception of Competency as Predictors of Quality of Life for ALS Patients</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stewart Allen, Jessica</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In addition to the physiological impact of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), patients and spousal caregivers experience significant emotional and psychological reactions to the disease and its course. As there is no effective treatment and no cure for this debilitating, fatal neuromuscular disease, treatment should include psychological interventions to improve patients&#39; disease experience. External factors impacting psychological well-being of patients must be identified to allow for effective and relevant intervention. The current study examined the relationships between level of care provided to patients, caregivers&#39; relationship satisfaction, and caregivers&#39; perceived competence, and whether these factors predict patient quality of life (QOL). It was hypothesized that spousal caregivers&#39; satisfaction in their relationships with patients, as well as their competence as caregivers, would predict ALS patients&#39; QOL beyond level of care required and after various aspects of QOL (within five domains of functioning) were considered. Fifty three spousal ALS patient-caregiver dyads at a predominantly rural university hospital provided data during a multidisciplinary clinic. Caregivers completed the Dyadic Satisfaction Subscale of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), Perceived Caregiving Competence Questionnaire, and Level of Care Index. Patients completed the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL), including the Single Item Scale (MSIS) to assess subjectively rated QOL. Correlational and hierarchical multiple regression analyses did not identify a predictive relationship between the hypothesized variables, but did indicate that patients&#39; total MQOL score predicted 32.5 percent of the variance in self-reported QOL, and was the best predictor of this patient variable, as assessed by the MSIS [F (1, 47) = 24.06, p &#60; .05]. This finding suggests that patients, when asked to do so subjectively, accurately represent their QOL, as assessed more indirectly and by varied experiences. Further, QOL is more broadly defined for patients than is solely represented by the MQOL, and not largely dependent on caregivers. Additional research is needed to more accurately understand factors contributing to ALS patients&#39; QOL and means to more precisely measure this construct. Future studies should aim to identify caregiver variables that may influence patient illness experience to justify additional intervention for both members of the spousal dyad in coping with ALS.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development and Validation of a Scale of Subjective Well-being for Cambodian Refugees</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sicobo, Gertha Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This is a study of the Subjective Well-Being (SWB) of refugees from Cambodia. A correlational study design composed of questionnaires was used to assess subjective well-being in a Cambodian population in the USA. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a newly constructed Scale of Subjective Well-Being for Khmer Refugees (SSWB-KR), to be used with Cambodian refugees living in the US. The scale is a 49-item, 4-pt. Likert -Type scale that was administered to a sample of 20 Cambodian refugees in Philadelphia, PA. It was administered along with three other measures, the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &#38; Griffin, 1985), the Hopkins Symptom Checklist -25) (HSCL-25) (Mollica, Wyshak, deMameffe, Khuon, &#38; Lavelles, 1987b), the Khmer Acculturation Scale (KAS) (Lim, Heibi, Brislin, &#38; Griffin (2002). A demographics questionnaire was also administered. The SSWB-KR was validated against the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &#38; Griffin, 1985). A group of expert informants provided information that was used to create items that were classified under 11 domains of SWB. Correlations were obtained among the above scales. The SSWB-KR achieved significant positive correlations with the SWLS. No relationship was found between the SSWB-KR and the KAS. Results were also obtained for demographics and SWB. The SSWB-KR could be a useful clinical and research tool. Implications for CBT and recommendations for further validation are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessment of Anger in Persons with Cognitive Limitations : a Revision of the ADS-VII</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schmoyer, Wayne David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Assessment of angry patients with mental retardation or borderline intellectual functioning is time consuming. Existing assessment tools may be inadequate for gathering data and for guiding treatment, thus presenting a challenge for practitioners. The Anger Disorders Scale (DiGiuseppe &#38; Tafrate, 2001) samples the cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of anger. However, this scale is a self-report survey for adults of average or higher intellectual functioning. This investigation provided a feasibility test of the &#34;Anger Disorders Interview for persons diagnosed with Mental Retardation&#34; (ADIMR), a modified version of the Anger Disorders Scale designed as a clinical interview for cognitively limited patients who present with symptoms of anger. Comparisons between the ADIMR and existing assessment instruments for cognitively limited patients will be discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Link Between Executive Functioning and Teacher Referrals for Gifted Testing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kenney, Amanda Veronica</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is possible that teachers are more likely to refer for gifted support students who are highly productive in class rather than students with classroom production difficulties such as those commonly exhibited by students with ADHD or other executive function-related difficulties. Some research support has been found for this hypothesis. In a study by Zentall, Moon, Hall, and Grskovic (2001), students diagnosed with ADHD, whether identified as academically gifted or not, were described as underachievers by their teachers (Zentall et al., 2001). There can be similar behavioral characteristics between ADHD and giftedness, including hyperactivity, disruptive behavior, and a tendency to challenge authority (Leroux &#38; Levitt-Perelman, 2000). This study intended to assess teacher perceptions of the executive functioning of the students they referred for gifted testing, using the BRIEF checklist. It was suspected that students referred for gifted testing by their classroom teacher would have “better” (lower) BRIEF scores than those students not referred by their classroom teacher but who were found to have IQs in the superior to very superior range. It was hypothesized that teachers tend to refer based on “good student” behaviors such as productivity, task completion, motivation, and perseverance. This is contrary to traditional indicators of giftedness, which include creativity, higher level thinking skills, and quick processing speed. Findings supported the hypothesis because a greater number of parent-referred students were rated as having deficits in executive functioning as compared with teacher-referred students. Additionally, the brightest students were rated as having the most severe executive functioning difficulties and all were referred by parents.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessment of Teachers’ Core Beliefs Related to Key Features of Response to Intervention</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tumolo Zarabba, Jacqlyn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The   requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act require that schools are   accountable for the outcomes of all students. Response to Intervention (RtI)   provides a framework to assist in the actualization of this goal. This   educational reform effort requires dramatically different functioning on the   part of all school personnel, particularly teachers. In order for this model   to be successful, researchers must acknowledge the primacy of teacher level   factors, such as beliefs and attitudes related to core components of RtI. The   purpose of this study was to examine the core beliefs of elementary-level   teachers relative to foundational components of RtI, including service   delivery, assessment practices, core instruction, intervention, and special   education eligibility. A survey design was utilized to explore beliefs of   teachers in districts implementing RtI, compared with those who are not   implementing RtI. Results indicated that teachers in districts implementing   RtI were more likely than teachers in Non-RtI districts, to agree that using   student-based data to determine intervention effectiveness is more accurate   than using only &#34;teacher judgment.&#34; Neither group felt that core   instruction was effective enough to result in 80% of students achieving   benchmark in reading and math. Additionally, both groups felt that students   with high-incidence disabilities were not capable of achieving grade-level   benchmarks. Limitations, implications for practice, and recommendations for   future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Mindfulness-based and Cognitive-behavior Therapy for Anger-management : an Integrated Approach</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kelly, Jeffrey R.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This monograph presents an anger-management treatment manual utilizing mindfulness and cognitive-behavior approaches. This program was implemented and evaluated in accordance with Chen&#39;s (2005) recommendations for program evaluation. This study employed a single-subject design with a high-school aged individual. Post-session and post-program evaluation forms from the subject and program facilitator, along with pre- and post-program measures in the form of State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) scores, discipline records, and survey/assessment questionnaires from the parent and a teacher were obtained. The Mindfulness-Based and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anger Management program manual received positive ratings for the structure of the sessions, for the content in sessions, for the usefulness of the manual in implementing activities and exercises, and for the suggested readings indicated throughout the manual. Outcome measures for the participant suggested improvements in personal and social functioning. The current study suggests that the integration of mindfulness-based and cognitive-behavioral approaches to treat adolescents with anger-related difficulties is a promising intervention approach that warrants further research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Student Satisfaction and Program Evaluation for the First Three Psy. D. School Psychology Cohorts at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Deguffroy, Ronald M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There is a noticeable absence in the professional literature regarding what school psychology doctoral students believe leads to satisfaction during their advanced training. Consequently, a general review of available research was conducted to ascertain what other closely related fields say about student satisfaction during doctoral training. As the document progresses, a variety of issues including funding and mentoring as well as considerations for multicultural and ethical issues as they relate to the topic are investigated. A theoretical model of what constitutes a satisfying experience for doctoral training in school psychology is provided. A program specific evaluation was conducted of the first three cohorts that included survey data with the addition of semi-structured interviews also completed for cohort one. The data provides generally positive reviews of the PCOM experience within the school psychology program, although there are perceived limitations within certain aspect of the training experience that are explained. This document ends with a robust discussion that provides potential suggestions, based upon prior research and current data, for satisfaction improvement. A theoretical model of what might constitute an ideal training experience at PCOM, or other school psychology doctoral programs, is provided for consideration.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Mindfulness : Extending Treatment for Early Onset Obsessive Compulsive Disorder / Tourettes Syndrome</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Baldino, Rita L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mindfulness is a categorical name for a group of techniques borrowed from ancient Buddhist practices that teach individuals to pay attention in the present moment.  Recently, the technique has been applied successfully in several clinical populations to help individuals live with, or accept, some of the difficult-to-treat symptoms of their illnesses. This intervention study takes three specific techniques from the mindfulness literature and introduces them to a young male who had been diagnosed and has received evidence-based treatment for early onset obsessive compulsive disorder, comorbid with Tourette’s syndrome. Fourteen sessions, scheduled over eight weeks, occurred. Three measures of effectiveness were developed to gauge the ability of practicing mindfulness to relieve the individual’s depressive symptoms, a common side effect of living with an incurable disorder. The individual took a Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition before beginning the intervention, then, at two weeks, at four weeks and at eight weeks into the mindfulness practice. In addition, seven goals were created to assess the effectiveness of this intervention; five were based on clinical knowledge of the individual and two were related to the outcome research on mindfulness. The third measure of effectiveness came from the individual’s self-report data at the end of each session. Each session was predictable, practicing the same three techniques: (1). the facilitator began with a body scan; (2). the individual and the facilitator then listened to one piece of classical music; and (3). each session ended with conscious breathing. The results of this protocol are promising. This individual showed a reduction in depressive symptomology while practicing mindfulness meditation, achieved homeostasis or better on three of the five clinical and two outcome goals, and expressed personal benefit at the end of most sessions. Continued application with a young population will help to inform the practice of mindfulness with young people and will be able to bring this ancient practice into the twenty-first century classroom.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Relevance of Executive Functions in Academic Production in Middle School</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bobik, Norina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study investigated the role that executive function plays on  academic production in middle school from a prototype perspective. It  was hypothesized that middle school teachers&#39; prototypical ratings of  the executive function capacities of middle school students who are  academically successful would differ significantly from these same  middle school teachers&#39; prototypical ratings of the executive function  capacities of middle school students who are academically unsuccessful.  The study used archival data consisting of items from the Behavior  Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), a questionnaire that was  completed by middle school teachers during a professional in-service  workshop at four large urban middle schools.  The concept of academic  competence was viewed as a category, structured by the similarities of  successful middle school students to one another in discrete behavioral  manifestations of executive functions and organized around a prototype  that represents the central tendency of all the exemplars in the  category of successful students, as operationally defined by the BRIEF  items. A second prototype was structured in a similar manner for the  unsuccessful student category. To examine differences between these two  prototypical categories, t tests were conducted using T scores from the  eight BRIEF domains. It was postulated that there would be a significant  difference between the successful learner prototype and the  unsuccessful learner prototype. It was expected that the successful  student prototype would possess fewer executive function impairments  than the unsuccessful student prototype.  Statistically significant  findings were obtained, suggesting that teachers&#39; perceptions of  prototypical successful students differed from these same teachers&#39;  perceptions of prototypical unsuccessful students in their behavioral  manifestations of executive function capacities in all eight domains of  the BRIEF. Teachers&#39; ratings most consistently produced the expected  pattern of T score results for the Inhibit, Initiate, Plan/Organize,  Monitor, and Working Memory scales. Teachers were least likely to see  large differences between successful and unsuccessful students in  behaviors that reflected the executive function capacities of Shift,  Emotional Control, and Organization of Materials. The results of the  study supported the hypothesis that successful students exhibit very few  executive function difficulties, while unsuccessful students exhibit  executive function difficulties in the clinically significant range.

			<dc:title>School Refusal:Characteristics, Assessment, and Effective Treatment: A Child and Parent Perspective</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brill, Lydia D.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study, using shelf data, described a quantitative research project which attempted to propound and answer questions about the nature of school refusal in a Pennsylvania school district. The study analyzed shelf data that surveyed 40 students and parents in grades 2 through 11th who missed more than ten percent of 2007-2008 school year. Using shelf data collected by the GNA school district which consisted of parent and student surveys, this study investigated the different reasons why students refuse to attend school. Furthermore, this study also examined common characteristics found among school-refusing students in the Greater Nanticoke Area School District. Results of this study did not support previous findings of a positive correlation between parents’ permissive parenting styles and higher rates of school refusal. Although results revealed a relatively equal representation of school refusal across grades, slightly higher rates of school refusal behavior was noted among 6th grade students.

			<dc:title>Middle School Teacher Acceptance of Interventions for ADHD</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Castenova, Linda Latsko</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The study explored the relationship between middle school teacher knowledge of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), their knowledge of common interventions for ADHD, and their perception of treatment acceptability. The study also investigated teacher characteristics and their relationship to teacher knowledge of ADHD and their ratings of acceptability of interventions. Fifty-eight general education middle school teachers completed a survey containing demographic information, an ADHD knowledge scale, and a survey on interventions for students with ADHD. Results indicated that teachers scored an average of 58% correct on the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KADDS), scoring significantly higher on the Symptoms/Diagnosis subscale compared to the General Information and Treatment subscales. Most teacher characteristics were unrelated to teachers&#39; knowledge of ADHD and their ratings of acceptability of interventions.  However, teacher training was significantly related to higher knowledge scores. In terms of interventions, teachers preferred behavioral interventions (self-management and daily report) over medication monitoring for interventions for the vignette of an ADHD student without comorbid conditions. However, in more severe cases when comorbid externalizing problems were present, all interventions were considered to be equally important according to treatment acceptability ratings. Overall, fewer significant relationships were observed than predicted, suggesting that knowledge level may not be a critical variable for teachers to consider in accepting a particular treatment plan. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Biographical Study of a Woman with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum: A Story of Hope and Inspiration</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Comerford, Robin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>School psychologists must be knowledgeable about brain development to help students in their care. The human brain has the capability to determine a person&#39;s happiness, effectiveness, and positive relationships with others. This biographical study examined how a young woman diagnosed with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum (ACC) and agenesis of the cerebellum came to live a productive, happy life. ACC is a low incidence form of brain damage marked by inconsistent behavioral and emotional manifestations throughout the lifespan. Personal life artifacts, school documents, and medical records were used to help organize her life experiences in the form of a narrative biography. Through listening to her stories and that of her mother, life stages identified with key events were analyzed to help others gain insight into how she experienced her brain damage. The key events, known as epiphanies, that emerged through her life span focused upon: 1) feelings of frustration, and anger when dealing with the medical and school systems, 2) establishing secure attachment through mother and daughter connection, 3) desire for positive connections through supportive relationships to heal, 4) issues regarding educational values of competency, perseverance, and a focus on strengths, 5) issues involving advocacy for the underdog. Relational- cultural theory and resiliency research was used to analyze her stories and create a Model of Relational Resilience in Mother-Daughter Connection. Strategies and new insights into resiliency can be gleaned from this research to help school psychologists, educators, and parents be better equipped to deal with the brain injured.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Qualitative Analysis of School-based Mental Health Professionals’ Views on the Use of Self-disclosure and Humor</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Felloney, Robert</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There is some controversy in the therapeutic community over the use of therapist self-disclosure and humor. On one hand, there are those who contend that use of these therapeutic techniques can have both relational and outcome benefits. On the other hand, there are those who indicate employment of these counseling methods can interfere with the counseling process by being a distraction, as they take the focus away from the client. Relatively little research has been done on the effectiveness of utilizing these techniques, especially the use of therapeutic humor.  Review of the research shows there are relational and consequent outcome benefits of therapist self-disclosure and use of humor. Little to no research has been done on the benefits of these counseling techniques in the elementary and secondary school setting. Consequently, a qualitative research design was utilized to examine this research topic. Eight school psychologists and six school social workers from the southern New Jersey area were interviewed to obtain their opinions on the use of these counseling techniques. These school-based mental health professionals delineated both relational and outcome benefits they perceived as a result of using these methods in counseling students. Perceived relational benefits cited for both of these techniques included humanizing them in the students’ eyes and fostering a connection with students. Perceived outcome benefits cited included imparting information to students, influencing student perspectives, as well as enhancing student affect and facilitating positive behavioral change. There was also evidence that suggested there were personality/background experience variables that influenced how favorably the subjects viewed the use of these counseling strategies. None of the professionals interviewed indicated they had formal graduate training in the use of these techniques. Most of them learned about how to utilize them through training they pursued on their own or by trial and error on the job. This points to the need for more research and training on the use of these nontraditional counseling methods to augment the positive effects of therapist self-disclosure and use of humor.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Study of the Cognitive Functioning of Medicated and Non-Medicated Elementary School-Aged Children Diagnosed with Attention Deficit HyperactivIty Disorder</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Friedman, Janet</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a serious disability that has been shown to adversely affect cognition, affect, and behavior. Research using traditional measures of cognitive functioning, such as intelligence tests has shown that children diagnosed with ADHD perform poorly on cognitive measures of processing speed, and on working memory in particular (Kerns, Mclnerney &#38; Wilde, 2001; Weiler, Bernstein, Bellinger &#38; Waber, 2000). Mahone, et al. (2003), note that reviews involving the Wechsler Scales for children suggest that Full Scale IQ scores (FSIQ) on the WISC-III average 5 to 6 points lower than scores in the WISC-R. It was hypothesized that changes on revised subtests of the WISC-III Performance Scale may place ADHD children at a disadvantage if their performance on these subtests is compared to their performance on analogous WISC-R subtests. Mahone, et al. (2003) theorize that increased executive demands resulted in lower FSIQ scores and call for further analysis upon future Wechsler revisions. Although results are equivocal, research suggests that psychostimulant medication may ameliorate ADHD cognitive deficiencies that adversely impact working memory and processing speed. Brown and Borden (1989) suggest that stimulant drug improvement occurs primarily on rote or simple tasks, but measures emphasizing the processing of higher-order information may be less influenced. Barkley (1998) indicates that the impact of drugs upon behavior and concentration was most salient, with performance on intelligence tests unaffected by medication. However, most of these studies extrapolated IQ scores either from short forms or from several subtests of the Wechsler scales. Research using more traditional measures of cognitive functioning (e.g., standardized intelligence tests), and focusing on long-term effects of cognitive performance (Gillberg, et aI., 1997; Livingston, Mears, Marshall, Gray &#38; Haak, 1996; Mahone, et aI., 2003), suggests that results depend on the measures and methods used. As part of the initial validation of the revised WISC-IV, an ADHD group was compared to a matched control group. Additional research called for investigations comparing the performance of medicated ADHD children with nonmedicated ADHD children. This research used the Wechsler Intelligence Test for Children-fourth edition (WISC-IV) to assess the cognitive performance of medicated ADHD children and nonmedicated ADHD children. Results were used to answer the questions: &#34;Are there differences in IQ scores between ADHD children and normal controls, and between medicated ADHD children and nonmedicated ADHD children?&#34;</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Use of Kindergarten Screening Assessments for the Identification of At-risk Readers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gipe, Kathryn S.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Early identification of students at-risk for reading problems has become a national priority. At the present time, the most commonly used kindergarten screening methods are self-made by local districts and are not considered effective methods of early detection for at-risk readers. This retrospective study involved third, fourth and fifth grade students enrolled in a suburban elementary school during the 2007-2008 school year. The first research question examined the relationship between at-risk status determined with the Kindergarten Screening measure prior to entry into kindergarten and at-risk status determined by Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills measures administered in the fall of kindergarten. The comparison between the category classifications derived from the Kindergarten Screening Summary Scores and the category classifications derived from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills Summary Scores produced the best combination of sensitivity and specificity values. The second research question was designed to examine the predictive relationship between the Kindergarten Screening measure and the Kindergarten Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills measures with Winter Oral Reading Fluency in Grades 1 and 2. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy SkillsSummary score demonstrated greater levels of sensitivity and greater improvement over chance in predicting Grade 1 Winter Oral Reading Fluency than did the Kindergarten Screening measure for two of the three cohorts and greater sensitivity than Letter Naming Fluency or Initial Sound Fluency for all cohorts. The third research question investigated the effectiveness of the reading instruction based on the results of the Kindergarten Summary Scores, Oral Reading Fluency and Measures of Academic Performace scores. Improvements in at-risk status were noted as for Oral Reading Fluency as cohorts progressed through grades 1 and 2; this was followed by a slight decrease in grade 3, and improvements in subsequent cohorts were consistently reported. Improvement between the fall and spring Measures of Academic Performance scores was also reported for each cohort as well as with successive cohorts, suggesting positive effects of general education instruction and remedial efforts. The effect of Socioeconomic Status was investigated through re-examination of each research question, with the inclusion of Disadvantaged and Not Disadvantaged status. Results indicated that the inclusion of Socioeconomic Status is important in the prediction of at risk status, and in the investigation of effectiveness of reading instruction.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>School Psychologists&#39; Knowledge of Tourette Syndrome Characteristics and Awareness of Appropriate Interventions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Glassman, Jesse Usher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of multiple involuntary motor tics and one or more vocal tics. The duration of the disorder is at least one year and not more than three consecutive tic-free months (APA, 2000). The tics associated with TS are frequently more severe than other tic disorders on the spectrum. There are varying degrees of severity of TS disorder, requiring maximum to no treatment. Children and adolescents diagnosed and who are showing signs of TS are referred for school evaluations in order to identify various learning difficulties and /or emotional issues which are often associated with TS. More specifically, school psychologists must be knowledgeable of evaluation procedures that are conducted in order to recognize these deficits correctly. There are no formal evaluations presently required by the state of New Jersey and New York to assess school psychologists’ knowledge of TS. Additionally, New Jersey and New York do not mandate practicing school psychologists to study and become experts on this specific subject. Adequate knowledge of TS is vital for school psychologists in order to effectively implement appropriate interventions that meet the needs of TS students. The overall purpose of the study is to determine practicing school psychologists’ knowledge of the characteristics and diagnostic criteria of TS, of its associated disorders, and of its effective interventions. The study will set out to establish if these professionals are using appropriate assessments when determining intellectual, educational and emotional functioning and are making correct referrals when obtaining a TS diagnosis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploration of Specific Learning Disability Subtypes Differentiated across Cognitive, Achievement, and Emotional/behavioral Variables</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hain, Lisa A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The emphasis on the ability-achievement discrepancy approach for SLD identification diminished the importance of robust examination into patterns of cognitive strengths and weaknesses as related to achievement deficits. This approach directed attention away from related psychosocial deficits previously reported in this population by concentrating on the quantitative differences between standard scores. The cognitive and academic deficits of children with SLD have been well studied, but little is known about the emotionaVbehavioral functioning of children with SLD, and even less about the interconnections between the neurocognitive and emotional/behavioral systems. Children with disparate types of neurocognitive assets and deficits may experience learning problems specific to academic domains, and subtypes of SLD could be related to differential patterns of psychosocial adjustment. In an attempt to further the investigation of these relationships, the current study explored SLD subtypes (N = 113) through hierarchical cluster analysis ofthe WISC-IV standard subtests with emotional/behavioral functioning assessed through BASC-2 teacher ratings. Six cognitive SLD subtypes emerged, differentiated across cognitive, academic, and psychosocial variables. Statistically significant group differences were found across these variables through multivariate repeated measures MANOV A and Bonferroni post hoc analyses. The Crystallized/Language and the Executive/Working Memory subtypes demonstrated severe cognitive and academic deficits and were prone to experience global emotional/behavioral dysfunction. Two subtypes demonstrated apparent right hemisphere-based learning difficulties and were differentiated by neurocognitive assets and deficits. Although achievement difficulties were noted in math areas for both subtypes, the Fluid Reasoning subtype had additional difficulty with Reading Comprehension and more emotional/behavioral concerns than the Visual/Spatial subtype. The Processing Speed and the High Functioning/Inattentive subtypes had less severe cognitive and academic deficits,  but the High FunctioninglInattentive subtype had difficulties with attention and hyperactivity, and the Processing Speed subtype had attention difficulties and internalizing problems. This study demonstrated the fact that delineating both academic and behavioral patterns for different subtypes could help practitioners with more accurate identification practices, not only for entitlement purposes, but also for the development of individualized education programs that meet academic and psychosocial needs of children with SLD. Future research could benefit from investigation of Sill subtype patterns of functioning across cognitive, academic, and psychosocial factors.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Improving Validity of Referrals for Comprehensive Autism Evaluation : A Tier-2 Direct Autism Observation Checklist</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Heim Elberson, Mary</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Early identification of autism has received national attention and can lead to positive treatment outcomes. Research has demonstrated that qualitative impairments in social and communicative behaviors can be detected within the first two years of life. Unfortunately, many children with autism will not receive an autism diagnosis until they enter preschool. Professionals within school settings have not often received extensive training on assessment of autism spectrum disorders. Expectations, however, are that school-based teams can identify students who demonstrate characteristics associated with autism and refer those students for a comprehensive autism evaluation. Currently, autism screening tools are limited to rating scales completed by parents or teachers. Although rating scales have value in the screening process, they should not be relied upon solely to determine whether or not further assessment is warranted. Instead, rating scales should be used in conjunction with direct observation in determining if an intensive autism evaluation is necessary. Because direct observation can be subjective and reliant on the skills and experience of the observer, a tool is needed to guide and quantify observations. The current research study provided a retrospective analysis of such an observational screening tool used to observe students enrolled in a preschool program within the Christina School District. The first research question examined the relationship between scores on the observational checklist for students with typical development, developmental delays, and autism. Students with autism scored significantly lower than students with typical development and also lower than those with developmental delays. The second research question examined the effectiveness of individual checklist items at differentiating between the identified groups. Although all items effectively discriminated autism from typical and developmentally delayed peers, removing the two least effective items increased the overall sensitivity, positive predictive validity and negative predictive validity of the checklist. The third research question investigated the relationship between developmental level and overall checklist score. Developmental level, characterized as “high” (cognitive score of 85 or greater) or “low” (cognitive score of 84 or lower) did not correlate with performance on the checklist. Regardless of developmental level, the checklist correctly identified children within the autism group, based on a cut-score lower than 10 (on the 12-item checklist).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Qualitative Analysis of the Implementation of an Autism Program Within a Public School District</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hernandez, Lucila F.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The study analyzed the development, implementation and success of an educational program for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis within a public school structure. Records reviewed for a two year time period identified four phases to program development and implementation, as well as identifying themes and barriers for specific roles, administration, staff and parents. The success of the program is evidenced by growth in the children and by reported satisfaction of parents and staff. A program blue print offers an outline to program development and implementation. Necessary ASD program components, based on literature reviewed are summarized. This study highlights the feasibility and benefits of implementing a program of this type within a public school structure.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessing Patterns of Social Engagement in Typically Developing Children, Children with Mental Retardation, and Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Using a Standardized Playground Observation Checklist</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ingram, Daniel H.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Prior research in the area of play in children suggests that children&#39;s interactions with one another can predict their social competence, their social skill development, and their ability to establish and maintain social relationships. However, most prior research has been carried out in contrived playgroups under adult direction or supervision; few studies have been carried out in naturalistic settings without adult interference. This retrospective, predictive study reviewed archival data to assess similarities and differences in playground interactions between typical children, children with mental retardation, and children with autism spectrum disorder. The study introduced a structured playground observation checklist in order to standardize playground behavior observations. Three groups of children identified as: typical (N=37), children with mental retardation (N=24), and children with autism spectrum disorder (N=20) were studied to determine similarities and differences in social competence and to assess the utility of the playground behavior checklist as part of a comprehensive assessment of autism spectrum disorder. As predicted, the use of a structured playground observation checklist accurately identified differences between and among the three groups studied.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Relationship Between Prenatal Alcohol Exposure and Special Education Eligibility for Children in New Jersey: Early Intervention is Key</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jones, Jacquē L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Depending   upon the amount of alcohol consumed by the mother during pregnancy and when   the consumption occurred during fetal development, a child may develop fetal   alcohol syndrome (FAS), alcohol-related birth defects, or alcohol-related   neurodevelopmental disorder, all of which are under the umbrella category of   fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children in whom a presumptive   diagnosis has been made, such as FAS, are automatically eligible to receive   early intervention services, regardless of whether the child demonstrates   developmental delays. The purpose of the current study is to provide support   for the notion that the Early Intervention System should broaden its FAS   automatic eligibility category to include all children with prenatal alcohol   exposure, not just those with FAS.</dc:description>
