			<dc:title>Onset of Synchronization in the Disordered Hamiltonian Mean-Field Model</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Meiss, James</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Restrepo, Juan G</dc:creator>
<dc:description>We study the Hamiltonian mean field (HMF) model of coupled Hamiltonian rotors with a heterogeneous distribution of moments of inertia and coupling strengths. We show that when the parameters of the rotors are heterogeneous, finite-size fluctuations can greatly modify the coupling strength at which the incoherent state loses stability by inducing correlations between the momenta and parameters of the rotors. When the distribution of initial frequencies of the oscillators is sufficiently narrow, an analytical expression for the modification in critical coupling strength is obtained that confirms numerical simulations. We find that heterogeneity in the moments of inertia tends to stabilize the incoherent state, while heterogeneity in the coupling strengths tends to destabilize the incoherent state. Numerical simulations show that these effects disappear for a wide, bimodal frequency distribution.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Institutional and Personal Homophobia in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Post-Materialist Explanation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ormsby, Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sub-Saharan Africa is currently the most homophobic place in the world in terms of both state institutions and public opinions. Many scholars have blamed this on the former colonial powers of Africa who imposed homophobic policies on their landholdings. In order to explain variations in African homophobia, this study conceptualizes homophobia in two forms: institutional, using a measure of the homophobic actions of African states, and personal, using a composite score of multiple opinion surveys regarding homosexuality. Using linear regression models, this paper contends that Inglehhart’s post-materialist framework does a much better job of explaining variation in homophobia within Sub-Saharan Africa than could be explained by colonial influence alone. While colonial influence seems to have had a lasting impact on the homophobic culture of many Sub-Saharan states, the reinforcement of religious norms through economic underdevelopment also appears to be crucial in explaining contemporary African homophobia.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Intellectual Destroyer: Michel Foucault and The Iranian Revolution</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alshaibi, Wisam</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Interpretations of Michel Foucault’s writings on the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79 tend toward three basic stances. The critical-explanatory approach argues that an infantile leftistism set Foucault up for an uncritical approval of a backward and premodern Isalmist regime. The interpretive-neutral position refrains from value judgments preferring instead to view Foucault’s reportages as valuable insofar as they reveal lesser-known aspects of his work. Finally, Foucault’s defenders interpret the Iran writings as his movement toward humanism and liberalism, a reorientation, they argue, that ought to absolve Foucault from guilt in the case of Iran. In this paper I survey the existing positions on the reportages and ultimately deliver an alternate explanation. Grounded in the sociology of knowledge, I argue that the case of Foucault and Iran is best understood as Foucault maintaining a sense of biographical coherence in the production of knowledge. Using a theory of intellectual self-concept, I show that three identity traits: the anti-prophetic philosopher; the philosopher of the present; and infatuation with the theme of the revolution drove Foucault toward the Iranian events, and colored his interpretations of it.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cadmium Induced Transcription and NFAT/cJun Proximal Promoter Binding in Breast Cancer Cells</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Childers, Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In order to better comprehend onset and progression of diseases such as cancer, the means by which genes are regulated must be understood. RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes mRNAs that are translated into proteins, but this process is tightly controlled by transcription factors that recruit Pol II to promoter elements. These transcription factors determine if and when a gene is expressed at a basal level. This thesis focuses on the NFAT and AP-1 family of transcription activators. Each of these families has been characterized as important transcriptional activators in the onset and growth of cancer, but their mechanism of action is not well understood.
Genes up-regulated in mammary duct carcinoma in response to the environmental carcinogen cadmium chloride were identified. These genes where then used to determine the optimal cadmium concentration and time of treatment for maximal transcriptional induction. ChIP assays against NFATc2 and cJun were performed before and after treatment with cadmium. ChIP and qRT-PCR data collected suggests that genes MMP-1 and RAB11 are upregulated via cadmium chloride exposure and transcription factors NFATc2 and AP-1 are bound to promoter elements of each of these genes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploring the Extent of Neoliberal Narrative and a Faux Masculine Revival in AMC&#39;s Breaking Bad</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Heng-patton, Collin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Located within this post-recessionary period, and arguably influenced by a masculinized neoliberalism, the television show, Breaking Bad, focuses on the transformation of high school chemistry teacher, Walter White, into the drug kingpin of the southwestern United States. Yet there is more to consider than just Walt’s transformation. Because the show is situated in this era that aims to revive the masculine narrative, the show restricts non-white, non-male characters. In that sense, this project pays close attention to the relationship between Walt and Skyler in order to reveal how the show is complicit in the revival of traditional, male-centric gender roles and, most importantly, how this neoliberalized masculine narrative commodifies the nuclear family, resulting in the self-actualization of the patriarch and the oppression of the other members.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Missing Piece: Uncovering Women’s Effects on Senegambia from 1400 to 1800</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hughes, Courtney</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis explores women’s responses to change in the Senegambian region and their effects on 1400 to 1800 Senegambian economics, politics, society, and culture. Scholarship on the women of this period is largely absent. Still, studies on particular caste women during this time make it clear that women shaped European involvement in Senegambia. Through a focus on women of every caste, this study will demonstrate that women’s reactions to Europeans, climate, and conflict in Senegambia changed history. These findings improve historians’ understanding of Senegambia prior to 1800. The significance of this knowledge calls for further study to fill the gap in Senegambia’s written history.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The process the ritual: Searching For Home Within The Self</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Holzman, Jamie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The process the ritual is a twelve-minute work of movement art that seeks to undo the notions of separation between mind, body and identity in the self. This paper aims to explain the theoretical research from Buddhism, Alexander Technique and Deborah Hay’s Practicing Performance that were used to create The process the ritual. In addition, this paper can be used as a guide to understanding the creative process used to make this work as well as aid in answering the following questions: How can a sensation of peace between mind, body and identity be accessed through movement? What does it look like to be at peace in the body?</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Investigation Concerning Ancient Roman Education: The Dispelling of Widespread Illiteracy and the Significance of the Classical Model of Education Grounded in the Lives of Scholars and Emperors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dhesi, Jasvinder</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In our analyses of the Ancient World, we tend to attribute literacy in extremes; either someone studied under the tutelage of intellectuals, learned about poetry and debated philosophers or were wholly separate from any educational environment. The intent of thesis is to demonstrate that ordinary citizens had exposure to written language (Greek or Latin) in varying degrees. In addition to their ability to read and comprehend written text, there were different opportunities for lower class citizens to receive an education that mirrored (at least in part) the education of the upper class and elite. Students learned more than just a pragmatic use of the language; they had acumen of Virgil, Homer, and other prolific poets because their moral education was rooted in the pious heroes that espoused these virtues. The first part of this inquiry aims to disprove the idea that there was a very limited number of educated elite in the Roman Empire and illiterate masses still functioned cohesively in society; Essentially, arguing against the likening of Rome to Europe in the Dark Ages. Yet, based on the evidence of widespread written text and writing materials, teachers far all levels, and professions requiring a working knowledge of the language, we cannot assert such a rate of illiteracy. The first chapter closes with and look at the relationship between the oral appreciation and the pragmatic understanding of the written language as well as why contemporary students might prefer the Classical Model of education. The final part identifies the significance of education in the lives of the scholars and emperors; whether they were born in the Italian state or a province of the empire, the quality and depth of one’s education raised himself far above his competitors; securing authority rested on exemplary ability in rhetoric and philosophy. Subsequent emperors deemed education so crucial that imperial decrees banished deviant religions from academic institutions fearing their beliefs might overtake their own. In conclusion, this thesis argues that literacy was much higher in Ancient Rome and discusses the vast influence education had on the realisation of an individual’s intellectual pursuits and political consequences for the Empire.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>African Immigrant Women Within the United States Educational System: A Sociocultural/ Experiential Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Diallo, Bintou</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With debates on immigration occurring around the world, debates in the United States regarding race and racism surrounding police brutality, and discussions on the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, it has become even more pertinent to understand each others backgrounds, surroundings and identities. This paper uses the sociocultural identities of African immigrant women in the United States (US) to try to understand immigration, race, racism, gender, sexism, nationality, and ethnicity in relation to transnational leadership and feminism; all of which can be examined through the identities and experiences of African women in the US.This experiential analysis uses theories on identity development among immigrant students, on transnational feminism, and servant leadership to understand a population that is under studied and a population whose identities, due to the racialized history of the United States, are broadly categorized as Black and/or African American. While race is an important social construct that shapes opportunity and life chances in the U.S, these categories tell us little about the varied ethnic identities within racial groups, which often go unrecognized and misrecognized in research surrounding the role of culture and identity in educational institutions. To critically examine these varied ethnic identities, seven African immigrant women, whom pseudonyms are used for, narrated their experiences in the US educational system. With their intersectional self-defined identities, they described ambitions to work abroad with their immigrant group or countries of origin, and discussed struggles in terms of their nationality, race, ethnicity and gender within the US context. Based on common themes that emerged across their narrations, findings indicate that the narrators perceived their intersecting identities and experiences as different from their African American peers in important ways.These differences include having transnational perspectives and understandings of the systems of oppression that exist within and outside US society. Consequently, from their experiences of being outsiders within, African immigrant women are able to self-define, develop transnational perspectives, and have agency.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Gentrification In The Neoliberal World Order: A Study of Urban Change in the River North District of Denver, Colorado</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Conway, Laura</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The River North Arts district in Denver, Colorado has undergone a rapid transformation in the previous two years. I claim that the transformations are not the normal development of a thriving city but instead a neoliberal reimagining of the cityscape. The literature of gentrification was studied in this thesis to synthesize an understanding of gentrification as a neoliberal urban strategy. Subsequently I connected the locality of River North to the larger processes of neoliberal place making through an aesthetic reading, study of maps, and quantitative study of tax assessment data.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cinema And The Unconscious: Filmic Representations of Dreams</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stowell, Branson</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“Dreams are the touchstones of our characters.” - Henry David Thoreau, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers
The ubiquitous nature of dreams works to connect all humankind through its powerful presence in both our waking and sleeping life. I became curious about the unconscious after I recorded a series of dreams that I experienced last summer. After looking at this phenomena from the outside, I became invested in the narrative aspect of dreams and the personal nature the dreamer has with each dream. It then occurred to me how significant dreams are in our daily life. We experience thousands of dreams throughout our lifetime - varying constructions of our unconscious reassembled night after night. One of the remarkable things about dreams is that only the individual gets to experience them directly. There have been many cultural attempts to capture the dream experience. From the paintings of Salvador Dali to the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe, dreams have been a popular catalyst for artistic creation. When film came into existence, it too tried to capture that special, esoteric quality which was seemingly exclusive to the world of the dream. I noticed the special relationship between film and the unconscious and wanted to probe further into these cinematic interpretations of dreams. With the recommendation of a book, The Paradox of Sleep: The Story of Dreaming by Michel Jouvet, I began to study the mechanics behind dreams. This led me to consider the way that dreams have been adapted into cinema and also led me to notice the similarities between the cinematic representations of dreams and the scientific mechanics laid out in Jouvet’s book. I then began crafting my thesis based around two distinct dream films: Inception and Mulholland Dr. Using the book as a basis to study the films, I crafted my thesis poised to “...examine the intertwining nature of dream analysis and cinematic representations of dreams.” This paper provided illuminating evidence to the ways that films about dreams have crafted dreams and used the concept of dreaming to further add to the context of the film.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Characterization of Elmire</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Spector, Stephanie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This essay summarizes the process and creation of the role of Elmire in CU Boulder’s production of Moliere’s Tartuffe.  It discusses the roles of women in seventeenth century France and how these roles affect an actor’s interpretation of Elmire.  I argue that Elmire is an example of early feminism in theatre and that her character was purposefully placed in this play to demonstrate the importance and intelligence of women.  The paper chronicles the process for an actor from beginning to end of a production, including aspects of character work, research, and execution that create the final product.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Investigation of the Self-Invoking Trigger Hypothesis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jauregui, Armando</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study seeks to investigate the self-invoking trigger hypothesis. One aspect of the self-invoking trigger hypothesis states that when individuals activate their self-schema, also known as self-activation, their ability to learn and perform a motor skill will be hindered (Wulf &#38; Lewthwaite, 2010). A self-schema entails a set of beliefs and ideas that people have about themselves and these can affect how an individual acts in various settings (Bargh, 1982; Leite &#38; Kuiper, 2010; Markus, 1977; Stein, 1995). The self-schema may be activated through various types of self-reflection (McKay, Wulf, Lewthwaite, &#38; Nordin, 2015). Experiment 1 involved a pretest of 10 blocks composed of 3 dart throws each, a writing task during the 5 minute intertest interval, and a posttest similar in structure to the pretest (N=42). During the intertest interval the participant was asked to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses as an athlete (n=14), or reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of another athlete (n=14), while the control group performed an alphabet listing task (n=14). Experiment 2 sought to separate the effects of the direction (positive and negative) and relevance (relevant or irrelevant to the task) of self-reflection (N=48). Experiment 2 involved the same methodology as the Experiment 1, but the writing task was replaced by reflecting on either strengths in dart-throwing (n=12), weaknesses in dart-throwing (n=12), strengths in other sports (n=12), or weaknesses in other sports (n=12). Based on analyses of variance and analyses of covariance, the present study fails to reject the null hypothesis, lending support for the notion that self-reflection and self-activation have no statistically significant effect on one’s ability to learn and perform a motor skill.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Interpretive Cultural Diffusion and Natural/Cultural Esotericism: Ecotourism and It’s Implications for Sustainable Resource Management, Small-Scale Fishery Development, and the Existential Crisis of the Modern Individual</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kaiser, Samuel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper considers ecotourism as a potential alternative livelihood solution in case studies of small-scale fisheries (SSF) in coastal Tanzania. The case studies are in four locations in the Zanzibar and Mafia archipelagoes where there is a marine protected area (MPA) and where some level of ecotourism is present. SSF literature seeks to promote sustainable use of artisanal fishing grounds through decentralization and co-management techniques. Alternative livelihoods are a measure for relieving economic pressure on the fishery resources. Ecotourism is a unique alternative livelihood seeking to use tourism to generate conservation of local natural and cultural resources. By assessing the obstacles encountered in the management and development of these MPA/ecotourism case studies, one can glean information on how to encourage responsible development and on the nature of development itself. Stakeholders are found to be more engaged and cooperative when development projects are understood through their own cultural worldview. Disruptions to this framework can cause misunderstandings of goals and disengagement from the development. Using arguments founded in deep ecology’s interpretative theory, this thesis proposes the theory: Interpretive Cultural Diffusion. This theory frames the difficulties faced when different cultural frameworks collide in deep ecological terms, and explains that the diffusion of information across cultural gaps must be calculated and minimal. This paper shows that sharing cultural values is not only a key step in the co-management development process, but is the central product of ecotourism. Thus ecotourism promotes Interpretive Cultural Diffusion by requiring marginalized local communities to create an institutionalized narrative for their own culture. The value of this narrative, specifically in regards to the perception of a traditional culture’s relationship with nature, is explained in terms of deep ecology. Nature and cultural esotericism are proposed as two understandings of the value of authenticity in ecotourism.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Behavioral Syndromes in Individual Honeybees</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Weller, Amelia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Behavior can be defined as a response to a stimulus due to an individual’s unique genotype and environment.  As behaviors are expressed across contexts and over time it becomes personality.  While personality has been studied extensively in vertebrates, it is only beginning to be investigated in insects. Considering the ecological importance of honeybees (Apis mellifera), it is important to learn whether or not, and how behavior influences their personality.  In light of current concern regarding the welfare of honeybees, studies regarding their behavior may provide vital information about their responses to environmental stressors.  In my study, I used a series of assays to quantify behavioral patterns.  A shy-bold continuum of personality is recognized in many animals.  I measured behaviors along this continuum in honeybees to determine if there are behavioral differences among individuals within a colony.  I found correlations that suggest that individual bees may display behavioral differences.  I was able to investigate differences among bees, but not behavioral trajectories over time.  This study provides an initial look into how behavioral syndromes differ between individual honeybees within the same colony.  Potential future research that follows bees from their first day as adults and throughout their lives will be necessary to augment the data collected here and provide information that may lead to the idea of personality in honeybees.  As we continue to learn more about behavior and personality in honeybees it may become possible to provide ecosystem services that increase the fitness of the colony.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Killing for a Living: Psychological and Physiological Effects of Alienation of Food Production on Slaughterhouse Workers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dorovskikh, Anna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis research focuses on the negative effects that Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (later referred to as CAFOs) have on the environment and the psychological and physiological effects of alienation of food production on slaughterhouse workers of industrial slaughterhouses in comparison to niche-market slaughterhouses. Billions of animals in United States are slaughtered each year for food. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations function as establishments that raise large numbers of animals in small, confined spaces to accommodate the large demand for animal products. This comes at a certain environmental cost concerning water and air pollution. Animal agriculture produces more greenhouse gases than all of the transportation sector combined and poor regulations of CAFO establishments allows for poor waste management, which carries a big risk of contamination and spread of bacteria, viruses, pathogens, and other pollutants. Such large numbers of animals raised require a high speed of the disassembly line in industrial slaughterhouses to keep up with the animal output of CAFOs. A high speed of the disassembly line directly correlates with the injury risk rate earning slaughterhouse establishments the title of one of the most dangerous work places. Slaughterhouse workers are also at risk of Perpetration-Inducted Traumatic Stress, which is a form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and results from situations where the concerning subject suffering from PTSD was a causal participant in creating the traumatic situation. Karl Marx described alienation under Capitalist conditions as “Estranged Labour” distinguishing between four different aspects: alienation from the product of one’s labor, alienation from the labor process or one’s activity of laboring, alienation from one’s “species being,” and alienation from other human beings as a result of one’s work life demand. According to the primary research of this thesis there seems to be more alienation amongst industrial scale slaughterhouses than niche-market slaughterhouses. However, the sample size of primary research is not large enough to be representative of other niche-market slaughterhouses. The niche-market slaughterhouse investigated operates at a slower speed and employs a different managerial practice, which excludes the alienation of workers from each other. This is recommended to industrial scale slaughterhouses to reduce injury rates and increase worker satisfaction. A long-term, practical recommendation is to decrease the production of animal products as the current rate is unsustainable and negatively affects the environment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Music Participation on Academic Achievement</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Intolubbe-chmil, Daniel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Music and arts programs have diminished in importance since the passage of No Child Left Behind, upon which accountability standards have focused on progress in STEM subjects as the sole metrics of success (Beveridge 2010). Research on the importance of music and arts suggests standards need to be reset and success redefined. This study looks at how music participation affects academic achievement for individuals participating in high school band. The hypothesis being tested expects for music to facilitate higher achievement; the null predicting music has no effect on achievement. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health or Add Health, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Fixed Effects Models (FEM) reveal contrasting results when analyzing academic achievement, GPA. Past research reflects the contrasting results in this study, where researchers may manipulate methodology in order to get desired results. This research topic, as raised in prior researched, is subject to concerns of endogeneity and selection bias. To address these concerns, I compare simple OLS Models and FEM, the latter of which controls for unobserved heterogeneity or omitted bias from time invariant influences. Research from Miksza (2010) and Elpus (2013) employ OLS and FEM, respectively, in which the disparate results reflect inadequate analytic techniques using panel data. The preferable model for this longitudinal data is the FEM, which shows no significant results for music participation. The nature of the Add Health data is limited for education research so the sample I draw from consists of n=11,172 observations across three cohorts, with n=356 music participants. These cohorts describe the overlapping of two waves of data collection within four years of high school transcript data, drawn from a study called the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement transcript study (AHAA) conducted during the third wave of Add Health. After implementing both models, the coefficient estimates for marching band participation are significant in the OLS model but not in the FEM. Using a unique data set to this research topic, the results confirm past research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The City Mysteries: Crime, Vice, and Sin Revealed Through Space</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Senger, Joel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis is a spatial examination of the metropolis within three novels of the city mysteries genre. These works depict the rapidly expanding cities of Europe and America in the early 19th century and are noted for revealing the high levels of crime, vice, and sin throughout society. The architectural and inhabited space of these cities was used by the writers to inform their characters and ideas and through these same means an analysis will be made of their fictional urban environments. An exploration will be made, through the moral space of a Victorian home to determine how the authors envisioned the feasibility of a normative self-regulating subject living in these aberrant urban settings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Influence of Personality and Context on Risky Sexual Behavior among Young Adults</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kagen, Aran</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study sought to examine the relationship been alcohol and risky sexual behavior by analyzing related variables. Particularly, this study examined the relationship between context and risky sexual behavior (when participants were drinking alcohol) on an event-based level. Secondly, this study examined how certain personality traits affect risky sexual behavior in general. Finally, an interaction between context and personality was tested for its effects on risky sexual behavior. Results suggested that context plays a role in risky sexual behavior, but that personality was not an important factor. Interaction effects were not found between these variables. Future research on risky sexual behavior could benefit from including the context of sexual encounters in the research design.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development of Photodegradable Hydrogel Platforms for Cardiomyocyte Culture</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Panepento, Amanda</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It’s been shown that the microenvironments to which cells are exposed influence their shape and gene expression. Traditionally, because of the difficulty of studying cells in the body, cells are removed from the organism and are cultured on glass or plastic surfaces such as tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). One limitation of studying cells on TCPS is its non-physiologic stiffness.  In fact, TCPS is 106-fold stiffer than a healthy heart. In the interest of studying cardiac disease in a more physiologic context, we used a photodegradable hydrogel cell culture platform that can be manipulated with light to more closely represent the environments that neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) are exposed to in vivo.  Frequently, as cardiac disease progresses, the cardiac muscle becomes stiffer and the cells become less organized. Our research used UV light to create patterns in these hydrogels in order to better mimic diseased and healthy states of a heart and thus encourage cells to maintain their native phenotypes.  The hydrogels that were created influenced both the degree of cell alignment and expression levels of genes known to be sensors of health and disease (MHY6, MYH7, ANF, COL1A1, ACTA1, CCN2, ATP2A2, CACNA1C, and MMP2).  Over all, alignment indices and expression levels of many of the genes offer strong evidence in support of the claim that a PEG hydrogel system is a healthier environment for NRVMs than TCPS is.  In the future, these gels may be used as a more physiological alternative for culturing NRVMs for cardiac disease research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Conceptions of “Wilderness”: Comparing Socio-Cultural Constructions of Wilderness in Southern Bahia, Brazil and Northern Colorado</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Collins, Natasha</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis investigates and compares conceptions or visions of “wilderness.” To illustrate the differences, four different socio-cultural groups in Southern Bahia, Brazil in contrast to Northern Colorado were studied.  A total of 80 people were surveyed and interviewed, 40 in Brazil and 40 in Colorado with 10 people from each socio-cultural group: university professors, university students, environmentalists, and family farmers.  The objective of this research was to achieve a greater understanding of their perspectives on the human-nature relationship and the implications of these perceptions for environmental understanding and action.  Through the compilation and analysis of the data, it is concluded that Northern (United States) and Southern (Brazil) Environmentalist distinctions begin to dissolve while similarities emerge between parallel socio-cultural groups.  Brazilian farmers and a few United States professors and environmentalists were against preservation areas where no humans are allowed.  These individuals did not separate humans from nature and also believed in the rights of native people to continue to live on their land. Some people separated humans and nature placing nature as more important because they often have positive definitions of “wilderness” contrasted to negative ones of “civilization.”  Certain individuals placed humans above nature, especially the U.S. farmers and a few students in Brazil and the U.S.  Many individuals believed that humans and nature are the same thing.  Most people agreed that education and cultural changes were needed to improve the human-nature relationship and these improvements should be made.  The intention is that discoveries in this topic can be used to improve environmental management methods in both countries, specifically related to national parks in Brazil.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Asian Refugees: The Case of China, Vietnam, North Korea, and the International Community</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dong, Leslie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The world is plagued by the largest refugee crisis since World War II. At this given time, there are more than 51 million displaced people around the world and nearly 35% of them originate from and remain in Asia. Due to the absence of developed regional institutions, refugee crises remain largely a state-to-state issue in Asia, making China (P.R.C.) a key player in addressing these crises. China&#39;s geographic location and its robust economic growth has not only made it an ideal haven for refugees, China&#39;s growing influence in Asia has also given it an unprecedented opportunity to establish itself as a leader in humanitarian crises. Because of the immense impact that China&#39;s refugee policies have on the surrounding region, this study seeks to examine how China formulates its refugee policies and why it adopts certain policies over others in different situations. By examining the driving factors for China&#39;s starkly different response to the Vietnamese refugee crisis (1978-1979) and the North Korean refugee crisis (since the 1990s), this study sheds light on China&#39;s policy considerations and its implications for the rest of Asia.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Asperger’s Syndrome in General Elementary Education: Problems, Resources, and Improvement for All</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Anderson, Kristin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>General education placement is believed to be the best option for educating students with Asperger’s syndrome (AS)—or High Functioning Autism—but has been debated within the fields of education and psychology.  This thesis starts with a brief history of AS and common comorbidities, then addresses the mandates and policies that govern special education, which leads to the main research about successful practices for students with AS both within a general education classroom and those from specialty schools.  This thesis examines the practices created for students with AS and determine whether those practices can be extrapolated to education in general.  Through an extensive literature review of both psychological studies and educational theories and practices, I determined that strategies designed for students with AS can and should be applied to all mainstream classrooms.  Students with AS have a lot to offer to educators and by capitalizing on their strengths and common strategies to help them, all education can be improved.  This research shows us that social skills training, and well-designed classrooms can be helpful for all students, regardless of whether they have a learning disability.  Implications for future teacher education and best practices to include in all classrooms are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Beliefs, Intentions, Actions, &#38; Reflections (BIAR): A New Way to Look at the Interactions of Students and Teachers</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Euler, Elias</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An accurate, nuanced capturing and characterization of student/teacher behavior inside and outside the classroom is a necessity in today’s education reform. In this paper, a new framework, called the BIAR (Beliefs, Intentions, Actions, and Reflections) Student-Teacher Interaction Model, is introduced. This tool incorporates the use of TDOP (Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol) in classroom observations alongside student/faculty interviews, stimulated recall sessions, and electronic surveys. Once gathered, the data can be compared and rated for their degree of correlation. While the work in this project wasn’t aimed at making any specific claims about the practices of teachers or students, the introduction of the BIAR Model provides a structure for future work in this area.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Reclaiming Economics: An Examination of Environmental Justice  Nonprofits’ Rhetoric and Strategies for a New Economy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Holtz, Nina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This project explores how grassroots environmental justice (EJ) nonprofits discursively construct solutions for economic justice under neoliberal capitalism. Specifically, this paper aims to examine if certain EJ organizations use neoliberal or Solidarity Economy (SE) rhetoric and mechanisms for change in their economic campaigns. In the Environmental Justice Movement (EJM), divergent opinions exist about the use of neoliberal rhetoric and reformist strategies in environmental justice (EJ) activism. While some EJ scholars express the movement should advance justice through working to deconstruct capitalism, others assert the radical “high road” is politically infeasible and that groups must collaborate with existing economic and political systems. This study conducts a discourse analysis to assess the text of 40 grassroots EJ organizations’ websites for rhetoric and strategies advocating neoliberal or SE ideology and reformist or radical political approaches to change. Further, this analysis illustrates that the three case study coalitions and their affiliated nonprofits are generally pursuing a Solidarity Economy framework and using both reformist and radical rhetoric and mechanisms for change in their campaigns for economic and environmental justice.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exercise Induces Age-Dependent Neuroplastic Changes in Brain Regions Responsible for Learning Memory and Emotional Behavior</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hulen, Kristina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>During early-life, the brain experiences a variety of developmental adaptions and undergoes a period of immense neural pruning, making the brain more plastic and susceptible to change from external events. Exercise is one such event that produces a milieu of adaptive changes including improved brain plasticity and function, increases in hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and BDNF-mediated enhancements in hippocampal function. Recent work has shown that exercise during early life has can produce long-lasting improvements in brain function that would normally be transient in adulthood. The specific developmental period during which the hippocampus is prone to exercise-induced neuroplastic changes, however, is unknown because previous studies testing the impacts of early life exercise had rats run across multiple developmental stages. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact that exercise has on BDNF if initiated during two different and clearly defined early life developmental periods, the early juvenile period immediately post weaning versus the pubescent period surrounding puberty onset.  Hippocampal BDNF mRNA levels were measured following one week of exercise and after 14 days following exercise cessation in juvenile (approx. postnatal day 24), pubescent (approx. postnatal day 40), and in adult rats (approx. postnatal day 7). Exercise produced significant increases in BDNF mRNA compared to sedentary matched counterparts across all ages in the dentate gyrus immediately following one week of exercise. Juvenile rats exhibited a trend towards long-lasting increases in BDNF 14 days after exercise within the dentate gyrus and the CA3. Thus, exercise produced trends toward enduring increases in BDNF when initiated before puberty. These data suggest that the juvenile brain may have the greatest propensity for long term increases in BDNF following exercise.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Changing Perceptions: How We See the Salton Sea, and Why it Matters</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Vergo, Tarah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Salton Sea is a large, man-made body of water in Southern California. It was formed completely by accident between 1905 and 1907 by a combination of poor irrigation engineering and massive winter flooding of the Colorado River. Though the sea had formed and disappeared several times before this, and was part of the local Cahuilla Indian oral tradition, initially its presence was believed to be temporary. Beginning in the early 1940s, as it became apparent that the sea was not going to disappear, real estate developers and agricultural industry began to exploit the sea and its surrounding land for economic gain. Beginning in the late 1960s, the booming tourism and resort communities that formed around the sea began to crumble, due to continued poor management and several environmental disasters that resulted in the shrinking of the sea and massive die-offs of fish and birds. Today, news media see the Salton Sea as an abandoned wasteland, while scientists and ecologists consider it a vital ecological landscape. The surrounding communities of Salton City and Bombay Beach are still inhabited, although the populations are small and the quality of housing is poor. Though there continue to be occasional die-offs, the sea still functions as a stopover for migratory birds. The Salton Sea was formed as the result of human error, greed, and ecological misunderstanding. Continuing intervention, rather than fixing or solving anything, has only exacerbated the environmental and human problems surrounding the sea. This thesis will show how misperceptions of the sea led to ineffective interventions and exploitation of resources, both of which resulted in the current devastation facing the sea today.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An applied project in Environmental Communication: Exploring whether people’s eating habits can be influenced to incorporate local food through the production of a short documentary film</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shlom, Alison</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In order to explore how average people might be influenced to demonstrate environmentally-friendly behaviors, I researched how eco-social documentaries influence an individual’s behaviors.  I produced my own film about local food to compare to this research, and then conducted a survey to see whether there is potential for my film to influence the intent of participants to change their food-buying behaviors.  I found that the level of influence varies depending on the background of the participant, with a general trend of feeling motivated and educated after viewing the film.  Results showed significant change of intent to make a purchase at a farmer’s market in the following month and to pay a slightly higher price for local food in the following month. My findings show that there is potential for documentary films to influence people’s individual behaviors.  This means that there is potential for film to reach broad audiences and create eco-social change.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Gandhian Ashram and its Contemporaries</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bower, Charles</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper explores the Gandhian Ashram as a reaction to the forces of modernity in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Its deviation from the existing historiography is primarily in its exploration of the Ashram as one of many incidents of communal experiments at the time, which have an interesting geographic connection in London. I note Gandhi’s readings of John Ruskin and Leo Tolstoy, his interactions with dietetic and communal experiments in London, and some of the local precedents for the Ashram in arguing that these communal living experiments can be seen as a reaction to the forces of modern nation-building, especially as an anticolonial reaction.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Establishing a Baseline in Water Quality for the North Fork Valley: Implications of Future Oil and Gas Drilling</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lewand, Jessica</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In response to the increased use of hydraulic fracturing in the US the extraction of natural gas has drastically expanded in the last decade. This has sparked controversy surrounding the potential environmental impacts of this industry on groundwater and surface water quality. This honors thesis explores the potential sources for water contamination through a review of the existing literature. The findings suggest that water may become contaminated from stray gas migration, surface spills, wastewater treatment, and improperly sealed well casings. The fundamental problem surrounding this controversial issue is the lack of baseline water quality data. The second aspect of this thesis is to establish a water quality baseline for the North Fork Valley in Delta County, Colorado where there is proposed oil and gas drilling. My hypothesis is that the aquifers are not interacting with oil and gas bearing formations. I collected samples in September of 2014 following the protocol outlined by the Colorado Water and Energy Research Center (CWERC), and tested for 26 different analytes. These results were then compared to historical data collected in the area by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), the Western Slope Conservation Center (WSCC), and a previous test done by one well owner. The baseline represents a summary of forty groundwater samples, eleven springs, and twenty-nine surface water samples.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Roasting Sustainability: Sustainability Assessment for Coffee Lab International and Vermont Artisan Coffee and Tea Co</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Toland, Owen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis is a sustainability assessment in which energy and resource consumption are analyzed for two sister businesses, Coffee Lab International and Vermont Artisan Coffee and Tea Co., located in Waterbury, Vermont owned by Mané Alves. The paper begins by providing background information of the coffee industry and investigating a newly emerging market, sustainable coffee. Categories analyzed at the businesses include electricity consumption, propane consumption, water consumption, transportation, waste, and their associated carbon dioxide emissions. A combination of energy bills, business records, and personal observations were used to examine the previously mentioned categories. The purpose of this thesis is to serve as a baseline reference for Mr. Alves to compare the effectiveness of future sustainable initiatives. Mr. Alves is proposing to construct a new building to house his coffee businesses. At the end of the paper, several recommendations are provided for areas in which the sustainability of both businesses can be improved.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Food in the City: Community-Driven Agriculture across the United States</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Watt, James</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Urban Agriculture is an accepted practice in many cities and countries, and has attracted a broad cross-section of people across the United States to start growing food in their communities. In some cases, the motivation behind Urban Agriculture is clear, but throughout the history of Urban Agriculture in the United States there have been many reasons why urbanites have started growing food. Such reasons include an ideological battle against conventional agriculture, the need for food itself, the desire to recreate, and the urge to educate others. The motivation behind the practice varies from location to location with national trends shifting throughout history as communities struggled to understand what Urban Agriculture meant to them. Ultimately, however, the motivations of the Americans on the ground practicing Urban Agriculture are largely undocumented. Through a series of interviews with practitioners of Urban Agriculture across the United States, I have gathered data suggesting that the primary reasons why Americans are growing food in cities today are to have a career in a profession they enjoy and to educate others about the benefits they see in Urban Agriculture.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Students’ Knowledge and Opinions Concerning Genetically Modified Organisms: A Survey at University of Colorado Boulder</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Folkerth, Connor</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper discusses the controversial topic of Genetically Modified Organisms, their relationship with food crops, and how opinions on their use are formed. University students are taught to think critically about each subject presented to them and view multiple aspects of the issue. It could be assumed that students studying in an environmental field, such as Environmental Studies, may have more knowledge and stronger opinions about the topic. A survey was sent to roughly 10,000 CU-Boulder students in order to figure out where they get their information on GMOs, what risks and benefits they know about GMOs, and what their overall opinion is about them. The results showed a much more neutral response to how GMOs are being used and revealed that students are using more objective and scientific sources for their information gathering. The respondents also recognized both the concerns and benefits that result from GMOs for food crops. Having more information about the topic did not necessarily show a stronger opinion regarding the topic. One recommendation for future studies would be to survey public opinions on GMOs, then provide them with information they do not already know about GMOs, and see if it changes their opinion.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Forgiving the Self and Others: Exploring Component Level Differences and the Effects of  Personality</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hampton, Lucas</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Forgiveness has been predicted by and correlated with aspects of personality, although few have analyzed these relationships by a forgiveness of self and others distinction, or by components of forgiveness (benevolence, avoidance, revenge). This study tested 91 university students using the Big Five Personality Inventory, and assessed forgiveness through scenario based measures. The study addressed three questions in specific: (a) are there differences between forgiveness of self and forgiveness of others; (b) does personality predict forgiveness; and (c) are there any moderating variables (explanatory style or working memory capacity) in the relationships found. I found that differences existed within types of forgiveness (self and other); that neuroticism is the most significant personality predictor of forgiveness; and that explanatory style moderates the forgiveness by condition (self versus other) relationship. These results suggest that people on average are more willing to forgive themselves than others, that across types of forgiveness (self and other), individuals scoring higher in neuroticism are less likely to forgive in general, and that the effect of condition on forgiveness becomes less prominent in individuals with higher explanatory style scores.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Youth Empowerment in Sex Education</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Raitz, Katherine L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Sex education in public high schools is a critical topic in women and gender studies because sex education content impacts young people’s experiences with and understandings of sex, gender, relationships, and behaviors that impact health and quality of life. This paper critiques the sex education policy and practice in Colorado in order to increase opportunities for youth empowerment. The methods utilized in this paper are critical historical analysis of sex education policy development in the United States, critical discourse analysis of a sex education curriculum that is recommended by the Colorado policy, case studies of sex education extracurricular leadership programs, and interviews with high school-aged leaders in the extracurricular programs. Evidence is presented that the sex education policy in Colorado focuses too strongly on narrow outcomes, including increasing condom use, delaying sexual debut, and reducing a student’s number of sexual partners. The conclusion suggests that increasing the critical thinking opportunities in sex education design will support student learning and agency within sexual experiences and relationships. The paper calls on policy makers to involve sexual health community leaders and youth perspectives in future policy development.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>China’s Youth: Stories of Modern Chinese Young Adults</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Becker-uncapher, Hannah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>I arrived in Beijing on June 30th 2014 to complete the groundwork for this book, a creative nonfiction account of youth culture in modern China. A few years earlier, I had lived in China for nine months, arriving a month after my sixteenth birthday. Now back again at twenty years old, I traveled down the east coast, ventured west into Sichuan, and finally looped back to Beijing, interviewing young Chinese adults in the cities where I stopped. I recorded the interviewees’ complete life stories and went on to analyze the major elements of these stories in order to discover how they fit into China’s wider youth culture. This book incorporates my interviews and analyses, and it delves into topics such as gender equality, wealth equality, family dynamics, and environmental protection, as they relate to China&#39;s youth population.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Numerical simulation of photoionization of atoms and attosecond laser pulses</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Reiff, Ran</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With appropriate filters, high harmonic generation (HHG) can produce X-ray pulses on the attosecond time scale. We formulate a procedure to minimize pulse duration in various energy regimes and predict photoionization rates for a number of noble gases. Bridging the gap between the theory of high harmonic generation and the experimental reality, we seek to support the production of tabletop X-ray sources able to probe electron dynamics in inner shells. This thesis builds on the work of other researchers in the Ultrafast AMO Theory group, including a novel analytic fitting to noble gas potentials, and predictions of the energy spectrum and phases obtained by high harmonic generation. Specifically, computational methods (including Crank-Nicolson) and the single active electron model allow for the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and calculation of photoionization probabilities, while numerical Fourier transforms enable rapid analysis of filtered HHG spectra.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Changes in Tree Swallow Phenology Due to Climate Change in Alaska</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Irons, Rachel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Ecological effects of climate change are beginning to be seen across the globe. In avian species, these effects often manifest in earlier breeding dates. Tree swallows in the temperate zones of North America advanced their laying date by nine days between 1959 and 1991. However tree swallows in more arctic regions, where climate change is occurring more rapidly, have not yet been studied. Additionally, two important climate variables, wind and precipitation, have been largely ignored in climate change studies to date. I used tree swallow nest records from Fairbanks, Alaska to examine how climate change is affecting these birds in the northern part of their range. To provide a more comprehensive view on how tree swallows are being affected by climate change, I looked at effects from wind and precipitation in addition to temperature. I found an advance in laying date and a decrease in incubation time, resulting in a greater advance in hatch date, associated with increasing temperatures and decreasing wind speeds. I conclude that tree swallows in Alaska are hatching earlier and that this shift is likely caused by increasing temperatures and decreasing wind speeds in May and June.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>INFLUENCE OF NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT ON STRUCTURING DIATOM COMMUNITIES IN A GLACIAL MELTWATER STREAM,  MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS, ANTARCTICA</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Darling, Joshua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In the arid McMurdo Dry Valleys of East Antarctica, glacial meltwater streams flow for 6-10 weeks during the austral summer. Harbored in these meltwater streambeds are diatom communities, which are part of a microbial mat matrix. These mat assemblages endure desiccating winters and become reactivated upon rehydration during the austral summer. Water is considered the major limiting resource in the dry valley stream ecosystems, and the variable flow of meltwater has been shown to regulate the biomass and growth of these algal mats. However, other environmental variables could influence the structure of these mat communities. In this thesis, the influences of nutrients are examined as a regulatory control on diatom community structure. This thesis draws from previous experimentation using Nutrient Diffusing Substrates (NDS) with nitrate and phosphate amendments that were left in Green Creek for algae to colonize. Characterization of diatom communities that grew on NDS units showed that nitrate enrichments significantly altered diatom relative abundance, with an increase in Fistulifera pelliculosa to 21% relative abundance in nitrate treatments compared to other nutrient amendments, which had less than 5% F. pelliculosa abundance. Other nutrient amendments showed only a marginal influence on diatom relative abundance. In addition, nitrate and phosphate amendments showed greater average diatom densities relative to the control treatments, with the greatest densities occurring in nitrate amendments. These results suggest that nutrients influence diatom growth and accrual, although stream hydrology and geomorphology likely have a greater influence on regulating the structure of these diatom communities within the microbial mat matrix. Moreover, the results from this thesis can help to predict the response by diatom communities to expected landscape changes in McMurdo Dry Valley streams as a function of climate change, such as increase flow and subsequent nutrient enrichment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Virgin Atlantic Airways: A Look Inside the Airline’s Green Initiatives</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Notis, Ilana</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Greenwashing is a growing trend in the advertising of organization’s green efforts as well as the relationship it holds with a corporation’s public image and identity. Environmental communication is used to discuss our surroundings as well as controversial topics such as carbon emissions. Companies are seen to partake in greenwashing as a newer approach for them to achieve greater success. The importance of their image and identity is crucial to the portrayal of their organization to the general public. Image and identity also influence the corporation’s sense of understanding their place in their industry and society. In this study, I analyze Virgin Atlantic Airways green initiative programs as possible culprits of greenwashing through their use of rhetoric to depict themselves as a green corporation. I found that Virgin Atlantic can be deemed guilty of partaking in these actions through their largely publicized efforts that may have little to no effect on the environment, their disregard of the programs failures or small-scale efforts, and their conflicting voice in relation to their business and environmental programs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Single Crystal and Polycrystalline VO2</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Daly, Meaghan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In recent decades, interest has rapidly developed in the group of materials known as strongly correlated electron systems. These systems exhibit numerous startling behaviors ranging from high temperature superconductivity to the topic of this thesis: metal-insulator transitions, specifically in the material vanadium dioxide (VO2). Unfortunately, due to wide variations within and between samples, it has been difficult to determine the underlying cause of such a phenomenon. In an effort to establish more consistent discrepancies between different growth methods, I have studied two samples of VO2 : a single crystal and a polycrystalline thin film. The differences observed in the responses of each provide validation to further research in this area, if not a fully conclusive result.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploring the Mechanisms of Implementation Intentions: A Preschool Intervention</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Meyer, Laura Grace</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In childhood, the ability to exhibit self-control, or to adapt behavior to promote goal achievement, is an essential predictor for general life outcomes. Children with strong control abilities develop into adults who are more successful in domains such as health, wealth and academic achievement. One aspect of self-control is the ability to resist temptation in the face of attractive distractions. For this reason, interventions that target improvements in distraction avoidance in young, preschool-aged children may improve self-control. The present study tested the effectiveness of implementation intentions (IIs), or if-then plans used to facilitate goal achievement (Gollwitzer, 1999), to improve the performance on a categorization task by increasing the ability to resist distraction in school-aged and preschool-aged children. Additionally, by measuring the relationship between individual differences in categorization task performance and individual differences in proactive control, the cognitive control mechanisms supporting the effectiveness of IIs were tested. We found no evidence that IIs improved task performance in either age group; thus, the mechanisms underlying IIs remain unresolved. Future projects will be necessary for making strong conclusions about the effectiveness of II interventions in young children and the potential cognitive control mechanisms on which IIs operate.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How Do Absence Data Predict the Performance of Species Distribution Models?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pederson, Rebecca</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Species distribution maps are a fundamental data source for ecologists and evolutionary biologist that connect more broadly into policy, management, and society. These maps are not unfamiliar to the general public, often found in field guides and park brochures. Today, species distribution mapping and modeling can be done at much finer-scale resolution than previously, facilitated by new Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and techniques and the availability of species presence data and environmental data. However, most broad-scale species distribution models only utilize species presence data. Here, I explore how absence data can help improve species maps. The goal for my work is to show how species inventories can provide a means to generate probabilistic assessment of absences. In order to generate absences, I helped develop a means to assess the completeness of an “area inventory” (e.g. park or protected area surveys) by capturing metadata of published inventories. For those inventories assessed to be “mostly” complete, I compared the list of species present with a broader-scale list generated from range maps (utilizing a species list tool already available in Map of Life). If species were present in the Map of Life species list but not the inventory list, this was considered an inferred absence. Finally, I selected 25 species presumed to be absent based on my comparisons, to assess the performance of habitat models. I was able to document that these habitat models were generally making errors of commission (predicting suitable habitat where they should predict absence). Further refining these maps can further help (i) our knowledge in biodiversity, (ii) in conservation strategy for endangered species, which can lead to management and policy, and in (iii) educating the public about species and their distribution.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Is a Corpse a Corpse? Spatial Aspects of Necrophoresis in the Western Harvester Ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zelagin, David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Disease poses a threat to any society, and this threat is amplified for societies persisting in cramped quarters over extended periods of time. Highly social (eusocial) insects actively combat the danger of pathogen proliferation with a myriad of tactics, one of which is necrophoresis or the removal of corpses from the nest. This study examines the spatial patterns of the corpse depositions of several wild colonies of the western harvester ant, Pogonmyrmex occidentalis. These colonies were presented with nestmate as well as non-nestmate corpses to discern if this type of waste could be treated categorically. Specialized areas for corpse disposal, reported in the literature as “ant graveyards” were not observed, suggesting that observations of such accumulations in the species may be an artifact of laboratory conditions. Non-nestmate corpses were carried further away from the nest than were nestmate corpses, presumably reducing the chance of introduction of foreign pathogens to the colony. Factors external to the nest mound, such as slope and nearby neighbors, had no detectable effect on these depositions and failed to result in anything other than rather uniform dispersal of this particular waste. These findings shed light on the intricacies of a set of behaviors that are critical to the notable ecological success of these organisms. Research in recent years has increased our understanding of necrophoresis, but much remains to be discovered. Corpse removal is proving to be a dynamic activity in the world of eusocial insects, and investigation of this disease mitigation tactic, along with other such tactics employed by eusocial insects will aid in our understanding of topics such as immunity, division of labor, polyethism, and even the evolution of sociality itself.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Differentiated College-Prep Course Access: An Analysis of Colorado Public Schools</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wolk, Alexandra</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis makes the case that the United States has an education system that provides different access to different kinds of students. More specifically, this paper questions whether or not students have differentiated access to classes that would realistically prepare them for and help them get accepted to college. The question this thesis attempts to answer is: Are schools systematically shunting low socio-economic status students into non-college tracks compared to students with higher socio-economic statuses? Through original data collection and data obtained from a case study it is clear that there is an achievement gap between low income and high-income students. Based on the case study, it shows that low-income students are underrepresented in college prep classes. Although this study was ultimately inconclusive in attributing this gap to the access of college prep classes, the small data set and positive relationship merits a more in depth look into this correlation. This study begins the complicated process of understanding how and why different courses are offered to different students as well as how those choices can affect them when and if they apply to college.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Homegrown Terrorism and the British Experience: A Historical Analysis of the Rise of British Muslim Radicalization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Connolly, Emma Rose</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The rise in terrorist acts carried out by individuals who have been raised and radicalized within the Western countries they are attacking has increasingly become a common topic for study and conversation over the past few decades. With revelations that numerous British individuals have now joined the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the issue has heightened the interest of the British population and government. This study utilizes theories of revolution and psychological theories of radicalization in order to analyze the rise in homegrown terrorism within the British context on three levels: the societal, the global, and the individual. This examination demonstrates that while multiple variables are involved, they are interacting and contingent, showing that isolation of a single aspect cannot lead to a full understanding of how and why this situation has arisen. A historical review shows that immigration and other externally originated forces helped create dysfunction in the British social system, which, combined with the influence of globalization, has allowed the process of radicalization to take root. The study concludes that this disequilibrium is a result of misalignment of the values of the population and the socioeconomic structure of the society, which, if not corrected, will potentially allow situations such as these to develop.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigating a Century-Long Hole in History:  The Untold Story of Ayahuasca From 1755-1865</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Williams, Justin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis illuminates the lost history of ayahuasca and argues that a larger institution, the ethnocentric and economically focused European milieu, prevented eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europeans from further investigating this mysterious plant-based hallucinogenic infusion.  A myriad of factors contributed to these triumphal trade winds of prevailing European thought—ethnocentricity, consequent internalization, economic avarice, and European geo-political domination.  In addition, there were other fateful historical circumstances beyond the influence of European paradigms that may have prevented ayahuasca from entering mainstream history.
This thesis begins an understanding toward the reasons that led to a century of historical cover-up—the skeleton of what occurred is laid out, with hopes of the flesh to be filled in later.  Significantly, this story brings light to the limits of western intellectual paradigms, for although the impetus to further understand this vine of souls was in the fingertips of talented intellectuals, the prevailing European milieu impeded further intellectual investigation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Opening Agriculture: Alternative Technological Strategies for Sustainable Farming</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rankin, Daniel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis investigates the potential for alternative technology development for the purposes of improving sustainable agriculture. By synthesizing ideological frameworks from Agroecology, Appropriate Technology and Open Source Hardware, a set of benchmarks are defined in order to gauge the sustainability of existing agricultural technology, as well as guide the development of new farm technology. Using these benchmarks, a number of practical farm technology projects envisioned by the author are discussed, with an emphasis on the design and construction of two specific projects, an egg incubator and an electric fence charger, both built with salvaged materials and open-source documentation. While the cost of each project was far less expensive than its commercial equivalent, time spent and labor costs are examined and discussed in light of other future open-source farm projects.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Problematic Nature of Humanitarian Aid</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Howe, Lorien</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The industry of humanitarian aid is often ineffective at best.  A collision of factors occurs for those who try to help, often complicated by feelings of compassion or guilt, preventing efforts from being directed in the most effective ways.  Further, humanitarian organizations often are not aware of their Western biases, and the ways in which they demean those whom they would aid.  Literature and cinema are used to examine and illustrate the effects of creating people as a separate “other,” and to look at the damage, loss of power, and misunderstanding it creates.  Case studies of humanitarian organizations, using narrative analysis, demonstrate such biases and the effects that storytelling has on the treatment of human beings trapped in poverty.  The case study analysis allows the public to be more consciously aware of their own biases, and suggests more effective ways of ameliorating the issues that are at play in poverty.  Common misperceptions are broken down, and new ways of thinking are constructed.  The practical benefit is that people will be able to apply this knowledge to their own research in order to develop more holistic, humanizing, and effective approaches to the eradication of poverty.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Creating Connective Library Spaces: A librarian-student collaboration model</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Watkins, Alexander</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Kuglitsch, Rebecca</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The new academic library is a dynamic space where users and unique resources come together to produce new ideas. Libraries have struggled to be relevant spaces that attract students yet are more than simple study halls. The library as a connective space is one solution. This idea is not just about providing study space or collections space or even their juxtaposition, but about coming up with innovative ways to harness their proximity. The library wanted to develop spaces that foster both intentional and informal learning and are grounded in strong disciplinary identities for the sciences and the arts. At the University of Colorado Boulder we used service learning in a student collaboration model to generate novel approaches to library spaces. Two parallel areas of the library, the Science Commons and the Arts Commons, were reinvented to showcase the digital and analog library resources that inform their respective subjects. In this project, the library particularly hoped to harness the synergy between science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and art and design (which, when combined with STEM is known as STEAM) to develop spaces that promote an atmosphere of creativity. The Science Commons highlights the digital collections and the research and innovation they support; while the Arts Commons exposes the aesthetics of the library&#39;s print collection and the artwork it inspires. Both rely on student involvement and a commitment to the new library as a connective space that by connecting users to the library’s resources will facilitate informal learning activities: discovery, exploration, and self-directed research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Can only Librarians do Library Instruction? Collaborating with Graduate Students to Teach Discipline-Specific Information Literacy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Watkins, Alexander</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Morrison, Katherine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Subject Librarians often have difficulty delivering instruction that reaches the often large, introductory courses in their disciplines in a meaningful way. However, there is a need for basic subject specific library instruction that scaffolds advanced upper-division classes. This challenge requires rethinking the idea that only librarians can teach information literacy, and we propose creative collaboration between librarians and graduate students to integrate information literacy into introductory disciplinary classes. This paper presents one strategy for collaborating with graduate students to reach first-year students, and is the combined effort of the Art &#38; Architecture Librarian and the lead graduate art history TA at CU-Boulder. The required World Art Studies I &#38; II classes are one of the best ways to reach all CU-Boulder art undergraduates, but teaching every recitation would be too much for one art liaison librarian. By using a train the trainer model to teach the TA’s how to conduct an information literacy sessions, we were then able to reach students in small interactive classes led by graduate students. The paper will present assessment data gathered from students and describe both our successes and areas for improvement. To study the effects of the program we interviewed the TA’s, and we found that collaboration also had benefits for the graduate students. It introduced them information literacy and honed their pedagogical skills. Since often the best way to learn is to teach, they found their own research skills improved. The graduate students expressed enthusiasm for collaboration with the library, and we believe our program is the start of many library partnerships throughout the careers of these future art professionals and faculty.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Identifying OH Imposters in the ALFALFA Neutral Hydrogen Survey</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Suess, Katherine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>OH megamasers (OHMs) are rare, luminous molecular masers that are typically observed in (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ([U]LIRGs) and serve as markers of major galaxy mergers. In blind emission line surveys such as the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey for neutral hydrogen (HI) in the local universe, OHMs at z~0.2 can mimic z~0.05 HI lines. We present the results of optical spectroscopy of ambiguous HI detections in the ALFALFA 40% data release (Haynes et. al 2011) detected by WISE but with uncertain optical counterparts. The optical redshifts, obtained from observations at the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m telescope, identified 127 HI optical counterparts and discovered five new OHMs. Fifty-six candidates remain ambiguous. The new OHMs are the first detected in a blind spectral line survey.
The number of OHMs in ALFALFA matches predictions based on the OH luminosity function (Darling &#38; Giovanelli 2002). Additionally, the OHMs found in a blind survey do not seem to differ from those found in previous targeted surveys. This provides validation of the methods used in previous IR-selected OHM surveys and indicates there is no previously unknown OHM-producing population at z~0.2. We also provide a method for future surveys to separate OH and HI lines without expensive spectral observations. This method utilizes infrared colors and magnitudes, such as WISE (Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer) mid-IR data. Since the fraction of OHMs found in flux-limited HI surveys is expected to increase with the redshift of the survey (Briggs 1998), this analysis can be applied to future flux-limited high-redshift hydrogen surveys.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Religious Imperative of Confucianism</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Davies, Samuel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Confucianism prescribes for society an immensely rich, sophisticated, and utilitarian modality of social relationship. Not only has this served as China&#39;s social and political bedrock, but it has actually evolved from, and thus suggests, the deep religious dimensionality of Confucian thought. I aim to, through the medium of Confucianism,  unveil the social entity of this religious dimension as an intuitive depth and unifying reciprocity which has since the dawn of civilization been preserved and expressed as the most quintessential aspect of human life.
With an exploratory dive into the farthest metaphysics that underlie the foundational Confucian society, the true sacrality of social order becomes exposed as a model for human progress. It is the individual and collective embodiments of this sacred social modality and its innate ethical posture which carve true, lasting moral shape into our lives. The ontological controversy that will be found between contrasting expressions of this reality, especially between dualism and monism, will be discovered as an illusory barrier, entirely undermined by the Confucian dialog which effectively welds the religious to the secular, the sacred to the profane, the spiritual to the material, and the society to the individual.
From this religious quest of anthropocosmic harmony which renders society as a collectivity of sacred relativity, Confucius has presented for history the blueprints of utopia. This essay will, in framing religion as the same co-arising moiety of society, attempt to recover the shattered debris of the religious ethic, the true sincerity and seriousness of sagehood, and the innate universality of reciprocity. From this frontier, it is then possible to clearly see the profound religious imperative of Confucianism as neither a fanatical nor lethargic, overbearing nor naive religiosity, but as a simple expression of the perennial image of humanity, which is, when measured in eternity, both the secular and spiritual ideal.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Ka-Tzetnik 135633: Historical Depersonalization and the Celebrity Witness</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Allen, Hannah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>“Ka-Tzetnik 135633: Historical Depersonalization and the Celebrity Witnessm” will concern early representations of the Holocaust written by Yehiel De-Nur, who wrote under the name Ka-Tzetnik 135633, which loosely translates to Concentration Camp Inmate 135633. This author, with his first book appearing in 1946, produced the sextet Salamanda: A Chronicle of a Jewish Family in the Twentieth Century. The books concern the author’s own experience of the Holocaust via a fictionalized persona, as well as the experiences that he believes his siblings endured after they were separated in the ghettoes. My project will use these highly controversial books as a launching point to breech subjects such as sexual violence during the Holocaust, survivor’s guilt, the narration of trauma, and the reception of De-Nur’s books in Israel.
This essay addresses four central questions surrounding De-Nur’s work: the split of identity between the pre- and post-incarcerated self, localized at the site of the author’s imposed and chosen names; the way his books broke the silence among the children of survivors and how that impacted their understanding of the historical reality of the Holocaust; how his books have controversially represented the idea of Jewish complicity in the suffering of their fellows; in addition to the way his books have been politicized in modern Israel to support a burgeoning nationalist identity. This project attempts to look at these disparate angles in relation to each other, as well as place them in context with many canonical Holocaust works and critical theory to demonstrate why the books are controversial. Considering all of these angles, the project will ultimately argue for the viability of the human imagination as an instrument of mourning, accessing the past, and, preserving the individual against the genocidal efforts of the past. By studying Ka-Tzetnik (De-Nur) and the many questions his works raise, the essay demonstrates the tenuous line between testimony and fiction, and ultimately posits the hybrid forms of imaginative testimonies as another kind of historical knowledge.The exclusion of the personal, the subjective, from national emplotments of history risk that such widespread violence could occur again, in the sense that the reduction of the personal continues the way that violence has been justified by dehumanizing others. By acknowledging the individual traumas of the past, along with their philosophic implications, the human race acknowledges a global, nationless responsibility that everyone holds to ensure that genocide is never repeated.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Perceptions of Childhood Obesity and Public Support for Childhood Obesity Interventions: A Comparison of Parents in Japan and Colorado</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jacobs, Erica</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The rate of adult and childhood obesity has doubled and in some countries tripled worldwide over the last few decades. The rise can likely be attributed to an assortment of factors such as an increase in the amount and accessibility of soft drinks and processed foods (increased energy intake) and less time spent exercising inside and outside of schools (decreased energy expenditure). A body of research exists on the public’s awareness of obesity in the United States, but limited research has been done on the perceptions of obesity in Japan. A survey using the Qualtrics software was sent to parents in Japan and in Colorado to understand the differences between perceptions in these locations (n=71, Colorado=47, Japan=24). T-tests and an ANOVA test revealed that parents in Colorado view obesity as a greater problem than parents in Japan. Parents in both Colorado and Japan believed increased energy intake (fast food, junk food, and soda consumption) significantly contributed to childhood obesity and believed that parents were primarily responsible for reducing the problem. Fewer parents in Japan believed watching television and playing video games and spending time on the Internet contributes to childhood obesity than parents in Colorado. More parents in Japan believed a lack of places to exercise contributes to childhood obesity than parents in Colorado. Tax based interventions were least supported, and school-based interventions were most supported by parents in both locations. There were significant differences between concern for drug abuse, violence, drinking, sex, and smoking amongst parents in Japan and Colorado, which warrants further research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigating Interactions of the PKCα C1B Domain with Lipid Bilayers and Activators: An EPR Site-Directed Spin-Labeling and Relaxation Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Miller, Iain M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It has been previously shown that activation of PKCα on the leading edge membrane of a polarized chemotaxing cell contributes to a positive feedback loop that sustains leading edge formation and facilitates eukaryotic cell movement. As a result of its vital role in this process and other known signaling pathways, PKCα has been studied to better understand both normal cell function and the various diseases in which PKCα is an important player, including cancer. A recent single molecule study on PKCα has shown that, once bound to the membrane bilayer, the PKCα C1B domain plays a critical role in the final step of kinase activation on the target membrane. Specifically, C1B is recruited to the membrane by its binding to the activating lipid diacylglycerol (DAG) to activate the kinase. However, the key interactions of C1B with the lipid bilayer and its known lipid activators including DAG and phorbol esters are still under investigation. In this study, EPR site-directed spin labeling and power saturation measurements were employed to determine membrane insertion depth values for the PKCα C1B domain on simple lipid bilayers containing PC and PS in the presence and absence of known lipid activators DAG and PMA (the latter a phorbol ester). These depth values were then compared to protein-to-membrane depth values previously obtained through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the C1B domain by others, and to diffusion rates previously measured for C1B bound to the same lipid mixtures by others. All three approaches yielded a common trend in binding depths for C1B, indicating that C1B adopts a shallow docking depth when bound to PMA and a deeper docking depth when in a membrane-bound, activator-free state or bound to DAG on the lipid membrane bilayer. The present EPR-determined membrane depths provide the most direct measure of this shallower docking geometry on PMA-containing membranes. The shallow geometry may well play an important role in the higher affinity of C1B for PMA compared to DAG, where additional membrane penetration may have an energetic cost.  The higher affinity for PMA superactivates PKCα and plays a central role in well established ability of phorbol esters to promote tumor formation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>High Frequency Decomposition and Trade Arrivals</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kent, Alexander</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Typically, the prices of financial assets are studied over fixed-time intervals such as the case with monthly or daily returns. Modern technology now allows us to consider each transac- tion that occurred throughout a trading period and the particular instance in time at which it was placed. Statistical analysis of financial assets conducted at this level is referred to as high frequency econometrics. This microscopic view of the market allows us to observe an asset’s price formation process in continuous time. High frequency data is marked by a number of peculiarities that do not persist in discrete-time financial data, thus requiring a different econometric approach in order to preserve the vast amount of microstructure information embedded in the transaction data. In this paper, we construct and specify the joint probability distribution of price movements and trade arrivals as a compound Poisson process to build a theoretical framework to study the interplay of volatility and the timing of trades. We extend the price decomposition model proposed by Rydberg and Shephard (2003) by defining the magnitude of price change process to follow an adaptation of the autoregressive conditional multinomial–a finite state, VARMA model originally developed by Engle and Russell (2005). Furthermore, we define the trade arrival process to be a doubly-stochastic Poisson process (or Cox process) and propose estimating its random intensity through kernel density estimation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Letter Detection and Reading Aloud</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zangara, Tessa</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Subjects were asked either to circle all the e’s in a passage or to read a passage aloud. There were four different passages, which included either the word the in prose, one in prose, the in scrambled text, or one in scrambled text. Some subjects silently read a passage viewed on paper and performed letter detection by circling all the e’s they noticed (letter detection). Other subjects read aloud a passage viewed on a computer screen (reading aloud). In the reading aloud task, the words the and one were repeated in some of the sentences of the passage. The number of missed e’s or missed repeated words was recorded. We expected letter detection and reading aloud to be explained by different processes within the Guidance Organization (GO) Model of reading (Greenberg, Healy, Koriat, &#38; Kreiner, 2004). Specifically, we expected letter detection to be explained more by unitization processes (Healy, 1994) and predicted slightly more misses on the frequent word the than the less frequent word one (both words are relatively common) and no difference between prose and scrambled text. Alternately, we expected reading aloud to be explained more by structural processes (Koriat &#38; Greenberg, 1994) and predicted more errors on the function word the than the content word one and more errors on prose than scrambled text. Our results are consistent with our predictions and an overall analysis of task, word, and text type indicates that there are significantly different patterns of misses for letter detection and reading aloud.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PoliSee, PoliDo? Examining the Inter-Municipal Communication of Climate Action Policy and Strategy</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sandoval, Emily Raquel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This undergraduate thesis provides an examination of inter-city communication regarding climate change policy in the United States. It examines some of the existing literature regarding municipal climate action, policy dissemination, and existing formal communication networks for cities. Through the results of a 20-question survey sent to municipal employees specializing in climate action policy design and implementation, this thesis analyzes whether communication exists between cities and if so, how such communication relates to other city characteristics. The thesis finds that cities are in general communicating directly with and researching the policies of their peers using a variety of media and methods, but several factors including education, climate action prioritization, and optimism regarding the global impact cities make on climate change correlate with varying degrees of communication frequency and quality.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Stressor Controllability on Corticostriatal Activity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Trahan, George</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The degree of behavioral control that an organism has over a stressor potently modulates the neurochemical and behavioral consequences of that stressor. Many stress-induced outcomes that occur following uncontrollable stress (e.g., exaggerated anxiety, reduced social exploration) do not occur if the identical stressor is controllable. Furthermore, having control over a stressor (time A) also alters an organism’s response to future adverse events (time B), even those that are uncontrollable. Pharmacological studies have identified the prelimbic region (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) as necessary for the short and long-term protective effects of behavioral control. Here, we combine PL-to-DMS pathway labeling with fluorescent retrobeads and immediate-early gene immunostaining in order to determine if the dimension of control selectively activates this pathway at time A and/or time B.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Men Cry: Embodiments of Masculinity in Western Cinema circa 1999</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lotterhos, Forrest Hamrick</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis examines two films released in 1999, Fight Club (Fincher 1999) and Boys Don’t Cry (Pierce 1999), through the theoretical framework of queer theory, gender theory, and feminist theory to analyze systemic structures and cultural notions of masculinity. Mainstream cinema depicts gender identity and gender roles to promote bigenderism and maintain patriarchal hierarchy. Rarely films and the characters within them break out of this ideological norm. By depicting masculine identified characters who cry, Fight Club and Boys Don’t Cry expose the characters’ vulnerabilities and flaws and challenge the “perfect masculine ideal.” These films question what it means to have a masculine identity when the characters behave in a way that is counter to normative patriarchal masculine identities. As a transgender masculine identified person, I have a unique interest in masculine identity formation and a personal desire to explore different embodiments of masculinity. Examining research conducted in the transgender community through social media sites and online forums and providing insight from my own life, this paper elucidates ideas about hormonal and biological processes related to sex and gender characteristics and identifications. A critical analysis of the cinematic and written texts of Fight Club and Boys Don’t Cry through the lens of personal experience, this thesis addresses concepts of fluidity in male identified characters in scenes in which they cry and what this act says about them and about masculinity. Further, it exposes the failures and dangers of streamlining boys and men into normative patriarchal masculine identities and practices.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effect of Judicial Elections on California Tort Law: A Study in Public Choice</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rodriguez, Patrick</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis examines the relationship between contested judicial elections and the value of total damages in product liability trials. For years, legal scholars have argued that judicial elections pose a direct threat to a judge&#39;s impartiality, but this thesis is one of only a few studies to observe judicial elections&#39; quantitative effects on the application of law. Narrowing the focus of this thesis to a set of particularly competitive California Superior Court elections in 1982, this thesis evaluates judicial behavior through difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff) analysis. The major findings of this study are as follows: 1) Controlling for relevant variables, contested judicial elections are associated with a statistically significant increase in product liability awards stemming from Californian jury trials. 2) I conclude that legal economists must tailor empirical analysis to the practical as well as institutional incentive structures facing elected judges. 3) Finally, I suggest a theoretical model of judicial vote-maximization to inform future research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Capital Punishment: A Philosophical Rejection of Punishment by Death</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mangan, Taylor</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Experiencing ubiquitous contention, the correlation between execution as a form of legal punishment and morality pervades in the modern era to form a central concern for examination. Competing accounts of moral theories have provided dichotomous vindications for capital punishment, indicating a substantial strife in criminal justice morality. This thesis will examine these rival philosophies in order to assess the gravity of moral theories in Supreme Court decisions. In particular, both consequentialist and retributivist theories are analyzed with respect to their conceptualizations of punishment. After examining the death penalty’s legal history and the components of morality inherent in Supreme Court decisions, I assess that both consequentialist and retributive moral theories cannot account for the justification of the death penalty. Overall, an inherent association between morality and legal decisions is revealed that affirms that philosophy calls for the abolishment of capital punishment.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The True Cost of SIPs: A Comprehensive Tool for Comparing the Price of Residential Structural Insulated Panel and Stick Frame Construction</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Meis, Adam</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Increasing the quality of a home generally increases the cost of construction; however, Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) illustrate one innovation that may be able to break this rule. Can a smallscale home that is stronger and more energy efficient be built in less time and with less construction waste for the same lifespan cost as traditional stickframe construction? Small scale residential construction does not benefit from an economy of scale that helps reduce the cost of SIPs in larger homes, this study assesses whether costbased design decisions can offset the monetary savings from this economy of scale. This study determines the cost per material square foot for nine building elements common to residential construction by incorporating the point in time price of six major category costs. These building element costs are then compiled into a usable, designbased comparative cost matrix tool that allows architects and contractors to assess whether a small scale home design can be constructed with SIPs at the same cost as a typical stick frame structure. Three example homes priced with the matrix conclude that the cost to frame a small scale residential houses with SIPs is approximately 10% greater than stick framing. This additional cost means that SIP manufacturers need to decrease the material cost of Structural Insulated Panels if they are to be comparable in cost to typical stick frame construction for small scale residential homes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Optical Delusions:  Questioning and Shifting the Cyclical Nature of Human Choice, Time, and the Behaviors of the Greater Universe</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pietruszka, Emily</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Optical Delusions is an eighteen-minute dance performance piece that inquires, and quite literally smashes delusions that have become deeply rooted in the human understanding of personal choice and the concept of time. Inspired by the writings and teachings of physicist Brian Greene and the theories of philosopher and composer Friedrich Nietzsche, melded with my own experiences in harnessing the power of choice, the audience finds themselves questioning the nature of the circles that inherently exist in our universe. The nature of the circles comes to life as the piece utilizes a loop pedal machine following a live-feed, projected feedback loop that brings the space to life. Using mirrors as a metaphor for perception and beyond, the dancers interact with pieces of glass strewn across the space. They are also seen obliterating their own reflections in projected video images. Throughout my process I ask the critical question, how can we initiate change in the perpetual circles that inherently dominate our lives?</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Poujade and Poujadolf: Fears of Fascism in France’s Fourth Republic</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Owczarek, Wojciech J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Poujadist Movement, which began as a protest of shopkeepers in southern France in 1953 and rose to national prominence in the elections of January, 1956, was, at the time of its political activity, accused by its critics of fascism. While analyses of the Poujadists have generally focused on the movement’s ideological characteristics to evaluate its possible fascism or its classification as a member of the French far right, I look at Pierre Poujade and the label of fascism in the context of the postwar political climate and the politicized memory of the French Resistance. In addition to analyzing charges of fascism originating on the left of the political spectrum, among the members of the French Communist Party, I evaluate similar accusations voiced by members of the Gaullist right. Noting that the myth of the Resistance served as a source of postwar legitimacy among both the followers of Charles de Gaulle and the Communists, I argue that, by accusing the Poujadists of fascism, the two extremes of the Fourth Republic’s parliament were seeking to tap into the anti-fascist narratives that informed their political lineages in order to attempt to regain governmental participation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Ethyl Oleate on the Behavior of Apis mellifera</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hussein, Abdullahi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The pheromone ethyl oleate was recently discovered in honeybees and has offered researchers the opportunity to further understand how division of labor is managed in honeybee (Apis mellifera) societies. Biologists recognize two types of pheromones: Releaser pheromones, which elicit immediate responses from receiving animals, and primer pheromones, which cause long-term changes in behavior without immediate behavioral change. The pheromone ethyl oleate used in this study acts as a primer pheromone in honeybees. The behavior of guard bees was examined after direct exposure to ethyl oleate, by recording the number of treated bees present in the hive. The number of bees present inside and outside the hive was recorded once daily for three days after exposure of guard bees to ethyl oleate. A control group was also maintained to compare the result to the treatment group. This research was conducted in the summer when bees are most active. No significant difference was seen in the number of control and treatment bees present, indicating no behavioral change after exposure to ethyl oleate. However, a significant decline in the number of bees occurred over time, with the lowest number of bees recorded on the third day. More control bees were found inside and outside the hive during early summer, while more treatment bees were observed in late summer. In the future, tagging more bees, conducting the entire study early in the summer and spending more time observing and tracking bees in the hive would improve such studies. Improved delivery methods of ethyl oleate to the bees and a means to measure the concentrations of ethyl oleate in bees would also be helpful.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sex is the Warmest Color: Intimate Relations of Power and Truth in England and Thailand</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Valershteyn, Maria</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Substitutive sexuality….the infinite cannot be made into matter, but it is possible to create an illusion of the infinite: the image…and skin, a mass of scars, a skeleton’s robe…but they certainly are truth.
– Andrei Tarkovsky, ‘The Sacrifice’
This honors thesis outlines the importance of sexuality and its connotations in the political as well as social sphere of society. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the underlining reasoning within people and states using a sexual discourse. By applying Michel Foucault’s theory of sexuality and relations of power, a description of a society’s system solely based on sexual activity and identity is constructed, and argued to be woven into each individual by culture, specifically religion. An attempt to present culture as an explanation for a state’s behavior is depicted, by looking at how religious ideology of a society influences immigration policy, and furthermore, voluntary sex work and either the sexual openness or censorship in two states, England and Thailand. To collect significant data, literary research was applied to the area of public opinion, in which amount of sex bars, sexuality in magazines, and women’s rights groups’ involvement were measured in both regions since the new millennium. Results signify the importance of culture, specifically religion, in forming a subject’s perception about sex within one’s-self and the sexual expectations of society. Conclusions reveal the importance of culture seen in state’s behavior through the prescribed sexual norms, ideals, and values given to each individual at birth, and emphasize that the religious sexuality of a society is the conduit of truth for political and social power relations and state activity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Search for a Highly Efficient Long-Wavelength Photoinitiator by Increasing Aryl Conjugation: From Computational Design, Characterization, and Potential Application</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wagner, Justine S</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Currently, dental composites are limited to layer-by-layer deposition due to depth curing limitations using blue light. In dental composites, monomers are polymerized by light with the presence of photoinitiators (PI).  Free-radicals, which promote polymerizations of vinyl monomers, are formed when PIs are excited by irradiation (either UV or visible light). A widely used photoinitiating system in the dental industry consists of a combination of camphorquinone and ethyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate. The drawback in the usage of this method is the yellow coloring and stability of these PIs. There is a current demand for a PI that initiates curing in the visible light with high efficiency. This demand is not only needed in the dental industry, but also in fields such as laser 3D printing and regenerative medicine. In this study, three new photoinitiators (2-Naphthacene (APO), 9-Anthracene (APO), and 9-Anthracene (BAPO) were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for its potential application for visible light curing. UV-vis spectroscopy results show that increasing the aromaticity of the PI increases the wavelength of absorption as well as the molar extinction coefficient. However, IR kinetics and Real Time UV-vis spectroscopy results show that the efficiency of the radicals from the photoinitiators are drastically infringed based on the stabilization effect occurring on the radicals. These above mentioned PIs can help us understand the design of a PI with greater efficiency in the visible light curing. In addition, they may potentially replace the current initiating systems used in the dental industry as well as other photochemistry based fields.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Rpt6 Tail influences the Competition between Nas6 and Core Particle in Proteasome Assembly</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Li, Frances</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The 26S proteasome is a molecular machine for regulated protein degradation in eukaryotes. In order to build a functional proteasome, proper assembly between the 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP) and 28-subunit core particle (CP) is very crucial. RP assembly relies on four evolutionarily conserved chaperones: Nas6, Rpn14, Hsm3, and Nas2 (1-4). These chaperones bind to RP and prevent their premature interaction with CP. However, it is unknown what controls the switch between chaperone-RP state and CP-RP (proteasome holoenzyme) state. In this project, I focus on the Nas6 chaperone to understand how Nas6 and CP compete for RP to achieve successful assembly of the proteasome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I also examine potential factors that can further shift the competition between Nas6 and CP to probe how cells coordinate proteasome assembly with metabolic states in cell.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Harvesting Healthier Generations: Improving Childhood Health Through School Gardens and Farm-to-Cafeteria Lunch Programs</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bernstein, Olivia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This report explores the current childhood obesity health crises in the United States and the potential solutions of school garden and farm-to-cafeteria lunch programs. The study of school garden and farm-to-cafeteria lunch programs investigates an environmental problem from a health outcomes perspective. Previously published, accredited scientific articles are systematically reviewed to identify both the success and failures of these programs, in addition to defining areas needing greater research. The research and data collected in the systematic review is later used to suggest a set of best practices for school garden and farm-to-cafeteria lunch programs. School garden and farm-to-cafeteria lunch programs offer viable solutions for the obesity epidemic that necessitates a change.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Microscale Temperature Fluctuations In The Boulder Valley</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brauer, Noah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is well known that there are often drastic temperature variations within very short distances. Although the locations of these fluctuations can generally be predicted by analyzing factors such as topography and wind velocity, there are some cases where there are exceptional changes in temperature without an obvious reason. Understanding the causes behind these extreme temperature variations will help improve weather predictions that may ultimately influence important components of society such as agriculture and transportation. The Boulder Valley is an ideal location for the study of microscale temperature fluctuations due to its unique topography and spatial variation in terrain. This research will examine the several possible factors that influence large temperature variations over short distances. This will be tested by using a weather station that is mounted on a bike to record temperature variation within the Boulder Valley.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Lars von Trier’s Trinity of Negativity: Nature, Chaos, and Downward Momentum in Antichrist</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Newton, Meghan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis explores the dense symbolic world of Lars von Trier’s Antichrist through theories of the grotesque. I will argue that Antichrist confronts a repressed cultural ideology regarding dangerous femininity that continues to inform modern Western culture. By recreating the Biblical fall in the fictional realm of “Satan’s church” von Trier exposes the historical gendering of the threatening aspects of nature—chaos, death, and evil—as feminine in Christian theology. But, while this distorted Christian creation myth frames the story, the interaction between the two protagonists, “He” and “She,” reflects familiar discourses of modern gender politics. Antichrist exposes the underlying cultural anxiety around women’s bodies that continues to motivate modern sanctions on female sexuality and reproduction as echoes of archaic, misogynist perceptions of femininity. Von Trier uses the female grotesque motif to confront this cultural anxiety around female sexuality, rather than to promote it. Antichrist inverts Christian iconography and myth to subvert the hierarchical gender roles that Christianity has historically helped to construct.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Truth About Organic: Sustainability, Practice, and Perception</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Baker, Keli</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is an essential goal of conservation biology to find a way to sustainably meet the food needs of an exponentially increasing population without damaging the environment and the ecosystem services it provides us. The difficulty with “sustainable agriculture” is that there is much disagreement as to what it entails and how to approach it. Thus far, the organic movement has dominated practices and perceptions in the realm of alternative farming practices. Proponents of organic food production claim that it is more beneficial for the environment, as well as the humans and animals that inhabit it. However, some research has shown that organic food production can be more resource intensive and have a larger effect on the environment than conventional methods. At its conception, the organic food movement was associated with a production process that was small scale, environmentally friendly, and socially conscious; but, modern organic food production has been industrialized and now involves many of the same processes as the conventional food production system it set out to oppose. The consensus among the literature is that organic, as it is defined in any regulatory or certification system, is not inherently sustainable. The sustainability of organic depends on factors other than specific processes defined by organic legislation, including regional climate, pre-cultivation soil conditions, distribution techniques, access to fresh water, topography, and other site specific alternative farming practices used in a given organic system (zero tillage, crop diversification, closed nutrient cycling, local sourcing, these are practices not defined or prohibited in organic laws). Most scholars agree that farming techniques must be specific to land conditions, regional culture, and related factors, and that many practices must be combined with organic to achieve the highest degree of sustainability. This thesis evaluates the sustainability of organic based on environmental and social impacts in the existing policy context.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>c-fos Expression in Rodent Model of Traumatic Brain Injury and Anxiety-Like Behavior</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kornreich, Elise</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts over one million people in the United States every year and significantly increases an individual’s risk of developing a psychiatric disorder.  Previous research in our lab has highlighted the role of neuroinflammation in TBI and the development of post-injury anxiety in rodent models.  The objective of this study is to characterize the brain regions involved in the anxiety-like behaviors observed in previous studies and in an immediate shock paradigm. The rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: LFPI+shock, LFPI+no shock, naïve+shock, naïve+no shock, sham-operated, and LFPI+MN166.  Lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) was used to model TBI in the rodents and shock refers to animals that were shocked in the immediate shock paradigm.  The expression of c-fos was measured and compared between groups across multiple brain regions including the hippocampus, insula, amygdala, paraventricular nucleus, central gray, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and regions of the prefrontal cortex.  The LFPI+shock rats displayed significantly higher freezing behavior in the immediate shock paradigm than all other treatment groups.  The results of the c-fos expression measurements partially support previous findings on brain regions involved in anxiety, but are not consistent with the expected pattern of activation based on the behavioral results of the immediate shock paradigm.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Warrior-King and the Shield-Maiden: The Reconstruction and Evolution of the Warrior Identity from Medieval Literature to Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lambek, Eva</dc:creator>
<dc:description>It is unquestionable that the modern fantasy genre builds heavily upon medieval literature. Many works in the genre are medieval quest adventures, where the central hero battles evil with the fate of their world at stake. This is largely due to the influence of medieval scholar and novelist JRR Tolkien, whose work is regarded as the beginning of the modern fantasy genre. In order to explore the fantasy genre, this study will look at the construction of the warrior identity in medieval literature and analyze how Tolkien has reconstructed and evolved the warrior identity. Through two medieval texts, the Old English epic Beowulf and the Icelandic Saga of the Volsungs, this study analyzes two medieval warrior identities, the warrior-king and the shield-maiden, to compare Tolkien’s medieval sources with his epic, The Lord of the Rings. The warrior-king Beowulf is compared with Tolkien’s character Aragorn in order to examine the prototypic male warrior. Beowulf is the ultimate warrior-king, yet his story ends with his death in battle and his entire dynasty crumbling. Aragorn is modeled on Beowulf, but is also evolved in a way that makes him more of a leader and thereby stabilizes the identity. The shield-maiden role is portrayed in medieval literature through Grendel’s mother in Beowulf and Brynhild in The Saga of the Volsungs; it is reconstructed and evolved in Tolkien through the noblewoman and shield-maiden Eowyn. The shield-maiden identity is one of malleability and often serves as an exception to the order of the fantasy world, therein creating a space for dual identities. Ultimately, this study aims to describe how the warrior is constructed in medieval literature and then evolved in Tolkien’s fiction, thereby showing how fantasy creates a malleable space for the reconstruction and exploration of identities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Faith and Terror: Religion in the French Revolution</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kalthoff, Maura</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis explores expressions of Catholic belief and practice during the Radical Phase of the French Revolution. Religion was one of the most contentious issues of the Revolution and the government&#39;s treatment of it was one of the major causes for popular discontent and even counterrevolution. As the Revolution turned more radical it became more dangerous to follow traditional Catholicism, yet dechristianization did not end its practice. The goal of this study is to understand the ways in which French men and women were able to maintain their faith despite the government&#39;s increasingly hostile approach to dealing with religion. It utilizes three main primary sources from individuals of varying social class and circumstance to illuminate the struggles of Catholics throughout France during this time of upheaval. Overall this study  will show that through small acts religious practice was able to withstand state-sanctioned suppression.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Improving Children&#39;s Inhibitory Control: Effects of Prior Task Instructions versus in-the-Moment Reminders</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Patterson, Elizabeth N</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Young children are notorious for being inadequate at stopping their automatic actions during tasks that require inhibition (Munakata et al, 2011). The mechanism by which we are able to inhibit those automatic actions is regulated by cognitive control, which is a set of processes that allow us to maintain goal-relevant behavior over the course of a given task. Previous research has established that there is a marked transition during childhood in the form of cognitive control that is deployed to aid during a given task (Chatham, Frank, &#38; Munakata 2009). Younger children are more in-the-moment thinkers while older children are able to anticipate a prompt and can therefore prepare an answer.  One particular study looking children’s cognitive control was constructed to assess which type of rule reminder during a task helped younger children to perform successfully throughout a task (Barker &#38; Munakata, in prep). This study found that cue-highlighting reminders throughout the task helped younger children with their performance. The present study seeks to investigate which category of reminder during a box-search task is most helpful to 3-4.5 year olds in inhibiting their automatic reactions, which is an extension of the Barker &#38; Munakata task. Our findings indicate that children did worse in go-trial tasks than expected across all conditions. In the no-go trial tasks, which are designed to test inhibitory control, in contrast to our hypothesis, children performed worse in the reactive reminder condition than the proactive reminder condition.  These results create interesting questions that can lead us to further research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Limits of Dionysiac Liberation in Euripides&#39; Bacchae</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Goggin, Marina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Scholars have frequently observed that Dionysus is a god who breaks down barriers (of gender, class, social norms, et cetera).  This is true in Euripides’s Bacchae to a certain extent, and the play’s breakdown of the divide between male/female and Greek/foreign has been well examined in scholarship.  However, the limitations of this questioning of boundaries are much less discussed.  For instance, while Dionysus frees the women of Thebes from their homes, he does not free slaves during the Bacchae.  In a play that places considerable emphasis on liberation and freedom, this is a curious omission.  The few slave characters in the Bacchae, like most slaves in tragedy, support their masters and the status quo.  However, the worshipers of Dionysus are also equated with slaves: Pentheus wishes to enslave them, and both the Theban bacchants and the chorus of Lydian devotees represent a kind of slavery to the god.  Far from any Dionysiac destruction of social norms, the identification of the Theban women with slaves actually reveals the limits of the Bacchae’s other explorations as well.  The women seem doomed by both femaleness and foreignness (the chorus is inherently foreign, the Thebans foreign by association with Dionysus) to be slaves either to Dionysus or to Pentheus.  I argue that this is symptomatic of the limitations of Dionysus’s breakdown of identities.  His questioning of barriers tends to be metaphorical rather than literal, and although he breaks down social identities in the Bacchae, he leaves social hierarchies securely in place.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Consequences of cell death in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster: potential implications for cancer treatments</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Delano, Angela</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster shares nearly 75% of known human disease-related genes (Pandey 2011). With its rapid life cycle, simplified genome, and widespread availability, this model organism provides a valuable entry point for cancer research in genetic studies and small-molecule drug screens. In humans, cancer treatments frequently involve the interchange of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in order to avoid overwhelming doses of a single method. Such regimens are administered in intervals to allow a recovery period for a patient’s integral, normal cell types. A recent study in Drosophila tissues found that these healing intermissions allow dying cells to confer enhanced survival to surrounding cells through a form of non-autonomous cell-signaling protection deemed “The Mahakali Effect” (Bilak 2014). Similar survival mechanisms have been identified in human cancer patients (Sun 2012), and the ability of tumors to acquire resistance to radio and chemotherapy contributes to over 90% of treatment failures in metastatic carcinomas (Longley 2005). The Mahakali Effect, named after a Hindu goddess of death who protects her followers, describes the process by which previously killed or damaged cells protect neighboring healthy cells from subsequent radiation damage. The genes Tie and bantam were found to be necessary for this protection (Bilak 2014), and this thesis aims to determine if these genes are employed in the protective mechanism by undead cells. Undead cells are those whose apoptosis (programmed cell death) has been initiated but not completed. This is achieved through the inhibition of executioner and pro-apoptotic caspases (Dischtel-Danjoy 2013). Apoptosis serves the essential function of destroying mutated, precancerous cells, so inhibition of self-destruction makes undead cells more susceptible to tumorigenesis (Don Ryoo 2012). The ultimate goal of this research is to contribute to the ongoing cancer drug development to inhibit the protective effect, so that rounds of cancer treatments involving cytotoxic drug therapy followed by radiation do not lead to progressively more protected and resistant tumor cells (Yu 2012; Bilak 2014). The results of this research suggest that Tie is not required for the protective effect in undead cells, while bantam appears to be important, yet not entirely responsible, for this effect. In this case, bantam has a permissive role rather than an instructive role, and the permissive threshold remains to be determined. Further gene candidate testing will be necessary in order to elucidate both the permissive and instructive components of cell-cell protection in undead Drosophila melanogaster tissues.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Innovations for a Campground Water System: A Biomimicry Approach</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Young, Courtney</dc:creator>
<dc:description>I have studied the forms of mycorrhizae and xerophytes to gain inspiration for a water system upgrade. This process of emulating natural forms and strategies is called biomimicry. The U.S. Forest Service is in the preliminary stages of an upgrade for an aging water system at the Prospector Campground in the White River National Forest. Forest Service engineers and designers will use my research as they redesign this system.
I looked at over twenty plants to find adaptations that helped manage water efficiently. I chose to study mycorrhizae and xerophytes because of their wide range and prevalence.
Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants. Mycorrhizae are successful water absorbers because of their extensive surface area and ability to alter osmotic gradients. A branched system with appendages decreasing in size will increase the amount of water absorbed. A well built with these principles would increase water available to campers.
Xerophytes are plants that thrive in low water environments. This is facilitated by many adaptations. A thick, waxy cuticle and small, low-density stomata reduce evaporation. Shedding of foliage saves water in times of drought. I suggest installing aerators with lower water flow on the spigots throughout the campground to reduce water use.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The BBC3 Antisense Intragenic Transcript, BAIT, Contributes to PUMA Expression by a p53-Autonomous Mechanism</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Michael, Nicole C</dc:creator>
<dc:description>p53 is a tumor suppressor protein which orchestrates cell cycle arrest or apoptosis to prevent the hyperproliferation of cells which could lead to cancer. However, when p53 is inactivated, which happens in over 50% of cancers, it fails to induce PUMA, a potent apoptotic protein. Loss of PUMA makes cancer cells less likely to undergo apoptosis upon stress stimuli. Recent GRO-seq data revealed unique antisense transcription initiated 6kb into the PUMA locus, creating a small noncoding RNA transcript dubbed BAIT (BBC3 antisense intragenic transcript). This project focused on understanding the expression and function of BAIT, which we hypothesized could modulate the expression of the sense PUMA transcript. Using a luciferase reporter vector we showed that the proximal TATA box near the transcription start site for BAIT is necessary to drive its expression. We found that BAIT is expressed in different cell types and BAIT levels fluctuate in response to different stimuli. Surprisingly, we demonstrated BAIT expression is independent of p53, as elevated levels were observed in HCT116 p53 null cells. Finally, we observed that BAIT expression decreased upon activation of p53 by Nutlin as compared to basal conditions, and when BAIT is knocked down, the predominant PUMA transcript variant decreased. This provides the foundation for future studies to determine a mechanism for how BAIT contributes to the regulation of PUMA expression, which could illuminate strategies to induce PUMA expression and apoptosis in tumors with inactive p53.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploring Climate Change Driven Shifts to Water Rights and Policy Along the Colorado River</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Scarr, David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The goal of this study is to evaluate the current discussion on how climate driven shifts in hydrology will affect water rights and policy on the upper Colorado River. Global and local temperatures have been increasing steadily. In certain areas of Colorado snowmelt has shifted earlier and is likely to continue to do so. Precipitation as snow is decreasing at certain elevations in the Rocky Mountains. Focusing on water users in the western slope of Colorado, these environmental changes suggest a number of shifts in river hydrology. There will likely be less overall storage as snowpack and possibly earlier more pronounced peak flows. It is expected that earlier flow timing could reduce the ability of senior agriculture users to apply water to crop irrigation. This in turn could increase the value of temporary transfer or fallowing strategies proposed to meet anticipated municipal and industrial water needs. Reduction of agricultural production in certain crops, or shifts to crops that use less water or can be irrigated earlier in the season could also be expected. Junior holders will be affected in potentially different ways. Initially as peak flows shift earlier junior rights holders such as fishing or kayaking industries may see a potential benefit in more water available earlier in the season. However, late season shortages as a result of flow shifts have the potential to exacerbate the value of senior rights. My approach is to combine a review of scientific literature, policy literature, and discussions with professionals and experts on these issues to produce an overview that identifies the most prominent issues and consequences concerning these shifts.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Oxygen Isotope Effect in High Temperature Superconductors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Rubeck, Samantha</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Conventional superconductivity is described by its interactions of electrons through a vibrational mode called phonons. For high temperature superconductors (HTS), the mechanism which explains its superconductivity is still unknown. Various measurement techniques have been established to study the mechanism behind HTS including looking at the effect of altering the mass of oxygen in the copper-oxide planes of cuprate crystal lattices from 16 g/mol to 18 g/mol, also known as the isotope effect. While the results of previous experiments are still inconclusive, I aim to investigate this effect using magnetometry, Raman spectroscopy, and laser angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in order to find evidence for a particular pairing mechanism.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Dermatoglyphic Asymmetries, Symptoms, and Cognitive Function in Adolescents at Ultrahigh-risk for Psychotic Disorders.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Russak, Olivia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A growing body of etiological research suggests that prenatal insult or injury can create a biological vulnerability for developing psychosis. When combined with genetic and environmental factors, these biological vulnerabilities can increase an individual’s chances of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. One marker of prenatal insult or injury that has been widely researched in schizophrenia, but not in ultrahigh-risk (UHR) populations, is dermatoglyphics, epidermal ridge patterns that form on fingerprints and palms. Dermatoglyphics form during weeks 14-22 of fetal development, a critical time for the formation of the central nervous system (CNS). One specific neural structure that is of interest in the context of psychosis is the hippocampus, as its structure and function has been implicated across the psychosis spectrum.  Further, hippocampal function is implicated in working memory deficits characteristic of individuals with psychosis, and the structure is highly sensitive during the prenatal period. In the present study, dermatoglyphics, symptoms, and cognitive data were collected on 59 UHR and 60 healthy control adolescents. The present study found elevated dermatoglyphic asymmetries within the UHR group as compared to healthy controls. No significant group differences were found in a spatial working memory task. However, elevated dermatoglyphic asymmetries were significantly associated with lower spatial working memory scores and increased attenuated symptoms but not with a more general measure of intelligence (recruiting from structures outside of the medial temporal region). The present study provides insight into prenatal vulnerabilities of a given UHR sample, and additionally supports a neural diathesis-stress model of psychosis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Genetic Relations of West Spanish Peak Stock, South-Central Colorado, with Surrounding Radial Dikes Containing Cognate Xenoliths and Miarolitic Cavities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ray, Stewart</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Spanish Peaks intrusive suite in south-central Colorado includes various mid-Tertiary intrusions, which includes the plutonic stocks of the Spanish Peaks themselves, as well as various dikes, sills, and volcanic plugs. This study specifically focuses on the relationship between the plutonic stock of the West Spanish Peak and a group of radial dikes centered on this mountain. The goal of this thesis is to determine if the radial dike swarm and the West Spanish Peak stock potentially share a common magma source based on their temporal, geochemical, and isotopic relationships.
The West Spanish peak is a holocrystaline quartz monzanite plutonic stock, and its surrounding hypocystalline radial dikes range from mafic to felsic in composition. Contained within the radial dikes surrounding the peak are cognate xenoliths and miarolitic cavities, features which have not been described in this geologic setting before. The holocrystalline cognate xenoliths in the radial dikes have gabbroic compositions. The miarolitic cavities are composed of a variety of both mafic and felsic minerals in concentric rims towards the center of the cavities. From the petrographic, major and minor oxide, trace element, and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic analysesI conducted on these samples, two major conclusions have been drawn. First, the West Spanish Peak stock, its surrounding radial dikes, and the cognate xenoliths included into the radial dikes are likely to be co-genetic, most probably forming from a single parent-magma body. Secondly, the miarolitic cavities in the radial dikes formed during a paleo-groundwater event, or series of events, which occurred after the emplacement of the radial dike swarm, but probably soon afterwards when the local groundwaters were still heated.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effect of miRNA-138 Injected into the Medial Habenula on Nicotine Intake and Preference</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fitzgerald, Kelsey</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Nicotine is one of the most commonly abused drugs in the world today and is associated with many adverse health outcomes, including death. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain reward pathway, triggering the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.  The goal of the current study was to determine whether miR-138, a miRNA that targets and reduces β4 subunit gene expression, injected into the medial habenula would lead to changes in nicotine intake/preference. We hypothesized that miR-138 would down regulate β4 expression, leading to decreased aversion to nicotine and increased nicotine intake/preference. Male and female C57BL/6 mice were unilaterally injected with an adeno-associated virus containing either miR-138 or a scrambled control miRNA sequence.  Mice were then given access to water and increasing concentrations of a nicotine solution. We measured overall fluid consumption as well as nicotine intake. Mice injected with the miR-138 showed a trend for reduced nicotine intake and consumption compared to controls. Preliminary results were not statistically significant, but suggest that miR-138 injected into the medial habenula does not affect nicotine intake/preference. The current results suggest that reducing the expression of β4 subunits in the medial habenula via miR-138 leads to reductions in nicotine reward-related behavior, which does not support our initial hypothesis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Comparison of Lipid-Anchored and Un-Anchored DNA in the Bilayer Environment</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mirhossaini, Roya</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Complexes of zwitterionic lipids such as phosphatidyl choline and DNA are a growing field of interest due to their potential to act as nonviral vectors for gene therapy. However, fundamental molecular interactions between these lipids and DNA are poorly understood. In this study, a few methods were employed to understand the difference in stability between DNA in bulk solution versus DNA anchored to a liposome surface. Förster resonance energy transfer was employed to capture real-time hybridization events of fifteen-mer DNA anchored to a phosphatidylcholine liposome surface. Circular dichroism was used to compare the effects of liposome interaction on DNA stability. In the presence of liposome, DNA showed a marked increase in DNA melting temperature as well as a structural shift from native B-form to a proposed B-Z intermediate form of DNA. In future works, single molecule experiments will be performed to better understand what interactions are dominating in the DNA-lipid system as indicated by quantitative data.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>How Energy Industry Special Interests Affect Renewable Portfolio Standard Adoption Rates: an Empirical Study</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Langhorst, Ryan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study explores how special interest spending from the oil and gas industry affects the adoption of Renewable Portfolio Standards.  These energy policies have been adopted in 29 states across the US, making them a popular policy choice for promoting renewable energy development.  I created a hazard model including both spending variables as well as political and energy potential variables to see if oil and gas industry spending would influence the adoption of these renewable portfolio standards between 1998 and 2010.  The model showed no effect on adoption rates due to oil and gas industry spending, but rather significant effects came from the party of the state legislature, and how much wind energy potential was in the state.  While measuring direct effects of campaign spending is always difficult, in this case it was clear that direct industry spending on gubernatorial races did not have an effect on adoption, but that doesn’t rule out other methods of spending on the issue of renewable portfolio standards.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>From the Holy Land to the Cloister: The Decline of Female Ascetic Pilgrimages in the Early Medieval West (c. 350-615)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Williams, Manon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper will focus on the mobility of ascetic women from late antiquity through to the early Middle Ages with a particular emphasis on the practice of pilgrimage. As seen in multiple primary source documents, religious women from the West were journeying to the Holy Land and beyond from the fourth through to the early fifth centuries. This practice, however, is mentioned remarkably less in accounts of religious women north of the Alps in the late fifth century onwards. Evidence of women undertaking pilgrimages to the Holy Land is sparse while their male counterparts continued to make such journeys. Although the monastic rules that cloistered women certainly did have an impact on the movement of religious women in the early medieval West as other scholars have argued, there are a variety of external and non-religious factors that also contributed to the decline of female ascetic pilgrimages. This thesis will aim to give a more complete answer to this decline by focusing on the functions that religious women played in their communities, which effectively bound them to those same communities. I will argue that the changing image of female sanctity from late antiquity to the early Middle Ages reflects the social, economic, and political transformations that were occurring from late antique Roman society to early medieval Frankish society, thus resulting in a different model for women to follow as well as a different focus in the vitae of early medieval religious women.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Expanding the Xenobiotic Hypothesis of Drug Reward and Reinforcement: Implications of TLR4 Dependent Cocaine and Methamphetamine Induced Neuroinflammation on Reward, Relapse, Priming, and Neurotoxicity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fabisiak, Timothy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Conventionally, cocaine is thought to exert its rewarding and reinforcing effects on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which is commonly referred to as the reward circuitry of the brain. Cocaine increases dopamine levels within the NAc by blocking dopamine reuptake by antagonizing dopamine transporters (DATs) on the VTA dopaminergic axon terminals. Traditionally, it is believed that with repeated cocaine use, this neuronal action causes neuroadaptations that underlie addiction. However, developments within the last two decades indicate that glial cells within the central nervous system’s immune system act as non-neuronal modulators of drug reward. It was recently found that cocaine interacts with the TLR4/MD-2 complex to produce a proinflammatory response, and that this interaction is necessary for cocaine reward. The present investigation proceeds to demonstrate that cocaine can directly activate microglia cells through TLR4, causing them to upregulate mRNA of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, within the VTA. Furthermore, cocaine-induced dopamine increases in the NAc depend on cocaine-induced IL-1β signaling within the VTA.  TLR4 and IL-1β are also important aspects underlying cocaine-primed reinstatement to drug seeking in a self-administration paradigm. In this self-administration model, repeated exposure to cocaine appeared to induce glial priming, and led to the expression of additional proinflammatory markers throughout the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, providing new targets for further investigation into cocaine reinforcement. The investigation was expanded to include another commonly abused psychostimulant, methamphetamine (meth), which has also been recently shown to interact with the TLR4/MD-2 complex. Here, it is shown that the meth-induced neuroinflammation revealed within the mesolimbic dopamine pathway is TLR4 dependent; however, unlike cocaine, meth reward and reinforcement may be driven by mechanisms other than IL-1β signaling. Comparisons between cocaine-induced and meth-induced neuroinflammation suggest that IL-6 may also be an important molecule in mediating mesolimbic dopamine pathway functionality. The present studies provide evidence that the rewarding and reinforcing effects of psychostimulants arise from synergistic mechanisms involving both direct neuronal actions and neuroimmune interactions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Provisioning on Behavior of the Allied Rock-Wallaby (Petrogale assimilis)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Roth, Melina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Wildlife provisioning, the feeding of wild animals, is often a component of wildlife tourism in Australia -- tourism provides an important revenue source for the economy and is forecast to continue and grow. Therefore, the study of wildlife provisioning is necessary to understand and minimize its adverse effects.
My study addressed the impacts of provisioning on one particular wild native species group -- a provisioned colony of allied rock-wallabies (Petrogale assimilis) on Magnetic Island in northern Queensland, Australia. Twice daily (morning and afternoon) for two weeks, data were collected on the behavior of the individual rock-wallabies before, during, and after tourist provisioning. During each of these 28 site visits, observations of the rock-wallabies’ behavior, human presence, and provisioning were recorded.
The behaviors of the observed provisioned rock-wallaby colony differed dramatically from those observed and reported by others for non-provisioned populations of this species. These other supporting findings are particularly important because my observations were limited by the duration of the study and individual observation.
Only one colony of a limited number of rock-wallabies was involved. My observations of provisioning are in agreement with past observations of provisioned colonies in reporting diurnal activities, high population density, and high levels of aggression and contact between the rock-wallabies both during and after provisioning. Provisioning is thus associated with competition under high animal density in a restricted area. Future controlled studies are needed to confirm cause-effect relationships in the impact of provisioning on rock-wallabies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Roman Social-Sexual Interactions: A Critical Examination of the Limitations of Roman Sexuality</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tyner, Kyle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis explores the dichotomy between sexuality and socialization in ancient Rome; namely how sexuality is expressed and communicated in Roman society as a whole. While modern perceptions seem to paint ancient sexuality as something significantly fluid, I postulate that the cultural openness to matters of a sexual nature actually hindered sexual expression by categorizing and compartmentalizing human sexuality to certain categories of conduct. In the first chapter I use, as the main scholarly frame of reference of my study, the magisterial work of J.N. Adams on, Roman sexual linguistics, but I expand upon his work by connecting sexual phraseology to Roman socialization using the latest advancements in academic linguistic theory. In this chapter I argue that Roman social-sexual evolution runs parallel to and is preserved by the linguistic evolution of Latin sexual constructions. Furthermore, I expand beyond the work of Adams and argue that sexual catharsis is the primary force driving both the social views on sexuality and the sexual traditions of classical Rome. In the second chapter I examine an eclectic range of primary sources (literary, epigraphic, art-historical, archaeological, etc.) through which I explore Roman sexual traditions such as marriage, prostitution, and homosexuality from a distinctly Roman perspective while comparing and contrasting those perspectives with both modern perceptions of ancient sexuality and current theories of modern sexual conduct. I argue that each, rather than facilitating sexual autonomy, serves to limit Roman sexuality by forcing Romans to comply with strict social expectations. After examining Roman sexuality in these ways, I conclude that Roman society developed a culturally consistent approach to systematically institutionalize sexuality in such a manner as to result in wide-spread sexual repression among all demographic subsets of Roman society.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Thru-hiking as Pilgrimage: Transformation, Nature, and Religion in Contemporary American Hiking Novels</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ptasznik, Anna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Thru-hiking is a phenomenon in which one walks long distances—sometimes 2,000 miles or longer—on journeys often spanning continents and lasting many months at a time. In this work, I ask whether thru-hiking can be considered a form of pilgrimage and what implications doing so might have in the study of religion and nature.
Using three popular hiking memoirs, I argue that thru-hiking is a form of pilgrimage because it emphasizes themes of transformation, community, and space. In doing so, I also find evidence for religious practice spanning beyond organized religion, pointing towards more diffuse and individualized forms of spirituality common to the United States. Secondly, I situate contemporary thru-hiking novels within a larger tradition of American nature writing, tracing distinct values around nature, the self, and society. Finally, I demonstrate the ways in which new media and technology influence the experience of long-distance walking.
As an activity that permeates popular media, thru-hiking not only serves as an important example of how values are reflected to society at large, but also of how depictions shape the values of those who consume it.  This investigation seeks to bring this forward, in addition to analyzing the religious dimension of thru-hiking.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Behavioral Baselines and Modeling in a Changing Climate: Relating Temperature to the Summertime Behavior of the American Pika (Ochotona princeps) in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wiebe, Meghan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Small mammals that make use of sub-surface microclimates may be able to adapt quickly to a warming climate by altering the level and timing of certain surface activities. For example, energy-intensive territorial defense or foraging activities might be shifted to cooler times of day. This hypothesis was explored using data on the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a small, diurnal lagomorph closely related to rabbits that uses rocky microhabitats for shedding heat between bouts of surface activity. Over three consecutive summers (mid-June to mid-August, 2012-2014), 94 observations (45 minutes each) were conducted involving N = 61 unique pikas, using a standardized protocol to record behaviors during continuous focal-animal sampling. During observations, data loggers were used to record shade temperatures in surface and sub-surface microhabitats available to the focal pika. Most observations were conducted at the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (NWT LTER) site in Boulder County, Colorado (USA), with the goal of comparing historical data from this site with contemporary and future data. Here, I report a contemporary, temperature-indexed activity budget for pikas in this area of the southern Rocky Mountains. Surface temperatures averaged 5-10°C higher than sub-surface temperatures during diurnal observations, and pikas spent two-thirds of their time below the surface. Modeling surface activity as a function of microclimate and microhabitat variables, sub-surface temperature was found to be able to serve as the basis of a significant predictor model. The average surface-sub-surface temperature differential was also found to a significant non-linear model, surface temperature (values ≤ 15°C). This suggests that a strong temperature gradient is more important when the surface temperature is greater than 15°C. This study provides a current baseline for studying any future shifts in pika behavior, by providing data on behavior and temperature variation within currently available microhabitats, and by characterizing how pikas respond to temperature at this point in time.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Comparisons on the Cantonese-English Language Use of Family Members in Bilingual Home Environments and of Teachers in Bilingual Classroom Environments</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Cheung, Shirley M.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examines the amount of Cantonese-English language use in two main language environments of preschool children enrolled at the Head Start centers in San Francisco, California. The objective of this study aims to investigate home and classroom environments of sequential, bilingual children who learn Cantonese (L1) from birth and English (L2) at a later age in school. The present study examined the L1-L2 use of parents (N = 64) and teachers (N = 9) in households and classrooms. Data regarding language use across family members and home activities were collected using questionnaires, and data regarding language use across school centers and classroom activities were collected using digital voice recorders. The language use of parents and teachers were each compared separately per dataset. Overall, L1 was reported to be the majority language used at home by all family members and across all home activities. L2 appeared to be used more across activities in the classroom but not across teachers. Results of the study suggest that L1 is maintained at home while school settings introduce and help develop the L2 of a dual language learner.

			<dc:title>Tomographic Reconstructions of Photoelectron Distributions from Strong-Field Ionization in Two-Color Circularly Polarized Laser Fields</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gopalakrishnan, Maithreyi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this experiment, we propagate superposed 800 nm and 400 nm circularly polarized driving laser fields and interact the combined field with argon gas—in doing so, we demonstrate strong field ionization from this interaction. We then use velocity map imaging and tomographic reconstruction techniques to look at the resulting photoelectron angular distributions. From this, we discover that if the driving fields are counter-rotating, we see low energy structures which indicate rescattering of electrons off of their parent atoms. The presence of these low energy structures offers the first experimental verification of the theoretical model describing how circularly polarized high harmonics are generated. I discuss in this thesis: the concepts of high harmonic generation and strong field ionization, the interest in circularly polarized driving laser fields for producing circularly polarized high harmonics, applications of circular x-ray light, a detailed explanation of our experiment, the specific role that I played, our results, and current projects and extensions to this experiment that I am working on presently.</dc:description>
