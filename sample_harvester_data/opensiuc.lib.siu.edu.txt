			<dc:title>Late Woodland Ceramic Decorative Styles in the Lewis Phase of the Lower Ohio Valley: An Investigation of Social Connectedness</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jackson, Wesley Albertus</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This research focuses on the nature and extent of social relationships between two Late Woodland Lewis phase villages, ca. A.D. 650 to 900, in southern Illinois and western Kentucky. These villages are the Cypress Citadel site in Johnson County, Illinois (111JS76), and the McGilligan Creek site in Livingston County, Kentucky (19LV197). Relationships between the two communities are examined through a detailed comparison of their ceramic assemblages, especially the decorated pottery. Chi square and Cramer&#39;s V statistics are used along with the social interaction and information exchange theories to determine the most likely to association between the sites. The results suggest a distancing of the social relations between these sites over their 250-year occupations. With a lack of firm temporal data, however, these conclusions are only a best-fit model. Other significant similarities and differences are noted which provide clues for future avenues of study.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Good Food: Local Project on Acceptance and Consumption of USDA Specialty Crops in Pre-School through High School Children in Southern Illinois</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Price, Chelsea Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Previous studies have shown that hands-on cooking classes focusing on fruit and vegetables, nutritional value, and food safety have increased fruit and vegetable consumption in children. Some of the most nutrient rich fruits and vegetables are classified as United States Department of Agriculture specialty crops. USDA specialty crops are used only for consumption and offer a variety of important vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Thus, children who are not receiving the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables each day are not getting the proper nutrition.  	The design of this study is a prospective cohort of 69 day care participants. The intervention targeted many topics: meal preparation, nutrition education, food safety, food cost, and benefits of buying local foods.  	After one month in the program, participants showed no change in fruit and vegetable acceptance or fruit consumption. Participants showed a decrease in amount of vegetables eaten &#34;yesterday&#34; after participation in the study. Further research should be done in the area of cooking classes for children living in rural communities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Study of Food Environment and Healthfulness of Diet in the Population Attending the Good Food: Local Program in Southern Illinois</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Haertling, Lanie Kae</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF LANIE HAERTLING, for the Master of Science degree in Food &#38; Nutrition, presented on December 9, 2013, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale TITLE: THE STUDY OF FOOD ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTHFULNESS OF DIET IN THE POPULATION ATTENDING THE GOOD FOOD: LOCAL PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Sara Long Roth Objective: Distinguish six attributes of the Good Food: Local program participants. Design: At the first class of each Good Food: Local course a survey was administered to all participants.    Subjects and Setting: The study included participants age 18 or older who attended a Good Food: Local event during the months of June to September, 2013. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analyses used to analyze the data include: frequencies, Cross tabulations, Spearman Rank Test and Pearson&#39;s Correlation. Results:  The population reported to consume more fruits and vegetables than the national average, live in close distance to a large grocery store, not be confined by cost when purchasing groceries and felt comfortable preparing meals from a recipe. The main barriers to purchasing local specialty crops are availability, convenience. and cost.  Conclusions: Results of this study can be used in developing future curriculums for programs increasing familiarity with local specialty crops.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>STRESS, HEALTH, AND SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION: A MIDDLE SICÁN CASE STUDY</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bader, Alyssa Christine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The relationship between biology, culture, and environment has been the subject of growing interest within the field of bioarchaeology. This study seeks to examine the nature of this relationship within the context of the Middle Sicán culture, a pre-Hispanic society which dominated much of the north coast of Peru from 900-1100 CE. A comprehensive osteological analysis of the individuals excavated from the site of Sicán by the Sicán Archaeological Project during the 2008 field season was conducted in August 2013. From this data, the author analyzed the relationship between social status inferred from the mortuary context and health. Skeletal indicators of stress and disease were used as proxies for health. The biocultural consequences of a prolonged drought and subsequent mega-El Niño event, which occurred at the end of the Middle Sicán period, were also examined.  The results of this study suggest individuals of lower social status may have experienced worse dental health, possibly as a result of differential access to food resources. Additionally, temporal changes in dental health suggest Middle Sicán elite individuals may have become increasingly stressed at the end of the Middle Sicán period. The combined effects of the prolonged drought and mega-El Niño event may have necessitated a dietary shift which affected the dental health of these individuals.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>SENSING THE PAST: ETHNOAESTHETICS AND MEMORY WITHIN OKLAHOMA CHOCTAW CULTURAL REVITALIZATION PROJECTS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Burns, Jennifer Lynn</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Collective memories and how they are enacted through sensual experience of the material world play a key role in maintaining group identities. Material creations like art or social activities such as sports incorporate the social ideals of both the past as well as present; these creations can transform feelings of personhood into socialized objects. This thesis examines some of the creative expressions found within Oklahoma Choctaw revitalization practices to better understand how people maintain cultural sensory embodiments after they have experienced extreme social dislocation. Through the examination of the senses from an ethnographic approach a researcher can possibly identify those areas of culture that become embodied over time. I will be examining previously written research, oral histories pertaining to the Choctaw origin, and key material expressions of Choctaw identity alongside the contemporary practices associated with the current Choctaw revitalization efforts in Oklahoma.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Comparison of the Dr. Robert Zingg Archaeological Collection to Early 20th Century Tarahumara Material Culture</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sutherland, Kayla</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this study, I examine the material culture of the Rio Fuerte Basket-Maker Phase (200 B.C. - 1000 A.D.) and Cave-Dweller Phase (1000 - 1600 A.D.) occupations in southern Chihuahua, Mexico, that is represented in the Dr. Robert Zingg Archaeological Collection. Zingg believed that the material culture showed a clear progression from the Basket-Maker Phase to the Cave-Dweller Phase, which he interpreted to indicate a relationship between these two phases, and that these phases were the precursors of the twentieth century Tarahumara. I test this hypothesis by comparing the artifacts in the Dr. Robert Zingg Archaeological Collection curated by the University Museum at Southern Illinois University Carbondale to the artifacts in the ethnographic Tarahumara Collection curated by the Milwaukee Public Museum. Following an evaluation of the archaeological and ethnographic material culture, I conclude that Zingg&#39;s hypothesis is only partially supported by the museum collections. Although the material culture of the later Cave-Dweller Phase is sufficiently similar to the material culture of the twentieth century Tarahumara to suggest a relationship between the two cultures, the earlier Rio Fuerte Basket-Maker Phase does not provide enough artifacts that show similarity with either the Cave-Dweller Phase or the twentieth century Tarahumara.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Second language reading strategies: Evidence from Vietnamese learners of English</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nguyen, Hanh Thi Bich</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Despite the fact that a considerable body of empirical research has been done to examine the role of metacognitive strategic awareness both in L1 and L2 reading, controversial findings have been reported. In addition, although a substantial number of studies have been conducted to investigate reading strategy use by English learners of various first languages, there is a lack of research involving Vietnamese ESL learners. The present study was designed in order to add to the existing literature new evidence about the second language reading strategies used by Vietnamese ESL learners. Particularly, three main aspects of reading strategy use were investigated: 1) the reading strategies that are most frequently used by Vietnamese ESL learners; 2) the reading strategies that distinguish high achieving readers and low achieving readers; and 3) the reading strategies that are significantly associated with performance on lower order and higher order reading questions.  	The participants of the study were 32 Vietnamese ESL college students in Vietnam.  The research instrument employed two tasks: a fourteen-item reading comprehension test and a five-point Likert scale survey of reading strategies (SORS). The reading test was used to divide the sample into a higher performing group and a lower performing group. The SORS was taken from Mokhtari and Sheorey (2002) and consists of 30 items which measure learners&#39; frequency of use of global, problem solving and support strategies when reading academic materials in English. The data was analyzed through descriptive statistics, multiple independent samples t-tests, and multiple regressions.   	The frequency analysis revealed a fairly regular use of reading strategies by Vietnamese ESL learners. Of the three types of strategies, support strategies were the most frequently employed, followed by global and problem solving strategies. Regarding strategies used by the higher and lower performing readers, the results revealed significant differences in the use of 5 global and 1 problem solving strategies. In addition, the study found that participants&#39; performance on higher order and lower order reading questions was significantly associated with a set of reading strategies. Specifically, 14 reading strategies were significantly correlated with performance on lower order reading questions and 22 reading strategies with performance on higher order reading questions. 	These findings have provided new evidence and insight about the use of reading strategies in second language reading, particularly focusing on the relationships between strategy use and reading performance and strategy use and type of reading questions.  Especially, the findings about the relationship between reading strategies and performance on lower order and higher order reading questions are novel, which fact, undeniably, requires further research in order for these findings to be validated and expanded.  	Finally, the present study&#39;s findings carry valuable pedagogical implications concerning the design of ESL reading curricula and the practice of teaching ESL reading strategies. Namely, curriculum designers and teachers should take into account the following issues: 1) the universality and uniqueness of ESL learners&#39; preferences for reading strategies; 2) the connection between strategy use and reading performance, and 3) the fact that effective performance on higher and lower order questions is correlated with the use of specific reading strategies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Use of Lexical Borrowings Among Saudis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alzahrani, Amal</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Lexical borrowing is a natural linguistic phenomenon that occurs when two or more languages come into contact. This study investigates the use of English lexical borrowing by Saudi people. It also looks at the reasons why the participants use these borrowed words. 	Participants were 30 Saudi nationals living in the U.S.A. They include students who are undergraduates, graduates, and newly arrived Saudis who study at (CESL). Also included were students&#39; spouses, who were not enrolled at any school. An online survey was used in the data collection. Participants were given 10 sets of words and two situations. They had to choose between an English borrowing and its Arabic equivalent in two different situations. They also had to explain briefly why they chose this word. Data were examined through descriptive statistical analysis and content analysis. Results show that when given a choice, Saudis use English borrowings more often than their Arabic equivalents. Also, participants prefer the English borrowing mostly because it is more common, modern and prestigious. Findings of this study may help us better understand how language grows and changes, providing future researchers with the patterns and comprehension needed for prospective analyses and investigations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>THE ACQUISITION OF THE ENGLISH VELAR NASAL /ŋ/ BY SAUDI SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH: ARE THERE DEVELOPMENTAL TRENDS?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Al Ahmari, Saleha Hussain</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study aims to examine the developmental acquisition trends of English nasal /ŋ/ by Saudi learners of English. According to the previous literature, the velar nasal /ŋ/ presents significant difficulties for learners of English, especially for Arabic speakers. The literature indicates that their most serious problem lies in their tendency to insert a stop after the velar nasal, such as singing /sɪŋɪŋ/ pronounced as [sɪŋgɪŋg]. Accordingly, this study aims to examine this claim by studying Saudi learners of English as a second language to find the types of committed errors, and the effects of length of residence and language use in diminishing such tendencies.  	For this purpose, participants representing two ranges of length of residence in the US (LOR &#60; 1 year and LOR &#62;4 years) were recruited. The instruments included both a demographic questionnaire and a production task. A list of English words ending with the velar nasal preceded by different vowels was given. Data analysis made use of speech analyzer, descriptive statistics, frequency analyses, and an independent t-test to see if there are significant developmental trends in the acquisition of the target sound.  	The findings of this study provide empirical evidence in support of some of the most well-known theories in second language acquisition, namely, Contrastive Analysis hypothesis (Lado, 1957), Markedness Differential Hypothesis (Eckman, 1977), and Language Transfer Theory (Odlin, 1986; Gass &#38; Selinker 1994). The absence of the marked velar nasal in coda position and the phonological rules of its use in the marked coda position caused many types of serious mispronunciations in Saudis&#39; oral production of English words that end in such a segment. Resulting types of errors stem from the negative transfer of the allophonic environment of the velar nasal in Arabic language. Such transfer decreases as the length of residence and L2 use increase.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PERCEPTION OF CONSONANT GEMINATION BY NATIVE ENGLISH LEARNERS OF SINHALA: THE EFFECT OF TRAINING</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Karunarathna, Lokeshwari Sandamali</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Consonant gemination as a phonological feature plays a major role in the Sinhala language. The absence of true gemination in English causes perception problems for native English speakers when attempting to distinguish minimal pairs in Sinhala created by gemination. This study examined whether native English learners&#39; difficulties in perceiving consonant gemination in Sinhala could be reduced by creating phonological awareness of it through formal training. Four native Sinhala speakers were asked to record thirty-two Sinhala minimal pairs. These recordings were used to set up the audio test instruments. Twenty-four native English speakers participated in the pre-test, a teaching/training session, and the post-test. The pre-test consisted of an AX discrimination task, where the subjects heard two stimuli (A and X) and had to decide if those two stimuli were the same or not. The 20-minute teaching/training session, which was the study&#39;s primary independent variable, was given to educate the participants about the gemination contrast in Sinhala. The same audio test was repeated as the post-test. The data analysis included descriptive statistics and a t-test for dependent samples through SPSS statistics version 20. The findings of the study showed a significant difference between the pre-test and the post-test. The data also revealed the teaching/training session to have a high level of effectiveness regarding gemination contrast.  Perception of the gemination contrast had increased in the post-test, while perception of words without this contrast had decreased in accuracy, possibly as a result of hypercorrection.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>THE EMOTIONAL WEIGHT OF POETIC SOUND: AN EXPLORATION OF PHONEMIC ICONICITY IN THE HAIKU OF BASHŌ</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Miller, Rachel Marie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper proposes that SOUND SYMBOLISM, and more specifically PHONEMIC ICONICITY, plays a role in conveying emotional weight in the context of poetry. Previous research has indicated that the ratio of plosives to nasals in poetry predicts overall perception of emotional affect, with plosives designating activity and pleasantness, and nasals designating inactivity and unpleasantness (Auracher, Albers, Zhai, Gareeva, &#38; Stavniychuk 2010); however, this research has ignored the influence of such potentially mitigating factors as orthography and lexical meaning. The current study involves naive English L1 speakers listening to recordings of selected haiku from Matsuo Basho&#39;s Oku No Hosomichi (`Narrow Road to the Deep North&#39;) in the original Japanese, and as such, the potential of orthography and lexical meaning to influence perception of emotion is eliminated.  After listening to each haiku twice, subjects were asked to rate the appropriateness of eight emotion words that ranged from active and positive to inactive and positive, and from active and negative to inactive and negative, on a five-point Likert scale. Emotion words were chosen on the basis of their respective positions on the Circumplex Model of Affect, in which each emotion is conceptualized in terms of its location along two intersecting axes measuring valence (negative - positive) and arousal (inactive - active) (Russell 1980). The selected words occupied regularly spaced positions along this two-dimensional circular model. Results indicate that plosive to nasal ratio may indeed play a role in the perception of emotion in poetry, particularly in the case of poems with high plosive to nasal ratios, which were perceived as markedly more active and positive than other poems. Wider implications of the discernible patterns of perception of emotional affect based on plosive to nasal ratio include the possibility that phonemic iconicity plays a role in general language processing.  As this research involves Japanese L2 phonemic perception by naÃ&#38;hibar;ve English L1 listeners, current L2 phonological perceptual theory is discussed, and taken into account in the analysis of the results. Specific consideration is given to the potential of English L1 speakers to perceive the Japanese rhotic /r/, which does not appear in English, as the plosives /t/ or /d/, and the Japanese affricate /ts/, which commonly appears syllable-initially in Japanese, but is much rarer in this position in English, as /s/ (Nozawa 2008). Future research on English L1 speakers&#39; underlying perceptual categorizations of targeted sounds in Japanese is also proposed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>NATIVE SPEAKERS&#39; REALIZATIONS OF WORD-INITIAL FRICATIVE + CONSONANT CLUSTERS IN ENGLISH NON-WORDS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sheppard, Samantha</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examines the role of voiceless and voiced fricatives as the first consonant in word-initial true consonant clusters and adjunct clusters. Specifically, this study sought evidence to determine whether the lack of voiced fricatives, such as /z/ and /v/, in English word-initial true and adjunct clusters is due to an active ban or an accidental gap in the language&#39;s phonotactics. This study also looked into whether the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ is the only fricative that can play the role of adjunct segment in word-initial adjunct clusters, or whether other fricatives, such as the voiced alveolar fricative /z/, or the voiceless and voiced labiodental fricatives /f/ and /v/ could also be adjunct segments in word-initial adjunct clusters. Fourteen native English speakers were asked to pronounce a list of non-words containing word-initial clusters with /s/, /f/, /z/, and /v/ as the first consonant and /r/, /l/, /n/, /k/, and /g/ as the second consonant. The clusters were chosen to represent different voicing statuses and places of articulation for the first consonant in the cluster, in addition to differing sonority distances between the first consonant and the second consonant of the word-initial cluster. The native English speaker productions were recorded and acoustically analyzed in order to determine the exact pronunciations each speaker used for each target cluster. The results were then statistically analyzed to reveal patterns. Results showed that the lack of voiced fricatives as the first consonant in word-initial position of true clusters in English is due to an accidental gap, due to the relatively numerous correct productions of such clusters. The the lack of voiced fricatives as the first consonant in word-initial position of adjunct clusters in English, however, is due to an active ban, due to the difficulty that the native English speakers had in correctly producing such clusters. This study also concluded that while /s/ is the only adjunct segment in English, /f/ could also play that role.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>SAUDI ESL LEARNERS&#39; USE OF VOWEL DURATION AS A CUE FOR THE VOICING OF THE FOLLOWING STOP</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alahmadi, Ahmed Abdullah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The current study tests the use of vowel duration as a cue for the voicing of the following stop by Saudi ESL learners. It is mainly constructed on the Language Transfer Theory (LTT) established by Gass and Selinker (1994), the Ontogeny Phylogeny Model (OPM) formulated by Major (2001), the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) developed by Best (1994, 1995), and the Speech Learning Model (SLM) developed by Flege (1995). The instrument contained 30 English monosyllabic minimal pairs of the type CVC. The participants, who were living in the US, consisted of two groups: 5 advanced Saudi ESL learners with linguistic knowledge and 10 advanced Saudi ESL learners without linguistic knowledge. Results showed that both groups of participants (those with linguistics background and those without linguistics background) were fairly accurate at predicting final voiceless Coronal and Dorsal stops after a shorter vowel. On the other hand, they both had equal difficulties predicting voiced stops in this environment. This would explain why participants in both groups overall seemed to be listening for the voicing status of the final stop and disregarding differences in vowel length as a predictor of that voicing. Individual participants, overall, were quite uniform in their responses regardless of any background in linguistics. This finding suggests that participants in both groups relied much more on the actual voicing of the final stops than they did on the length of the preceding vowel.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Testing the Validity of the PEAK Relational Training System in Assessing Language &#38; Cognition After Brain Injury</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Whiteford, Kristen Maryann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>As a field, Behavior Analysis lacks an evidence based solution to assessing and treating language deficits in individuals with brain injuries. Research suggests that using direct instruction with persons with brain injuries is the most effective approach for teaching skills. Research on the PEAK Relational Training System suggests it may be applicable to adults with brain injuries because it does not have an age maximum and it assesses and trains complex language skills. The purpose of the current research is to determine the PEAK Relational Training System&#39;s potential applicability in assessing language and cognition functioning in adults with brain injury. 20 adults with brain injuries served as the participants for this study. Using a Pearson Correlation, the relationship between performance on the PEAK assessment and the Ross Information Processing Assessment (RIPA-2), pre-morbid education levels, Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and the location of injury in the brain was analyzed. Significant relationships between PEAK and RIPA-2 scores and PEAK and number of years since injury were shown. Furthermore, implementation of the PEAK was shown to be highly reliable. The current research has shown the effectiveness of the PEAK Relational Training System Direct Training Assessment for adults with brain injury.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>THE REALIZATION OF FINAL STOPS IN INTERLANGUAGE: MORE EVIDENCE FOR UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Olsen, Michael Lee</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This master&#39;s thesis investigated realizations of typologically marked structures (word final stops) in the interlanguages of 15 ESL learners across Arabic, Brazilian-Portuguese and Japanese first languages (L1s). In general, previous theories of markedness (see Eckman&#39;s MARKEDNESS DIFFERENTIAL HYPOTHESIS and STRUCTURAL CONFORMITY HYPOTHESIS) and transfer (such as Major&#39;s ONTOGENY MODELS) were upheld in that more marked structures proved more problematic than less marked areas. Where uniformity of modification strategies was found, OPTIMALITY THEORY was implemented to illustrate process of acquisition undertaken during interlanguage development. In an isolated speech task, participants who demonstrated acquisition of more marked structures (ie., voiced final stops) were also successful with their less marked counterparts (voiceless final stops), but not vice versa. In connected speech, more advanced participants&#39; modifications of target structures (such as assimilation of voicing and place of articulation) were more similar to patterns exhibited by native speakers of the target language while less advanced participants&#39; productions (ie., lack of intervocalic voicing) were more reflective of their L1. These findings support the hypothesis that interlanguages adhere to universal grammar and, thus, behave as natural languages. Finally, future directions such as potential research of L1/L2 perception issues and pedagogical implications of the study&#39;s results are explored.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluating the Efficacy of ACT-Based Exercises and Realistic Training to Improving Staff Performance During Crisis Intervention Encounters</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Shayter, Ashley</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Use of restraint during crisis intervention is of great concern as these situations evoke stress responses in the direct care staff that respond to them. This stress response often leads to non- neutral reactions. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been used to effectively de- literalize task-related stimuli in individuals that share similar physiological symptoms of stress to those that direct care staff might experience during crisis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how an ACT intervention would improve direct care staff performance during crisis interventions and increase accuracy of incident report writing. Results indicated that four out of the six participants improved their performance following ACT training, while the most improvement was observed in accuracy in incident report writing. This study expands upon the limited research available on the utility of ACT in the workplace. Implications of this study suggest that ACT may be a beneficial intervention to increase staff performance during crisis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of the Maintenance of Dense and Lean Schedules of Reinforcement on a Behavioral Skills Training Package to Teach Social Skills to Adults with Developmental Disabilities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sjostrom, Anna Rose</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Study 1 evaluated the use of a behavioral skills training package (BST) to teach three adults with autism spectrum disorders job interview and conversation skills. Participants were asked to have a mock job interview and conversation with the researcher. Participants&#39; behavior was scored according to the conversation and job interview task analyses. The BST package included instruction, modeling, rehearsal, feedback, and reinforcement. A dense or lean schedule of reinforcement was assigned to each social skill based on performance during baseline. Social skills increased for all three participants when the BST package was implemented. Study 2 evaluated if dense or lean schedules of reinforcement affect maintenance of social skills. Two participants from Study 1 participated. Participants&#39; BST data from Study 1 was used as baseline, followed by a maintenance phase. During this phase no instruction, modeling, rehearsal, feedback, or reinforcement was provided. The effect of rate of reinforcement during baseline on maintenance was evaluated.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Assessing the Validity of Engagement-Based and Selection-Based Preference Assessments in Elderly Individuals with Dementia</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Quick, Amanda Jean</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The preference assessment literature has mainly focused on children and adults with developmental disabilities. To date, minimal research related to preference and reinforcer assessments has been conducted with the elderly population with cognitive impairment. This study assessed the predictive validity of engagement- and selection-based preference assessment formats with two types of reinforcer assessments. One of these reinforcer assessments was engagement-based, and the other one included a task. The participants were three elderly individuals at an adult day program with a formal diagnosis of Dementia and a score less than 24 on the MMSE. The first participant&#39;s top items in the each preference assessment were validated in both reinforcer assessments. The second participant&#39;s top items from the free operant and MSWO were validated with the engagement-based reinforcer assessment, but the other assessment produced variable responding. The third participant&#39;s top items were validated in three out of four reinforcer assessments.

			<dc:title>A COMPARISON OF STIMULUS PAIRING OBSERVATIONAL PROCEDURES AND MATCHING TO SAMPLE PROCEDURES WITH KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Buitrago, Sara Jan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Stimulus Pairing Observational Procedure (SPOP) is an incidental teaching type procedure that has shown success in teaching typically developing children to name, independent tacting in the absence of the verbal community following a history of listener and echoic responses.  The purpose of the current study was to compare SPOP and matching to sample procedures to determine the rate of acquisition for correct tact and listener responding , the rate of off task be avior, and  the rate of generalization to different settings, stimuli, and instructors. Results of the study indicate that correct responding  occurred at higher rates during MTS procedures than SPOP. The average rate of off task behavior was higher during SPOP sessions than during pre test, MTS sessions, or generalization probes for each participant. The results of the generalization probe may indicate that SPOP produces correct responding that increases or maintains during generalization, while MTS procedures produced more variable results.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Stimulus Equivalence and the Emergence of Topography Based Driving Behaviors on a Vehicle Simulator Task</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Blowers, Andrew Pierce</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This investigation assessed the utility of a selection-based instructional program in teaching relations between driving behavior and driving stimuli in addition to the emergence of topography-based responding. A selection-based instructional program was delivered to three individuals with intellectual disabilities and/or learning disabilities in order to teach participants relations of sameness between automobile operation stimuli and driving behaviors. Participants were directly taught relations between video models of vehicle operation, road sign outlines, and textual stimuli of road signs using a selection-based instructional protocol delivered via a computer program. Following mastery of the selection-based instruction the emergence of selection-based responding on symmetrical and transitive posttest probes at the mastery level was observed for all 3 participants. Furthermore, movement on posttest generalization vehicle simulator probe was observed for one participant.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>THE EFFECTS OF MANIPULATING ESTABLISHING OPERATIONS AND A TOKEN ECONOMY PROCEDURE ON THE ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO SHARE BETWEEN PEERS WITH AUTISM</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gilley, Caitlin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The current studies evaluated variables affecting sharing exhibited by children with autism spectrum disorder. The first study evaluated the effects of manipulating item preference on the level of assistance needed to exhibit sharing behavior for four children with autism. Item preference affected two participants&#39; percentage of independent sharing. Preference did not have as clear of an effect for another participant. However, sharing a more preferred item required more assistance (e.g., vocal prompts) to share. The fourth participant&#39;s percentage of independent sharing was not influenced by preference, and his independent sharing behavior was similar across item preference. The second study assessed the effectiveness of a token reinforcement procedure as an intervention for increasing independent sharing of high-preferred items for the two participants who did not independently share high-preferred items during study one. Independent sharing increased for both participants when the token procedure was in place and returned to baseline levels when it was removed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>NOVEL SILICA-POLYMER COMPOSITES AS POROUS SCAFFOLDS IN TISSUE ENGINEERING</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yuan, Yawei</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Bone tissue engineering is a rapidly developing area. Engineering bone typically uses an artificial extracellular matrix (scaffold); osteoblasts or cells that can become osteoblasts, and regulating factors that promote cell attachment, differentiation, and mineralized bone formation. Among them, highly porous scaffolds play a critical role in cell seeding, proliferation, and new 3D-tissue formation. In this thesis, innovative composites which combine biodegradable polymers (e.g. pectin, iota-carrageenan) and silica based gels are created. Comparing previous materials, this type material possesses appropriate mechanical properties (elastic modulus and compressive modulus) to match native bones. Excellent architectural property (e.g. porosity, pore size, interconnectivity, and pore-wall microstructures) of this type material is designed to promote cell regeneration. Consequently it is believed the innovative composites should be considered as an alternative for bone tissue engineering applications in the near future.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>EFFECTS OF ADDITION OF SMALL PERCENTAGES OF FLY ASH ON LIQUEFACTION CHARACTERISTICS OF SAND</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lama Tamang, Rakam</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Severe damages to physical infrastructures as well as lifeline facilities have been observed during past earthquakes. Saturated sands as well as sands containing fines liquefied. The effect of fines on liquefaction resistance of sand is not fully understood till today. The basis of comparison and types of fines are reported as important factors affecting effects of fines on liquefaction. The fly ash is non-plastic and finer. Hence, study of  liquefaction behavior of sand-fly ash mixtures may be helpful for the understanding of  effects of fines on liquefaction resistance. The objective of this study were (1) to investigate effects of addition of fly ash on pore water pressure generation and deformation characteristics of sand, (2) to study effects of confining pressure on liquefaction resistance of sand-fly ash mixtures, and (3) to study Youngs modulus and damping ratio of sand-fly ash mixtures. Stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests were performed on clean sand, fly ash and sand-fly ash mixtures containing 10, 20 % of fly ash. For the evaluation of effects of confining pressure in liquefaction resistance, three series of tests were conducted at 5, 10 and 15 psi initial effective confining pressures. The reversible shear stress was applied systematically by varying CSR (Cyclic Stress Ratio) from 0.1 to 0.5. But, the tests were conducted only in 5 psi effective confining pressure in case of pure fly ash. The results obtained from the tests were used to compare the effects on liquefaction resistance in terms of pore water pressure build up, deformation behavior and effective confining pressure. Based on the results, it was observed that, the liquefaction resistance decreases with an increase in cyclic shear stresses at a given initial confining pressure. Liquefaction resistance also decreases with an increase in confining pressure for any CSR values. Further, the effects of fly ash content on liquefaction resistance was found to depend upon the confining pressure. For all effective confining pressure, liquefaction resistance decreased with an addition of 10 % fly ash. However, when the fly ash content was increased to 20 %, the liquefaction resistance increased. Moreover, the liquefaction resistance of sand containing 20 % fly ash was higher than clean sand at 5 psi effective confining pressure. On the other hand, it was lower than clean sand for the effective confining pressure 10 and 15 psi. The brittleness of the sample was found to increase with an addition of fly ash. Youngs modulus and damping ratio were also determined. The Youngs modulus was found to decrease with an increase in axial strain for clean sand, and for sand containing 10 and 20 % fly ash. It was also noted that, Youngs modulus increases with an increase in confining pressure. The damping ratio increases with an increase in axial strain. No distinct variation of damping ratio with confining pressure was observed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>EFFECTS OF ADDITION OF LARGE PERCENTAGES OF FLY ASH ON LIQUEFACTION BEHAVIOR OF SAND.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Regmi, Gaurav</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The liquefaction resistance of a saturated medium sand with varying amount of non-plastic type F fly ash was evaluated by conducting cyclic triaxial tests. The test results were used to evaluate the effect of addition of various percentages of fly ash on the liquefaction resistance of Ottawa sand. The effect of cyclic shear stress and confining pressure on liquefaction resistance of the sand-fly ash mixtures was the main scope of this research. In addition, the Young&#39;s Modulus and Damping Ratio for sand-fly ash mixtures were also determined. A comprehensive experimental program was conducted in which 50 stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests were performed on a clean sand, sand containing 25%, 30%, 50% and 70% fly ash at a constant relative density of 50%. The results show that sand containing 25% fly ash has the highest liquefaction resistance under cyclic loading in comparison to clean sand and sand containing 30%, 50% and 70% fly ash. The cyclic resistance goes on decreasing as the fly ash content further increases. The test result also shows that the liquefaction resistance of the clean sand and sand containing 70% fly ii ash is almost same. The test results were also examined in terms of the conceptual framework of Thevanayagam (2000). The effects on liquefaction resistance were also measured in terms of pore water pressure generation and deformation of the sample. As the confining pressure increases, shear stress required to cause initial liquefaction of the sample also increases. Modulus of Elasticity was seen to increase with increase in confining pressure and decrease with increase in axial strain for all cases of sand-fly ash mixtures used in these tests. The damping ratio of the sample increases with the increase in axial strain upto about 1% and then it either decreases or remains constant thereafter. There was no clear correlation of damping ratio with confining pressure.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Ambulance Optimization Allocation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nasiri, Faranak</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Facility Location problem refers to placing facilities (mostly vehicles) in appropriate locations to yield the best coverage with respect to other important factors which are specific to the problem. For instance in a fire station some of the important factors are traffic time, distribution of stations, time of the service and so on. Furthermore, budget limitation, time constraints and the great importance of the operation, make the optimum allocation very complex. In the past few years, several research in this area have been done to help managers by designing some effective algorithm to allocating facilities in the best way possible. Most early proposed models were focused on static and deterministic methods. In static models, once a facility assigns to a location, it will not relocate anymore. Although these methods could be utilized in some simple settings, there are so many factors in real world that make a static model of limited application. The demands may change over time or facilities may be dropped or added. In these cases a more flexible model is desirable, thus dynamic models are proposed to be used in such cases. Facilities can be located and relocated based on the situations. More recently, dynamic models became more popular but there were still many aspects of facility allocation problems which were challenging and would require more complex solutions. The importance of facility location problem becomes significantly more relevant when it relates to hospitals and emergency responders. Even one second of improvement in response time is important in this area. For this reason, we selected ambulance facility allocation problem as a case study to analyze this problem domain. Much research has been done on ambulances allocation. We will review some of these models and their advantages and disadvantages. One of the best model in this areas introduced by Rajagopalan. In this work, his model is analyzed and its major drawback is addressed by applying some modifications to its methodology. Genetic Algorithm is utilized in this study as a heuristic method to solve the allocation model.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Influential Node Selection Using Positive Influential Dominating Set in Online Social Network</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Khan, Mahbubul Arefin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Online social networks (OSNs) have become a powerful medium of communicating, sharing and disseminating information. Because of popularity and availability of OSNs throughout the world, the connected users can spread information faster and thus propagate influence over each other constantly. Due to such impact, a lot of applications on OSNs focused on picking an initial set of users (seeds) to infuse their message in the OSN. Due to huge size of the network, the main challenge in picking the initial set is to maximize the resultant influence over the users in the network. The optimization problem of finding out the most influential set of members in an OSN for maximization of influence is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose using the Positive Influential Dominating Set (PIDS) algorithm for the initial seed. PIDS is a well-known algorithm which determines the influential backbone nodes in the networks. We implemented PIDS-based influence maximization by using different propagation models. We compared  PIDS performance to that of the existing approaches based on greedy and random heuristics. The experimental results from extensive simulation on real-world network data sets show that PIDS gives better influence spread than greedy and random for both Independent Cascade Model and Linear Threshold Model of influence propagation. PIDS is also scalable to large networks and in all size ranges, it performs well in influence maximization.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>CONTINUOUS LOCATION FINDING AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE WITH OBJECT DETECTION USING IMAGE PROCESSING AN ASPECT OF ROBOTIC VISION</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Talukder, Md Shapon Shapon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this thesis, I propose a method for finding the location of a moving robot in an arena. In scenarios where a robot need to reach a goal by evading obstacles or collision avoidance and perpetually calculating distance from the object, it is indispensable for the robot token precisely where it is. I propose an image processing with a color base approach to find the solution to this quandary. The main conception is to find some reference objects from the images captured by a camera and find a mapping between the size of the object in the image and the physical distance of the object. Amalgamating the distance information from multiple reference points I can facilely find the position of the robot in the arena. Experimental results reveal the prosperity of the proposed technique by engendering highly precise results.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>EFFECTS OF CHOICE AND NO CHOICE OF PREFERRED ENGAGMENT STIMULI TASKS ON THE OFF-TASK BEHAVIOR OF</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Schlenker-Korb, Rebecca Gail</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Problem behavior, such as off &#38;ndash - &#38;ndash task behavior, is one of the most commonly cited challenges competing with school readiness skills for young children with disabilities.  This study demonstrated how a functional behavior assessment can be conducted in a school setting to determine the functional relation between off &#38;ndash - &#38;ndash task behavior and academic engagement stimuli for three kindergarten students at &#38;ndash - &#38;ndash risk of academic failure. Indirect and descriptive behavior assessments were first conducted to determine the hypothesized function of off &#38;ndash - &#38;ndash task behavior.  Two experimental functional analysis conditions were then constructed to confirm the hypothesized function.   Results demonstrated that when preferred academic engagement stimuli were used during instruction, escape &#38;ndash - &#38;ndash maintained off &#38;ndash - &#38;ndash task behavior decreased substantially.  Therefore, the use of preferred stimuli as an instructional support may have abolished the value of escape as reinforcement for off &#38;ndash - &#38;ndash task behavior.  Implications for practice and future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Design of a database to compare genomes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pola, Naresh</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is one of the largest agricultural crops produced in the world. In recent years the consumption and the production of soybean have both increased. Consequently, the genomics industry has focused on this crop for intense study and analysis. The genome structures of different soybean plants can be better understood by representing their features in a genome database. SoyGD was a soybean genome database which represented the cultivars `Forrest&#39;, `Hartwig&#39;, `Essex&#39; and `Flyer&#39; genomic feature&#39;s in a user-friendly format. The database also provided mapping relationships between genomic features of soybean in general. The use of mapping with micro-satellite and single nucleotide polymorphism markers will provide critical advances in the analysis of crop traits. In this Dissertation SoyGD was modified to present a new Build5 for the Forrest physical map based on the genome sequence. A new set of 1,914 QTL (quantitative trait loci) and also a set of 4,815 new simple sequence repeat (SSRs) markers were added to this browser. Two sets of polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from different genome re-sequencing projects were shown. A set of 10,384 locatable minimum tiling path (MTP) clones were selected from 13,247 BAC clones. They were used to decorate the physical map based on sequence matches by the basic local alignment tool (BLAT). The mapping of QTL, SNPs and SSRs in Forrest and Hartwig are very important tools for breeders and are both economical and technically easy to use. To identify large insertions and deletions insert size distributions of BAC clones were calculated and the respective histogram, density, functions were plotted. Scripting techniques were used to screen the required data from millions of base pairs genomic data and arrange them in a Generic File Format (GFF) to represent in a Genome Database Browser (GBrowser).The study used scripting algorithms to get the minimum tiling path BAC clones and examine expected and observed insert sizes of clones to identify insertions and deletions. BACs were represented in a GBrowser and statistical language was used to plot the insert size distribution of BAC clones.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Ecient and Secure Transmission Method Using Data Partitioning for AMI in Smart Grids</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Watkins, Yijing Zhang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has been rapidly developed and widely used for the utility industry; meanwhile, it also has become an attractive target of different varieties of cyber-attacks due to AMI&#39;s security and privacy vulnerabilities as well as providing a way where one may steal energy. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a reliable, secure and efficient AMI network system with privacy protection. In this thesis, we introduce our data partitioning network system that splits the data into two separate partitions and transmits on one data channel with a privacy protection mechanism, an effective energy theft detection analyzer, a secure key exchange protocol, and a collaborative intrusion detection system in order to collect, transmit, manage, analyze and store energy information for the advanced metering infrastructure in smart grids. Security, privacy and energy theft are three main threats for AMI system.  Our proposed method allows the server to check the integrity without decrypting the message by using homomorphic encryption techniques. Additionally, our anomaly-based energy theft detection method detects energy theft using fuzzy clustering techniques from data mining which has a minimum accuracy of 95\%. A collaborative intrusion detection system that distributes various detection techniques with different levels of computation complexity into different parts of the AMI network communication system is discussed. With the help of an encryption key exchange protocol and the collaborative intrusion detection system, it is shown that a potential access point denial-of-service attack triggered by a single smart meter can occur and a possible solution to mitigate the attack is provided. Simulation and analytical results show that our AMI network system design can provide secure, private and efficient communication with reasonable delay and overheads.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Building Cultural and Linguistic Bridges: Interpersonal Relationships and the Brontë Sisters in German Translation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Farsi, Jasmin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Literary translation has become a part of our culture that we often do not recognize and rather take for granted. In fact, most readers of translated novels do not see or understand the complicated process that lies behind transferring someone else&#39;s work from its source language into the target language and culture. During this process, the translator faces linguistic and cultural obstacles that need to be overcome, and often require the translator to do extensive research on the novel&#39;s culture, time period, and the author&#39;s particular style. Interpersonal relationships between literary characters are arguably one of the most difficult aspects to translate, as they often contain a lot of nuance and expressions of strong emotions. With regards to the translators&#39; problem-recognition abilities and problem-solving techniques, this thesis examines the emotional conflict between literary characters in three novels by the Brontë sisters--Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall--with the attempt to identify the difficulties of the translation process and highlight particularly adept solutions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Constructed Boundaries: Reading Architecture in Marilynne Robinson&#39;s Housekeeping and Jeffrey Eugenides&#39;s The Virgin Suicides</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Munchow, Sarah</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis project analyzes the influence of the built environment on subjectivity in late twentieth-century American fiction.  Marilynne Robinson&#39;s Housekeeping, I contend, uses domestic architecture to inform the concept of female-as-subject, specifically through additive and subtractive construction techniques. These techniques influence public and private definitions of female, as they are present at the level of the individual house as well as the level of the town of Fingerbone as a cohesive unit.  Jeffrey Eugenides&#39;s The Virgin Suicides interrogates ethnic subjectivity in a suburban setting. A strict grid orders the suburban landscape which, although visually unifying a group of ethnically diverse individuals, ultimately isolates the subjects--down to the scale of the single-family home--as it encourages collective memory, ethnic repression, and the standardization of perspective. In these novels, architecture is an agent which negotiates subjectivity and the vehicle that communicates ideology through and with the material reality of these homes. Reading architecture helps us understand who these characters are and how the built environment shapes the way they have come to define themselves and others as individuals, which ultimately allows for the subversion of such definitions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Double Down at Last Call</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Bontrager, Joshua</dc:creator>
<dc:description>I came to SIU with poetic sensibilities and a sense of whimsy about writing from my undergraduate years.  In the interim period, I managed the volunteer construction of over 120 new homes in Hurricane Katrina ravaged Southeast Louisiana and the home repair of hundreds more for low-income families in the impoverished region of Appalachia.  I have stories.  I can swing a hammer and cut a board straight as a factory edge.   I wanted the same craft knowledge in poetry as I gained in home building.   I did not and still do not avidly read poetry.  Too often I feel poetry strives for obfuscation and devolves into literary claptrap.  I am interested in construction narratives that are comprehendible and meaningful.  When the professor I applied to SIU to work with (Rodney Jones) retired and was not replaced (the ol&#39; bait and no replace) I switched my focus to fiction and attempted to use this period of time in graduate school to obtain narrative skills to better express my experiences, memories, ideas, and humor in whatever format that may eventually take. 	During my first year in the M.F.A. program I began to refer to poems as &#34;word piles&#34; rather than assuming the ostentatious label of &#34;poetry.&#34;  I do not consider myself a poet, but rather a storyteller.  During my three years at this directional state school, I have almost unanimously chosen socialization over writing in solitary confinement.  During these social times, conversing and joking with my colleagues, I felt most inspired and motivated to create--characters, voices, histories, and stories.  I am still learning to appropriate this creative process to my writing and searching for what I truly enjoy engaging in as a writer and creator.   	In this thesis there is no overarching narrative.  Rather, the poems that follow represent various elements that interest me.  There are poems that deal with construction work, incidents from growing up, idea driven work, and pieces that deal with my experience living in and working with the people of Appalachia.  I am drawn to the anecdote and find in poetry I can mix the varied adventures and characters I have experienced with my imaginings in a manner that will reach people outside the genre.  All the poems that follow are meant to be read and accessible by people unfamiliar with the pretentious underpinnings of poetry and to cogently express the ideas and experiences I find to be engaging and meaningful.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Presence of High, Marginal, Low and Very Low Food Security among Illinois University Students</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Morris, Loran Mary</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Low and very low food security is a concern in the US, and specific populations are at high risk.  An understudied population with regards to food security is university students. University students suffering from low and very low food security are at risk for physical and mental consequences. Because limited research has been conducted identifying the food security status of university students in the US, the public is unaware of the problem.  This study was designed to determine food security status of Illinois university students and the socio-demographic characteristics associated with each food security classification. A cross-sectional survey design was used to analyze the food security status of Illinois university students.  An online 40-question survey based on the USDA&#39;s Household Food Security Survey Module was distributed via mass email to university students at four Illinois universities including Eastern Illinois University, Northern Illinois University, Southern Illinois University, and Western Illinois University.  Statistical analysis included frequencies and Chi-squared Test of Independence. A total sample of 2,753 students from four universities completed the online survey. Results determined that 30.4% of Illinois university students had low or very low food security, twice as high as the general public.  There were significant associations between food security status and the following socio-demographic variables: ethnicity, academic level, GPA, living location on- or off-campus, living alone, financial support, and hometown region.  African Americans and Hispanics, juniors and seniors, students with lower GPAs, students receiving financial support requiring repayment, and students from urban hometowns were found to be at-risk populations associated with low or very low food security. This study suggests a significant portion of Illinois university students are at high risk for low and very low food security.  Significant socio-demographic characteristics associated with low and very low food security could be used to develop programs targeting those in need.  Future research should be conducted to determine food security status of students at universities throughout the US</dc:description>

			<dc:title>THE IMPACT OF TASTE TEST INTERVENTIONS ON THE REDUCTION OF VEGETABLE PLATE WASTE IN A RURAL MIDDLE SCHOOL SETTING</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Romanowski, Emily</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF EMILY ROMANOWSKI, for the Master&#39;s of Science degree in FOOD AND NUTRITION, presented on NOVEMBER 25, 2013, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE:  THE IMPACT OF TASTE TEST INTERVENTIONS ON THE REDUCTION OF VEGETABLE PLATE WASTE IN A RURAL MIDDLE SCHOOL SETTING MAJOR PROFESSOR:  Dr. Sylvia Smith BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is on the rise in the United States and throughout the world. Studies have shown that reducing vegetable plate waste and increasing vegetable consumption in children can improve health outcomes. Studies have also suggested strategies to reduce the amount of plate waste that children produce during lunchtime.  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a nutrition education and taste test intervention would reduce plate waste of select vegetables in a middle school setting. DESIGN: The study used an experimental design. The study took place at an elementary school in the rural Midwest during the third and fourth quarters of the 2012-2013 school year. Plate waste measurements were originally taken for four specific vegetable items: zucchini and tomatoes, refried beans, mixed greens and black bean salsa. After the original measurements, students enrolled in a Family Consumer Sciences class during the third quarter participated in an intervention that involved nutrition education and tasting the specific vegetables. During the fourth quarter, plate waste measurements were taken again to determine if the nutrition education with taste tests helped to decrease the amount of plate waste produced by the students.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The independent variable being tested was participation in the taste tests with nutrition education intervention. The dependent variable being studied was the amount of vegetable based plate waste from Carbondale Middle School students.  STATISTIAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Independent t-tests were used to determine statistical differences in the amount of plate waste pre- and post-intervention. The survey given after the taste test was assessed using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to determine if one vegetable item was liked more than another. RESULTS: Results showed that the implemented nutrition intervention was not effective in reducing the amount of plate waste. There was a significant difference, however, in the opinions given by the students regarding the vegetables served (p=&#60;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are important in the implementation of new National School Lunch Program recommendations for vegetables and can provide insight on how to increase the amount of vegetables that students eat during school. This study can add to current research regarding plate waste, vegetable consumption, and strategies to increase healthful foods in children&#39;s diets.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Fruit and Vegetable Education with a School Garden on Kindergardeners&#39; Nutrition Knowledge</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Delvecchio, Afton Khale</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF AFTON KHALE DELVECCHIO, for the Master of Science Degree in Food and Nutrition, presented on November 15, 2013 a Southern Illinois University. TITLE: THE IMPACT OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EDUCATION WITH A SCHOOL GARDEN ON KINDERGARTENERS&#39; NUTRITION KNOWLEDGE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Sylvia Smith, CHE BACKGROUND: Over 12.5 million children and adolescents are obese in the United States (Nowak, Kolouch, Schneyer, &#38; Roberts, 2012). Only 7% of youth are currently consuming the recommended daily amounts of fruits and vegetables (Krebs-Smith &#38; Cook, 1996). Children are required to receive some sort of schooling, thus schools are utilized as a prime location in the United States for nutrition and health education. It has been found that exposure to and knowledge about food items, such as fruits and vegetables, results with increased intake (Ohri-Vachaspati, Turner, &#38; Chaloupka, 2012). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a nutrition education intervention with a school garden on kindergarten students&#39; attitude and knowledge about fruits and vegetables. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A five-week quasi-experimental study design was used. Three kindergarten classrooms from the same school participated in the study: a control, an education only, and an education with a garden. A total of 62 kindergarten students made up the convenience sample for this study. The study was conducted during April and May of 2013 at Parrish Elementary School in Carbondale, Illinois. The intervention classrooms experienced a half hour nutrition education intervention twice a week, for five weeks. The intervention lessons were based on the Fresh from the Farm curriculum, specifically for the first grade population. The classroom with the garden had an additional hour throughout the week to work and explore a growing garden. The students were given a Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire for baseline measurement and again after the five week intervention. The students&#39; attitude was measured using a three-point hedonic scale, while nutrition knowledge was measured using three separate matching exercises: fruits and vegetables to color, nutrients, and body parts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Independent Variables: Demographics, Nutrition Education Intervention. Dependent Variables: Attitudes to Fruits and Vegetables, Nutrition Knowledge. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Descriptive statistics were run to evaluate the study&#39;s sample. Chi-square test for cross tabulations was used to evaluate the attitude and knowledge of the kindergarten students. RESULTS: Kindergarten students in the garden classroom had a p-value of &#60;0.001 for the nutrient matching portion of the nutrition assessment. In addition, self-identified white students correctly matched nutrient to body part significantly better than self-identified black students, p&#60; 0.05. An association was found between the garden classroom and correctly matching nutrients, p&#60; 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Positive associations were found with students experiencing a school garden along with a nutrition a nutrition education intervention and their knowledge outcomes. The children in the garden classroom improved from pre-test to post-test, specifically with the nutrition matching portion of the nutrition knowledge. When compared with the education-only and control classrooms, the students in the garden classroom out-performed on the nutrient matching aspect of nutrition knowledge.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Tools Tested for Outdoor Recreation, Environmental Education and Stewardship: Allowing Children to Make the Rules</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Baird, Laura Eaton</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Engaging children in natural settings enhances learning and promotes development while utilizing protected natural areas. However, many schoolchildren, especially from economically disadvantaged areas, lack support for environmental education (EE) to develop skills and attitudes to increase rates of appropriate, resource-protective behaviors. This causes resource degradation wherever children visit protected natural areas. Improved EE should reduce the amount of resource degradation when children visit natural settings. This project proposes a model program of replicable, low–cost, widely accessible critical thinking activities and materials designed to directly address this problem. The Girl Scouts of Southern Illinois, Camp Ondessonk, and Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge were partners in this project. The objectives were to create, test, evaluate, and disseminate tools for teachers in the form of a pre–visit program with three specific engagement methods to engage children in activities that cultivate critical thinking and encourage resource–appropriate behaviors. Original activities involving a discussion–based journal, handmade wristband, and interactive games were conducted during small–group interactive workshops at Camp Cedar Point in Makanda, Illinois and Camp Ondessonk in Ozark, Illinois (n=225). Pre/post program evaluations were administered, and camper behavior on a hike was observed. It was hypothesized that campers would shift towards a more pro–environmental attitude and exhibit lower rates of depreciative behaviors after any combination of activities than the control group of campers, and that a combination of all three methods of engagement would be the most effective approach in reducing depreciative behavior and changing attitudes towards resource protection, by addressing multiple motivations. The most effective combination of activities in changing attitudes was found to be the journal and games (p&#60;0.01), although all combinations of the program activities resulted in attitude scores that were higher than the initial score (p&#60;0.01). There was no significant change in behavior between treatments or between the control group and treatments. Possible causes and other considerations are discussed, including recommendations for future research on the effect of adult behavior modeling, reminders, and factors such as weather, gender, and group size on the depreciative rates of children. The activities will be combined into a PDF packet for distribution to teachers by land managers and environmental educators in the area.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>EFFECTS OF THE INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES AUTUMN OLIVE (ELAEAGNUS UMBELLATA) ON SMALL MAMMAL POPULATIONS IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hayes, Stephanie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Invasive plant species have widespread effects on the ecosystems they inhabit. Extensive research has been done on the economic and ecological impact of invasive species in relation to native plant species, but little is known about the effect of these species on native fauna. My study examined the impact of an invasive plant species Elaeagnus umbellata (autumn olive) on small mammals populations in southern Illinois. Elaeagnus umbellata is a native shrub of southeast Asia and was introduced to the United States in the 1830s. It is now the fifth most abundant invasive plant species in the state of Illinois. To determine the impact of this invasive shrub on small mammal populations, Sherman traps were set up in six separate trapping webs, three in upland forests with heavy E. umbellata cover and three in upland forests with little to no E. umbellata cover (control). Trapping spanned three seasons from March-August 2013. Through the use of capture and release methods, individuals were measured, weighed, and marked for possible recapture. Beginning in season 3, Cuterebra fontinella (bot fly) abundance in small mammals was also assessed. Differences in relative abundance of small mammal populations were determined using a repeated measures ANOVA with a Tukey test. T-tests were used to determine any significant difference among small mammals between forest types. Very little difference was found among the measured variables between the invaded and control forest sites. Prevalance of C. fontinella was also similar, but the resulting percentage of infection was much higher when compared to other studies in the literature. These results indicate there is little effect of E. umbellata on small mammal populations, although the long-term impacts of this invasive species may need further research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Three Dimensional Modeling of mantle melt underneath Lau&#39;s Back-Arc spreading center and Tofua Volcanic Arc</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tarlow, Scott</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Valu Fa and Eastern Lau `s (two regions along Lau&#39;s back-arc spreading center) observed axial morphology suggest that Valu Fa is more magmatically robust than Eastern Lau despite Eastern Lau&#39;s spreading rate nearly doubling Valu Fa&#39;s.  Early geochemical [Pearce et al., 1994] and geophysical [Martinez and Taylor, 2002] studies predict a gradational decrease in melting moving north from Valu Fa to Eastern Lau, but more recent geochemical and seismic observations ([Escrig, .et al 2009]; [Dunn and Martinez, 2011]; [Dunn et al., 2011]) show a sharper stepwise decrease in melting as the spreading center&#39;s ridge axis sweeps away from the Tofua Volcanic-Arc.  As the ridge sweeps away from the volcanic-arc, the influence of the slab hydrated mantle in the melting structure of the ridge decreases. Furthermore, Eastern Lau produces a thinner crust than expected for a robust spreading center.  2-D numerical studies [Harmon and Blackmon, 2010] show a gradational decrease in melting from Valu Fa to Eastern Lau but with no corresponding thinning of Eastern Lau&#39;s crust.   To understand the melting dynamics underneath Lau&#39;s back-arc spreading center and the Tofua Volcanic-Arc implementing the effects of 3-D mantle flow and slab hydration appears to be required. To explain the observed geochemical and seismic observations, three 3-D numerical were performed, using a community developed mantle convection solver (CitcomS).  The first model shows that observed geometric and surface kinematic boundary conditions    cause a steep gradational increase in relative melting area (anhydrous) moving northward with increasing spreading rate along the ridge axis from Valu Fa to Eastern Lau caused by a northwestern along axis mantle flow.  A peak in the relative melting area appears particularly close to Eastern Lau where crust is thinnest. These predictions run in opposition to the observations. The second model shows including a viscosity reduction in the mantle wedge due to slab hydration causes a more subdued relative melting increase with spreading rate and &#34;saddle&#34; shaped decrease in relative melting area north of 20.9°S.  This saddle shaped melting structure is caused by a reversal in along axis flow towards the southeast, which takes hot mantle from Eastern Lau and transports it underneath Valu Fa accounting for the anomalously thin crust observed at Eastern Lau.  Finally, introducing a hydrated solidus increases the melt production under Valu Fau and causes a stepwise decrease in melt production at Eastern Lau due to its decreased proximity to the slab-hydrated region, consistent with the observed geochemical and seismic studies.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Partial Melting Experiments on an Mg # 80 Martian Mantle and Their Implications for Basalt Genesis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chartrand, Zachary Adam</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dreibus and Wänke (1985) calculated a bulk composition for the interior of Mars (DW model) based on eight Martian meteorites.  Since then, experiments on the Martian interior have used this model, or similar models, to understand processes that may influence basalt genesis within the Martian mantle.  Recent experiments have shown that the DW model does not fit with the current, now greater number of Martian meteorites (132 including paired stones as of April 2014) and surface basalt compositions.  One of the parameters that does not match is the Mg # (atomic [Mg2+/(Mg2+ + Fe2+)]*100); the current data show that Mars is not as iron rich as once thought and needs a higher bulk Mg # for the mantle to produce Martian basaltic compositions.  This project involves experiments using a new bulk composition with an Mg # of 80 to update the compositions of a partially melted Martian mantle.  A melt produced by this new bulk composition consists of MgO and FeO levels that match well with the primitive Martian meteorite Yamato-980459.  Additionally, this composition was produced with 37% melt.  Melts produced with this bulk composition match poorly with Na2O composition of Martian meteorites and match better, but still not particularly well, with CaO and Al2O3 compositions.  However, lower-temperature partial melts of the Mg # 80 mantle match well with CaO, Al2O3, FeO, and Na2O compositions of Martian surface basalts.  This shows that the source of the surface basalts is represented well by the model in this study.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Cataclastic flow kinematics inferred from magnetic fabrics at the Heart Mountain detachment, Wyoming</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Heij, Gerhard</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The Heart Mountain Detachment (HMD) in Wyoming constitutes one of the largest known rock slides (3400 km2) on Earth. This detachment took place along the stratigraphic boundary between the Bighorn Dolomite at the hanging-wall and the Snowy Range Formation at the footwall. The slide resulted in the formation of an up to 3 m-thick carbonate ultracataclasite (CUC) at the base of the slide. The origin of the CUC and the nature of the triggering mechanism responsible for the initiation of the catastrophic movement have long been controversial. The most widely accepted theory is a mid-Eocene eruption in the Absaroka volcanic province that triggered rupture and subsequent detachment of Paleozoic rocks. Rapid sliding was facilitated by basal fluidization generated by thermo-mechanical decomposition of carbonate rocks. Here I present a proof of concept study addressing the question of the consistent magnetic fabrics observed in the CUC, as well as new observations indicating the discovery of mineral grains of volcanic origin within the CUC. Additionally, some constraints are placed on the thermo-chemical conditions operating at the base of this catastrophic landslide. Overall, the CUC displays an average magnetic susceptibility one order of magnitude higher (1803 . -6 [SI]) than the overlying Bighorn Dolomite (148 . -6 [SI]) and underlying Snowy Range Fm (636 . -6 [SI]). Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) data, field observations and microstructural analysis suggest that ferromagnetic (s.l) minerals  in the CUC originate from the Bighorn Dolomite, the Tertiary volcanics and synkinematic thermal decomposition of pyrite into pyrrhotite and magnetite. Thermomagnetic investigations revealed a Curie temperature of 525 °C which suggests that magnetite is the dominant magnetic carrier mineral in the CUC.  Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analyses confirm that this magnetite has a relatively low ulvöspinel content. Magnetic hysteresis properties point to an average pseudo-single domain magnetic grain size or, alternatively, a mixture of single domain and multi-domain grains. The origin of AMS is magnetostatic, elucidated by a high degree of consistency between AMS directions and 3–D SPO directions. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) directional data displays two dominant fabric orientations suggesting possible strain partitioning in the CUC. The consistency of magnetic fabrics suggests that the CUC followed a dominantly transpressive regime. The deformation mechanism causing the consistent AMS is a homogeneous passive rotation of magnetite grains. Microstructural analysis of iron bearing minerals suggests that a high oxygen fugacity was present in the CUC at the onset of the slide. Evidence for elevated temperatures in the CUC is shown by broken twins in calcite which form as result of dynamic recrystallization. High pore fluid in the CUC is indicated by CUC dikes intruding the hanging wall and by accretionary grains (lapilli). Finally, the presence of unserpentinized and a few weakly serpentinized   olivine clasts in the CUC brings the &#34;hot water&#34; weakening mechanism proposed by Ahranov and Anders (2006) into question.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>KNOWLEDGE AND HEALTH BELIEFS ABOUT TYPE II DIABETES AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS USING HEALTH BELIEF MODEL</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Merzah, Mohammed</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background: Type II diabetes, which is known as non-insulin dependent diabetes, has become an epidemic worldwide. In the United States, diabetes affects 25.8 million people which represent 8.3% of the population. Out of 25.8 million, 23.22 million people have Type II diabetes. According to the National Statistics Vital Report, Type II diabetes was the number seven cause of death in the USA and it can be prevented. The primary purpose of this study was to assess the overall knowledge and health beliefs about Type II diabetes among a sample of undergraduate students; the second purpose was to assess the relationship between the overall knowledge and health belief subscale.  	Methods: A cross-sectional and descriptive survey design was used. An existing knowledge and health belief instruments was adapted. In the 2014 spring semester, a non- random convenience sample of over 200 undergraduate students who enrolled in Foundation of Human Health 101- class were surveyed in order to assess knowledge and health belief about Type II diabetes. The Health Belief Model provided the theoretical framework for this study.     	Results: Overview of the participants in this study was provided through conducting a descriptive analysis. Majority of the participant were female, aged between eighteen and twenty, and Caucasian. Data analysis revealed that the overall knowledge about Type II diabetes among participants was low. For the individual health beliefs, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and perceived barriers to Type II diabetes were low; however, perceived benefits to engaging in healthy behaviors was high.  	Having other problems more important than worrying about diet and exercise, and not knowing the appropriate exercise to perform to reduce the risk of developing Type II diabetes were the major barriers among participants. A positive, weak, statistically significant correlation was found between overall knowledge and total belief of benefits to engaging in healthy actions. At the same time, a negative, weak, statistically significant correlation was found between overall knowledge and total belief of barriers to engaging in health lifestyles. Results from multiple regression revealed that knowledge was best predicted by race/ethnicity. Family history, stress level, and level of exercise were the best predictors of perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, respectively. Perceived severity was not predicted by any of the independent variables.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The 1950s saw the height of the Beat literature movement.  Within this movement moved a cohort of women who helped revolutionize gender relations in the early Cold War era, leading to the emergence of the women&#39;s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  By questioning social gender norms and harnessing their artistic, sexual, and economic autonomy, Beat women built lives of lived art outside proscribed social norms building the base for a new era in gender relations.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Personification and Masculation of Samuel Henry Dalton</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tow, Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:description>American historiography no longer discusses the over eighteen thousand African-American sailors of the Union Navy as property, percentages, or political conundrums, as previous scholarship had.  Advancements in social history made by historians David Valuska and Joseph Reidy in the 1990s led to the realization that these were men with incredible stories.  This realization led to the discovery of Samuel Henry Dalton as well as many truths about the society that shaped him and the one in which he achieved manhood. Isaac Noble immigrated to Jefferson County, Mississippi, in 1804 to begin his ascension into the planter elite that would help shape the economy and social structure of Mississippi for many generations.  While in the Natchez District of southwest Mississippi, Noble experienced three boom-and-bust cycles of cotton capitalism, with the period from 1811 to 1817 being the most profitable in Mississippi history.  Noble also experienced immense anxiety as Jefferson County&#39;s enslaved population of near sixty-nine percent spawned paranoia of a biracial insurrection orchestrated by white transients thought to be of a lax moral character.  This paranoia and resultant vigilanteism motivated Isaac Noble to move his family to an abolitionist settlement in Jersey County, Illinois, in 1836. In 1849, Aaron, the youngest of Isaac Noble&#39;s children, purchased over twenty-one hundred acres in Bolivar County, Mississippi, and named it the Egypt Place.  By the mid-1850s, Aaron was living on the Egypt Place and cotton was selling for only a third of the price it brought during the days that Isaac Noble was in southwest Mississippi.  The sheer volume of the harvests in Bolivar County and the rest of the Choctaw Session, however, still yielded profits and inclined planters to bring more land into cultivation and more slaves to work the land.  It was during this last phase of expansion that Samuel Dalton was brought to the Egypt Place as the United States became more politically and socially embroiled over slavery. The eruption of the Civil War in 1861 put immense pressure on the planter elite to ensure the endurance of the social structure they had so tirelessly built.  As the war got ever closer to Mississippi, that pressure pressed ever harder on Vicksburg, the long-defiant fortress keeping the Mississippi River in Confederate hands.  The Confederacy could not survive if Vicksburg surrendered, which it did in July 1863.  The fall of Vicksburg presented a windfall of opportunity for Dalton and the more than three hundred thousand other enslaved of Mississippi as the planter elite scrambled to save what wealth and property they could carry off as the Union Army quickly approached.  Life would never again be the same for the planter elite nor the enslaved. With the overseer having fled and there no longer being any means to enforce the oppression that was the social structure of western Mississippi, Samuel Dalton chose a very active path to freedom by fleeing the Egypt Place and enlisting in the Union Navy the day after Vicksburg&#39;s fall.  For fifteen months, from July 1863 through October 1864, Dalton served aboard two gunboats of the Mississippi Squadron.  His time aboard the USS Juliet was very dull, while his service aboard the USS Hastings was extremely dangerous given the latter ship&#39;s involvement in the ill-advised and ill-executed Red River Campaign into central Louisiana.  The twice promoted and twice shackled Dalton survived the expedition and was honorably discharged at Cairo, Illinois. After discharge, Samuel Dalton remained in southern Illinois in defiance of the rarely enforced Black Laws of 1853, which made African-American residency in the state punishable by fine or imprisonment.  It was in southern Illinois, a region ironically called Egypt, that Dalton achieved the manhood so desired by the freedmen, as explained by historian Donald Schaffer.  In the fifty years Dalton lived in Carbondale and Murphysboro, he became a property owner, husband, father, active member of the Grand Army of the Republic, and lived peacefully in an integrated neighborhood with the respect of his white neighbors before his death on 7 June 1920.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Urban Messenger: The Growth of the St. Louis Public Library, 1870-1930</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nichols, Matthew Alexander</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Abstract Between the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, drastic changes were made to the structure, organization, and purpose of libraries throughout the United States. The St. Louis Public Library was no exception, beginning as a public school library during the 1860s. Between 1870 and 1930, the foundations were established for the St. Louis Public Library to become a modern American library through the efforts of administrators such as Frederick Crunden, Arthur Bostwick, and Effie Power, among others. This project seeks to examine the St. Louis Public Library as a case study of library development across the United States, and how it, as a Progressive institution, sought to inculcate a love of readership and education and therefore democratize the availability of books and other materials for the advancement of all.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>IMPROVING ONLINE COURSE SATISFACTION AND DELIVERY THROUGH QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT</dc:title>
<dc:creator>ALBALAWI, JALAL G.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study investigated student perceptions of online courses offered by SIU&#39;s Quality Engineering and Management online program. The study utilized the method for measuring and improving the quality of online courses using the quality function deployment (QFD) approach. This method was used to translate critical quality requirements for online course delivery, determined by student survey responses, into key instructional design/delivery elements that serve as a framework for online course development. This study focused on students&#39; satisfaction and perception because of their role in analyzing the design/delivery elements based on quality function approach. In order to improve the online Quality Engineering and Management online program, the students&#39; engagement will apply the most important key to successful improvement.  In this study, both qualitative and quantitative methodologies were employed. The data was retrieved through an on-line survey. A written questionnaire was completed by 17 online graduate students in the Quality Engineering and Management program. The research results identified the most important technical requirements in online course design and delivery, and identified opportunities for improvement.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PASSED DOWN: MASCULINE FAMILIAL RELATIONS IN FILM</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kartje, Michael J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My short narrative film Passed Down follows three generations of men in a family: a son, a father and a grandfather. Composed of four short scenes, the film focuses on the three characters as they work through issues of masculinity, passed down from one generation to the next. My film suggests that this cultural sharing is part of a much larger set of social boundaries that help define what it is to &#34;be a man&#34;. These scenes reflect my own personal experience with this phenomenon, as a son and as a father myself.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Oxide Incident</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nylen, Nick</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My interest in sound-centric filmmaking and the literary genre of magical realism fostered the development of my thesis film, The Oxide Incident. The film is the story of Simon, a recent divorcee and sound archivist, who discovers a mysterious reel-to-reel-audio tape that he believes may help him heal his damaged relationship with Hannah, his teenage daughter. This paper examines the influence of magical realism on the film, some of its thematic, theoretical, and conceptual ideas such as its exploration of interpersonal communication and its implications in regard to gender, as well as some of its formal strategies. It concludes with a reflection on the process, a historical note, and a glimpse at my future trajectory as a filmmaker.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>In Memory of Grandmother</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Aboshi, Tetsuya</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In Memory of Grandmother is a 3D CGI narrative animation film which is a semi-fictional account of my grandmother&#39;s life. Through this piece I was able to portray the honor and respect the way my grandmother lived as well as being able to show the way of Japanese Samurai and I could acknowledge my identity as a descendant of Samurai, such that the ancestral blood runs in my veins metaphorically and in reality. This work adds to the body of research on exploring traditional Japanese culture in juxtaposition to the socio-economic changes Japan is currently going through. It is story of a woman&#39;s life who lived during the Samurai era, showing her glory amidst the increasing sacrifice and pain of being tossed about by the family she married into as a young woman.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Theta Methods For Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations and Error Analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Walker, Matthew Thomas</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Matthew Walker, for the Master of Science degree in Mathematics, presented on July 3, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: THETA METHODS OF NONLINEAR ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND ERROR ANALYSIS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. H. Schurz This paper will discuss how Theta Methods applied to a Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation behave for different critical values of theta. We will look at the stability, consistency, and convergence of the Forward Euler Method, Backward Euler Method, Trapezoidal Method, and the Midpoint Method. All of which can be derived from the Theta Method. After we discuss the convergence we will construct error surfaces and discuss which is the best derived method based on these created surfaces.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>GEOMETRY OF LEGENDRE TRANSFORM AND APPLICATIONS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>RUPASSARA, RUPASSARAGE UPUL HEMAKUMARA</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This thesis explores the algebraic and geometric structure of the Legendre transform and its application in various field of mathematics and physics. Specifically linear transformation as a mathematical process and motivating it in terms related to phenomena in mathematics and physics. The Legendre transform provides a change of variables to express equations of the motion or other physical relationships in terms of most convenient dynamical quantities for a given experiment or theoretical analysis. In classical mechanics the Legendre transform generates the Hamiltonian function of a system from the Lagrangian function or vice versa. In thermodynamics the Legendre transform allows thermodynamic relationships to be written in terms of alternative sets of independent variables. Here we review the properties of Legendre transform and why it is so important in mathematics and physics.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Automated Ultrasonic Signal Classification of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic Laminates</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sameeuddin, Sameeuddin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Carbon composites, particularly carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) are increasingly being used in many commercial applications such as automobile, aerospace, and civil infrastructures. This increase in the demand of CFRPs has led the manufacturers to research for ways of early detection and classification of defects in CFRP. This thesis work discusses the implementation of a Hopfield neural network (HNN) to automatically detect and classify defects in CFRP by ultrasonic testing (UT). Three of the most common and critical defects found in CFRP, i.e. foreign object (FO) inclusion, impact damage (ID), and porosity, were the main focus of this research. These defects were engineered into three different CFRP panels during manufacturing and were provided by an outside supplier. These panels were inspected on a standard immersion ultrasonic testing system in pulse-echo mode. One hundred time-amplitude based ultrasonic A-scan signals were recorded from the defected areas of each of the panels. Additionally, a hundred ultrasonic A-scan signals were recorded for the defect-free region of the CFRP. Signal preprocessing in terms of signal alignment is a vital process in any classification procedure as unaligned signals are prone to bad classification accuracies. Therefore, the raw A-scan signals were start-point aligned prior to any classification using cross-correlation technique. This research also focused on developing a feature extraction technique that could be used in conjunction with the HNN to classify the UT signals with high classification accuracy. A feature extraction technique based on gating technique was developed which consisted of five features, namely mean value of the signal, standard deviation of the signal, peak-to-peak amplitude value of the front wall echo (FEW), peak-to-peak amplitude value of the back wall echo (BWE), and time of flight (TOF) between FWE and BWE of each signal. Four other feature extraction techniques based on mean value of the signal, standard deviation value of the signal, fast Fourier transform (FFT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were also used for the comparison and validation of results obtained by the developed feature extraction technique. The 100 signals for each category were randomly partitioned into equal-sized training and testing data sets. The partitioning was repeated for 1000 iterations, to average the results and obtain a robust estimate of the classification performance. The classification of the signals was carried out by implementing two approaches. The first approach utilized a dichotomous classification between each defect type and the non-defected region. And the second approach utilized a 4-class classification in which the defect types and the non-defected signals were classified at the same time. The results of this research showed that the classification accuracies for the 2-class problem obtained through the developed feature extraction technique exceeded 99%, which were in agreement with the results of classification obtained through the four conventional feature extraction techniques. The results of the 4-class problem obtained through the developed feature extraction technique exceeded 96% classification accuracy. For direct comparison, the results obtained from the four conventional feature extraction techniques exceeded 99% classification accuracies. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the developed feature extraction technique can be used in conjunction with HNN to successfully classify defects in CFRP. With few modifications, the developed technique can be implemented to classify other types of defects in CFRP and can be implemented in different applications.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Amin Bagheri, for the Master of Science degree in MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND ENERGY PROCESSES, presented on June 23, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale TITLE:	STUDYING THE MAGNETIC SEPARATION OF OXYGEN CARRIER IN COAL DIRECT CHEMICAL LOOPING MAJOR PROFESSOR:	Dr. Tomasz S. Wiltowski Magnetic separation of oxygen carrier from coal after combustion by-products was studied. Samples were prepared using iron metal, hematite and magnetite mixed with quartz in three different concentrations. A variable speed and magnetic field intensity separator unit was designed and constructed to prove the concept of magnetic separation. The unit went through trial and error steps to improve overall functionality and efficiency including belt material selection, electromagnet selection, feeder and collector buckets, drive drum and idler manufacturing. Prepared samples were tested in different velocities and magnetic field intensities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Performance of Vacuum Insulation Panels in Building Energy Consumption</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Herek, Steven</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Insulation is a key aspect of the energy consumption of a building.  Determining the best type of insulation to implement in a building can be difficult, especially with new technologies emerging.  This paper summarizes a study of one emerging type of insulation, Vacuum Insulation Panels, and explores the applicability of Vacuum Insulation Panels as building insulation.  Building energy simulations were performed using EnergyPlus (Department of Energy simulation and energy analysis program).  Simulations were done to compare the absence of insulation to the use of traditional building insulation and to the use of Vacuum Insulation Panels in relevant areas of a building.  The simulations showed that in moderate to cold climates Vacuum Insulation Panels can account for an overall building energy savings of up to 10%.  In warmer months, especially in warmer climates, the savings are insignificant.  In hot climates the study showed no savings.  For winter months in colder climates savings are at least 10% and reach as high as 16%.  VIPs certainly have the potential to save energy in moderate to cold climates, especially during the coldest months of the year.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Design and Characterization of a Compact Heat Exchanger for use  with Nanofluids</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Grohmann, Daniel Ray</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Daniel Grohmann, for the Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering on May 5, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A COMPACT HEAT EXCHANGER FOR USE WITH NANOFLUIDS Major Professor: Dr. Kanchan Mondal This research is aimed to design and characterize an experimental plain channel, plate heat exchanger and further compare the performance of water based nanofluids as with that of water. The thesis discusses the designing and fabrication of the heat exchanger such that several parameters such as temperature, flow rate, nanoparticle concentration, and length of channels can be varied.  Three sizes of heat exchangers were fabricated.  Experiments were conducted to remove heat from air at different temperatures by the various heat exchanger fluids, namely water, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 vol.% alumina in water. Flow rates of the cold fluid were varied in order to change the Reynolds Number while maintaining a laminar regime. In the experiments with water as the heat exchanger fluid, it was found that the heat exchange did not follow pure counter current flow conditions presumably due to end effects.  A correction factor, F, for the log mean temperature difference value was calculated for each case to estimate the mean temperature difference.  The effectiveness values were found to be greater than 0.75 for most cases.  It was also found that the thermal entrance length was larger than the length of the channels for the shortest heat exchanger.  In addition, it was observed that the laminar regime Nusselt number values were similar to values reported in literature for flow through mini and micro channels.  Convective heat transfer coefficients were calculated and were found to be of the order of those reported for water. It was also discovered that Prandtl number was the most influential property for this study. As opposed to expectations, the use of nanofluids was found that it did not significantly improve heat transfer than that of the water alone.  The only case that the nanofluids had a significant enhancement in the performance was that of the 6in plate at 1 vol.% of 11% increase. The rest of the study showed that it had no increase or negative effects.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>COMPARISON OF NICKEL AND IRON-BASED OXYGEN CARRIERS SUPPORTED ON ALUMINA IN  SYNGAS-FUELED CHEMICAL LOOPING COMBUSTION</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Najjarpour Jabbary, Farzin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Chemical looping is considered as a novel technology capable of resolving both energy and environmental problems in combustion process. The possibility of using oxides of nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) as oxygen carriers was investigated. Solid oxygen carriers were prepared by  deposition of metal oxides on γ-Alumina (Al2O3) particles by incipient wet impregnation method. The reactivity of metal oxides was examined in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), where they were exposed to syngas (34% CO, 66% H2) and steam for reduction, and to air (79% N2, 21% O2) for oxidation at temperature ranging from 700°C to 900°C. Fe and Ni particles showed high reactivity at high temperatures with reduction rate of 95%/min and 85%/min, respectively. Oxidation rate for both metal oxides were 100%/min. Furthermore, nickel oxide showed promising potential to be used under cyclic conditions since it showed high strength under multiple cycles while Fe particles show sign of agglomeration which affect their reactivity during multiple cycles.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>IMPROVING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF A MID-SIZE POWER PLANT BY REDUCTION IN AUXILIARY POWER AND IMPROVED HEAT TRANSFER</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Green, Jeffrey Andrew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study incorporates the potential use of Variable Frequency Drives on various motors as well as areas of improved heat transfer in an older, mid-sized coal fired power plant.  In power plants, fluid flow rates are often controlled using dampers or valves while the motors that power the pumps stay at full speed resulting in a significant amount of wasted electrical power; energy is also lost due to poor heat recovery prior to gases leaving the system.  By examining pump usage as well as additional heat available for recovery, potential energy savings will be determined.   	Preliminary results of five motors suggested for variable frequency drive application show annual savings that total 31.1 GWh, resulting in a 1.66% increase in overall plant efficiency.  Total project costs are near $2 million resulting in a simple payback period of less than two years assuming 0.04 $/kWh.  For every degree reduction of the flue gas temperature by means of heat recovery that is reused elsewhere in the cycle, 2 Billion BTU of coal would be saved annually.  One realistic scenario suggested heat recovery resulting in a 120°F degree reduction of flue gas temperature amounting to a 2.54% increase in cycle efficiency.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>NFÎºB REGULATION OF PLACENTA GROWTH FACTOR AND ITS PRIMARY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, GLIAL CELL MISSING 1</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Murphy, Timothy</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Preeclampsia is one of the most common complications of human pregnancy.  Though its pathophysiology is not fully understood, it is thought that shallow migration of cytotrophoblast and the subsequent insufficient conversion of the maternal spiral arteries into utero-placental arteries play important roles.  As fetal demands for oxygen and nutrients increase during gestation, this aberrant remodeling of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface results in a relatively hypoxic and nutrient-deficient placenta bed.  Hypoxia is known to decrease placenta growth factor (PGF) expression in trophoblast and may play a key role in the suppression of PGF levels associated with preeclampsia.  Systemic vasodilation, also critical to facilitate a healthy pregnancy, is significantly correlated with higher serum levels of PGF.  Dysregulation of certain pro-inflammatory pathways, including NFκB, has also been implicated in preeclampsia development.  The goal of our studies was to determine the mechanism governing NFκB regulation of PGF in trophoblast.  Over-expression of NFκBp65, an active subunit of the NFκB complex, significantly decreases PGF mRNA expression in trophoblast - an effect which is ablated by co-expression of a dominant negative (dn) IκB which inhibits NFκB complex activity.  Similarly, over-expression of NFκBp65 functionally inhibits glial cell missing 1 (GCM1), the primary transcription factor of PGF in trophoblast.  Previous reports show that GCM1 protein is degraded during hypoxia.  Because hypoxia and activation of NFκB have similar effects on both PGF and its transcription factor, GCM1, we have investigated the possibility of cross-talk between these two pathways.  Over-expression of NFκBp65 was able to inhibit GCM1 protein stability and expression, but transient transfection with dnIκB was unable to prevent hypoxia-induced inhibition of PGF reporter activity.  Collectively, these results indicate that hypoxia and NFκB activation utilize independent pathways to decrease PGF expression in trophoblast.  To facilitate future investigation of these pathways, we have also established a novel stable cell line which can be used to induce high levels of NFκBp65 expression in a controllable manner, and observe its effects without the need for co-transfection.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Capsule Thermoregulation and Non-Coding RNA in Streptococcus pyogenes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wright, Jordan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Streptococcus pyogenes is a re-emerging pathogen that produces superficial and life threatening invasive diseases.  One important virulence factor in S. pyogenes is hyaluronic acid capsule which has been shown to increase expression at sub-body temperatures in certain strains.  This study showed that thermoregulation is common in invasive clinical isolates.  Regulation was shown to occur independent of the CovRS two-component regulator in a post transcription manner and before protein level regulation.  The endoribonuclease, CvfA, was also confirmed to be required for capsule thermoregulation.  The search for a regulator lead to the discovery of the 1st antisense RNAs in S. pyogenes found opposite the capsule synthesis genes.  Its role if any in capsule has not been discovered.  Finally, a group of sRNAs were characterized adding to the knowledge of this layer of regulation in S. pyogenes.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES OF TARGETING THE THROMBOXANE A2 RECEPTOR IN CANCER.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Allaj, Viola</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is an eicosanoid formed by the action of thromboxane A2 synthase (TXS) utilizing the cyclooxygenase product, prostaglandin H2, as the substrate. This prostanoid acts mainly by binding to its cognate thromboxane receptor (TP), a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs convey the majority of signal transduction across cell membranes. They are heptahelical serpentine receptors with many clinical implications. Aberrant expression or deregulated activity of GPCRs contributes to some of the most prevalent human diseases. TP activation can cause platelet activation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and mitogenesis. A single copy of the TP gives rise to TPα and TPβ isoforms, which share the first 328 amino acids but differ at the carboxy-terminal domains. Previous studies in our lab have shown that the TXA2-TPβ signaling axis pathway regulates tumor cell cytoskeleton by inducing cell contraction during migration. The cytoskeleton reorganization observed was mediated through small RhoA GTPase activation. Metastasis is the major cause of death from cancer and acquisition of motility by cancer cells is a detrimental component in metastasis. Therefore, it is important to identify a natural TP antagonist that will serve as a therapeutic regimen for cancer by inhibiting the TPβ induced cell contraction. Our work has shown that SIU1315, a phytoestrogen, blocks cell contraction induced by the TP agonist U46619. The SIU1315 inhibitory concentration (IC50) of U46619 induced contraction was determined to be 10 uM and treatment with the compound alleviated RhoA activation. Moreover, SIU1315 reduces the migratory capacity and invasiveness of PC3 cells. Utilization of the compound to inhibit TP-mediated tumor cell motility and metastatic progression in an in vivo model of experimental metastasis had an unexpected outcome. Administration of SIU1315 in female SCID mice, that received tumor cells via tail vein injection, did not prevent the metastatic spread of malignant cells. On the contrary, mice that had been treated with SIU1315 were indicative of a higher number of metastatic lung lesions than the non-treated control group. Similar evidence was observed by luciferase readouts in other organs. It is suspected that SIU1315 stimulates the vasodilatory nitric oxide that further interferes with the metastatic process. SIU1315 could be used as an anti-metastatic agent in combination with compounds that would suppress activation of nitric oxide. Furthermore, the quest for TPβ specific antibodies, that would have the potential to distinguish between thromboxane receptor isoforms, led to investigation of a number of purified antibodies. Validation of TPβ specific antibodies demonstrated that none of the examined antibodies was specific for TPβ. Determination of the specific TPβ domain that is responsible for U46619 induced cell contraction proved rather difficult. Generation and utilization of TPβ mutants requires additional optimization studies. The function of TP receptors in lung cancer has not been extensively studied. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high levels of TP expression had significantly shorter disease free survival than patients with low TP expression.  Generation of stable lung cancer cell lines expressing TP receptors revealed a higher proliferative advantage of cells expressing TPα when compared to the vector control. U46619 induced activation of TP receptors designated a time dependent stimulation of phosphorylated Erk in stable lung cancer cell lines. Evidence suggested the involvement of phosphorylated Akt in U46619 mediated TP activation. Data indicated differential activation of phosphorylated Erk isoforms. The significance of this observation requires further investigation. TP activation seemed to be positively correlated with β-catenin expression. In conclusion, translational studies on the thromboxane receptor reveal major functions in cancer pathogenesis. Therapeutic targeting of the TP receptor could prove beneficial for cancer patients.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of KNDy Neuron Peptides on Prolactin and Luteinizing Hormone in Pup-Deprived Lactating Rats</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Barnard, Amanda Leann</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Lactation is the final stage of reproduction in mammals and is characterized by chronically elevated prolactin and suppressed luteinizing hormone. The neuroendocrine regulation of prolactin and luteinizing hormone during lactation are not fully understood. In the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus is a population of neurons known as KNDy neurons because they co-express the neuropeptides Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B and Dynorphin. These neurons are known to project to gonadotropin-releasing hormone cell bodes in the preoptic area and nerve terminals in the median eminence, which regulate the secretion of luteinizing hormone, and to dopaminergic tuberoinfundibular neurons in the arcuate nucleus, which are known to regulate prolactin. Because KNDy neurons project to neuronal populations known to regulate both prolactin and luteinizing hormone, the general hypothesis for these studies is that neuropeptides Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B and Dynorphin play a role in regulating these hormones or are regulated by these hormones during lactation. In a model of lactating rats deprived of their pups for 24 hours, intracerebroventricular injection of an endogenous Kisspeptin receptor ligand, Kp-10, modestly increased prolactin secretion and markedly increased luteinizing hormone secretion. Neither Neurokinin B nor the Neurokinin B receptor agonist, Senktide, had a significant effect on either hormone in this rat model. Dynorphin and U-50,488, a kappa opioid receptor agonist, robustly increased prolactin although no changes were measured in luteinizing hormone levels. In this model of 24-hour pup-deprived lactating rats, prolactin was responsive to kappa opioid receptor agonists and luteinizing hormone was responsive to Kisspeptin receptor agonists.  In a second set of experiments, sense and anti-sense in situ hybridization probes were developed for Kiss1, the Kisspeptin gene, and Tac2, the gene encoding Neurokinin B. It was confirmed that the cDNA sequences cloned for these mRNAs were correct and were highly homologous to published rat mRNA sequences. In situ hybridization was performed using the Kiss1 and Tac2 probes, as well as a probe for Pdyn, which encodes Dynorphin. No specific cytoplasmic signal was observed using any of the three sense probes. With the anti-sense probes, clusters of reduced silver grains representing Kiss1, Tac2 and Pdyn  mRNAs were observed in the arcuate nucleus, lateral to the third ventricle and superior to the median eminence. These expression patterns were consistent with the published literature. Also, the expression patterns for all three neuropeptides were similar to each other, suggesting that many of the arcuate nucleus neurons lateral to the third ventricle and superior to the median eminence are KNDy neurons.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Electronic Band Engineering in Epitaxial Graphene: First Principles Calculations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sirikumara, Henaka Rallage Hansika Iroshini</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this research work, we have investigated the band engineering of epitaxial graphene using first principles calculations. Epitaxial graphene on SiC (0001) surface is modified by using different methods such as intercalation, doping, passivation and oxidation. The calculations are done using Density functional theory which is implemented in quantum espresso package. In the presence of H intercalation, epitaxial graphene is shown to have p type behavior with monolayer graphene. However this behavior is different for multilayer epitaxial graphene systems, and it depended on the concentration of the H atoms. When epitaxial graphene is intercalated with Ge atoms, the Ge atoms make clusters and these clusters are responsible for the electronic properties of the epitaxial graphene systems. As a result of oxidation of epitaxial SiC surface, the graphene layer is mostly stable on the surface for both silicates and oxynitrides structures. For silicate/SiC configurations, the epitaxial graphene is shown to be less n type. For oxynitrides/ SiC configurations, epitaxial graphene is shown to be neutral. In the presence of oxygen intercalation with silicate/SiC, epitaxial graphene is shown to have p type behavior. These systematic studies of epitaxial graphene will opens up great potential for electronic applications. Additionally the resultant models can be used to guide further studies.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The magnetocaloric and thermomagnetic properties of the MnNiGe1-xAlx, Ni50Mn35(In1−xCrx)15 and (Mn1−xCrx)NiGe1.05 systems have been studied by x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and magnetization measurements.  Partial substitution of Al for Ge in MnNiGe1−xAlx results in a ﬁrst-order magnetostructural transition (MST) from a hexagonal ferromagnetic to an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic phase at 186 K (for x = 0.09).  A large magnetic entropy change of ∆SM = -17.6 J/kg K for ∆H = 5 T  was observed in the vicinity of TM = 186 K for x = 0.09. This value is comparable to those of well-known giant magnetocaloric materials, such as Gd5Si2Ge2, MnFeP0.45As0.55, and Ni50Mn37Sn13 [1]. The values of the latent heat (L = 6.6 J/g) and corresponding total entropy changes (∆ST = 35 J/kg K) have been evaluated for the MST using DSC measurements. Large negative values of ∆SM of -5.8 and -4.8 J/kg K for ∆H = 5 T in the vicinity of TC were observed for x = 0.09 and 0.085, respectively.   Partial substitution of Cr for Mn in(Mn1−xCrx)NiGe1.05 results in a MST from a hexagonal paramagnetic to an orthorhombic paramagnetic phase  near TM ~ 380 K (for x = 0.07).  Partial substitution of Cr for In in Ni50Mn35(In1−xCrx)15 shifts the magnetostructural transition to a higher temperature (TM ~ 450 K) for x = 0.1. Large magnetic entropy changes of ∆SM = -12 (J/kgK) and ∆S = -11 (J/kgK), both for a magnetic field change of 5 T, were observed in the vicinity of TM for (Mn1−xCrx)NiGe1.05 and Ni50Mn35(In1−xCrx)15, respectively.  The concentration-dependent (T-x) phase diagram of transition  temperatures (magnetic, structural, and magnetostructural) has been generated using magnetic, XRD, and DSC data. The role of magnetic and structural changes on transition temperatures are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Role of Deer Browsing on Plant Community Development and Ecosystem Functioning during Tallgrass Prairie Restoration</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Harris, Patrick Thomas</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Tallgrass prairie in North America has been highly reduced and degraded by human activity (e.g. agriculture) and now human facilitated restoration is necessary to preserve and reestablish the biodiversity, structure and function of this system. In historical tallgrass prairie large ungulates (e.g. Bison bison) were keystone species that regulated many ecosystem properties and functions. Today, restored prairie often lacks these historical ungulates and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have largely assumed the role of dominant ungulates in small, tallgrass prairie restorations. Little is known about how white-tailed deer affect the development of plant communities and ecosystem function during the onset of prairie restoration. In June 2012 an agricultural field was restored to native prairie species in Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) near Manhattan, KS. Immediately following seeding, experimental plots were established and fences were constructed in half of the plots to excluded white-tailed deer. From 2012 to 2013 deer browse of forbs, aboveground biomass (total, sown forbs, sown grasses, volunteer forbs and volunteer grasses), light availability at the soil surface, soil nutrients, and plant community composition were measure inside and outside of exclosures. The first year of this study occurred during a severe drought which diminished in year two, presenting the opportunity to examine the interaction of climate and deer browse on restoration. In plots where deer had access, the percentage of forbs browsed ranged from 1.3 to 10.5%. The effect of deer browsing on aboveground biomass varied across years for each category of biomass. Total biomass appeared to be regulated more strongly by deer than climate, as unbrowsed plots produced similar biomass in each year despite major climatic variation, while browsed plots did not follow this trend. Across all sampling periods, deer browsing increased light availability by 20%. In year two inorganic N was 19% lower in browsed plots, though potential net N mineralization did not vary between treatments. Plant communities were significantly different between years and, between browsed and unbrowsed plots as time and browsing affected community composition, diversity and richness. Deer browsing increased diversity and richness by 24% and 22% respectively. Community composition was most greatly affected by browsing in year one corresponding to the highest rates of browsing and greatest differences in aboveground biomass.  These results indicate that deer can have substantial effects on the initial establishment of prairie communities as well as resource availability from the onset of restoration.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>C3 GRASS SEEDLING INVASIBILITY AND SECONDARY SUCCESSION TRENDS IN AN OLD FIELD IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Martinez, Kelsey Anne</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background : Old fields are abandoned agricultural areas that are undergoing secondary succession. A variety of factors influence the assembly, invasibility, and species turnover during secondary succession in old fields. Old fields are important ecological research locations as an increasing amount of agricultural land is abandoned worldwide.  Objectives : 1) To determine if exotic and native &#34;invaders&#34; display differences in invasion success in an old field, and 2) To observe how native and exotic species abundances change over the course of secondary succession under predictable disturbance regimes and resource levels with regards to the Core-Satellite Species (CSS) hypothesis. Methods : An old field located in southern Illinois subject to three levels of fertilization (control, annually fertilized, and fertilized every 5 years) crossed with three levels of mowing treatments (control, spring mowed, and spring/fall mowed) established in 1996 was used to test objectives  Seedlings of C3 grasses (native and exotic) were planted within one fertilizer treatment to compare invasion success. Species composition data (species occurrence and abundance at three heights) in all blocks were previously collected from 1996 to 2002 and the sample plots were resampled in 2013. Species sampled in 2013 were assigned to core or satellite categories per the CSS hypothesis. Results : Invading exotic seedlings had higher survivorship than invading native seedlings from the same functional group within the same fertilizer level, and added fertilizer increased seedling survivorship. The number of core and satellite species varied early after experiment establishment in 1996 but has since leveled off, and the ratio of exotic to native species cover at heights   &#60;1m  ratio was affected by an interaction between mowing treatment and time. The species occupancy distribution of all species in 2013 was not bimodally distributed, but the occupancy distribution of exotic species in 2013 was bimodally distributed.The community composition of the plots varied among blocks, but was affected by an interaction between fertilizer treatment and mowing.  Conclusions : Exotic invading grass seedlings in a successional community were relatively more successful than native invading grass seedlings. However, overall survivorship of all invading grass seedlings was low, a typical finding in grasslands. The identity of core and satellite species continued to fluctuate through time following 17 years of secondary succession. Resource availability and disturbance regime affects on community composition throughout secondary succession, and may result in many alternative stable states. This research supports the `CSS&#39; and `parallel dynamics&#39; hypotheses and indicates that presence of exotic species within a community does not necessarily facilitate invasion by new exotic species.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>THE IMPACT OF LANGUAGE AND MUSIC EXPERIENCE ON AUDITORY INHIBITORY CONTROL</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Graham, Robert Edward</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Previous research has indicated that musicians and bilinguals demonstrate potential cognitive benefits due to their long-term experience with music and two or more languages, respectively. For the present study, such a benefit is examined in the context of auditory inhibitory control. An auditory version of the Stroop task involving pitch and language (as used by Bialystok &#38; DePape, 2009) was used and expanded upon. Separate groups of monolinguals, monolingual musicians, bilinguals, and tone-language bilinguals were established to investigate not only musical and bilingual experience in general, but also to determine if there is an effect of type of language on auditory inhibitory control. Additionally, a contour-based auditory Stroop task (with rising and falling tone patterns) was implemented to investigate a different dimension of auditory perception. Differences in reaction time were measured as indicators of inhibitory control.  The results suggest an advantage for monolingual musicians, while a possible language effect may be detrimental to performance for bilinguals on language-based tasks. The results indicate possible shared underlying cognitive resources given the apparent transferable auditory processing benefits for musicians. The implications of these results are discussed, and future directions are proposed to address factors such as age, behavioral vs. physiological effects, and whether the performance of bilinguals is due to the nature of being bilingual, or taking the task in a non-native language.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A PRECLINICAL EVALUATION OF MEMANTINE AS A TREATMENT FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Elmore, Brandy Elizabeth</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The goal of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of memantine on functional recovery following a cortical contusion impact (CCI) traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a rodent model. A unilateral parietal injury was induced and compared to open sham surgeries under controlled experimental conditions. Animals were randomly assigned to a sham group, vehicle-treated injured group, or memantine-treated injured group. Dosage regimens were designed to provide serum concentrations in the range obtained with clinically approved doses, using both a low (5 mg/kg) and high (20 mg/kg) dose for 48 h. Functional recovery was assessed using five behavioral assessments, as well as neuropathological measurements. Motor function was observed using the locomotor placing task, the rotor-rod procedure, and a photobeam activity monitoring system. Cognitive function as learning ability was assessed through the Morris Water Maze and a passive avoidance assessment. Memantine did not improve motor or cognitive function in any of the behavioral assessments. These results indicate that while memantine may provide benefits at a neurobiological level, its therapeutic potential on the recovery of behavioral function following TBI is severely limited.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Impact of Language and Disability Type on Attitudes Toward Persons with Disabilities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Payne, Courtney</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study explored the ways in which the type of language used can influence attitudes about people with disabilities.  The extent to which positive, neutral, or negative language about different disabilities influences able-bodied people&#39;s attitudes about those with disabilities was tested. This study examined the impact of language on the ways that different types of disabilities are perceived by exposing participants to one of three different language types about the disabled through vignettes. Participants were then asked to rank their preferences for roommates based on the person having one of five different disabilities. Overall attitudes towards the disabled did not differ based on the type of language participants were exposed to, but the Behaviors sub-scale of the Multidimensional Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons Scale (MAS; Findler, Vilchinsky, &#38; Werner, 2007) showed significantly different scores for the negative (M = 19.79) and positive (M = 23.00) language conditions. Preferences for roommates were ranked differently based on the type of disability described in the vignette. The types of disabilities were ranked in the following order, from most to least preferable: (a) health condition (diabetes), (b) learning disability (dyslexia) (c) mental illness (PTSD), (d) deafness, and (e) mobility impairment (cerebral palsy).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Agency and Power in the Lives of African American Women: The Role of Personal Beliefs of Justice in the Discrimination - Personal Control Link</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Amuzu, Elom A.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In an effort to extend the literature (e.g., Landry &#38; Mercurio, 2009; Moradi &#38; Hasan, 2004) on the effects of discrimination on personal sense of control, this current study aims to examine how African American women&#39;s sense of personal control is affected by their beliefs about discrimination and how their beliefs about justice and fairness in their own lives further explain the relationship. A total of 173 African American or Black identified women were recruited through professional contacts, an undergraduate psychology course, and social media networking sites. Participants&#39; awareness of discrimination was experimentally manipulated by random assignment to one of four conditions suggesting varying likelihoods of personally experiencing discrimination. Participants responded to self-report instruments of Personal Beliefs in a Just World (Dalbert, 1999) before the manipulation and Environmental Mastery (Ryff, 1989; measure of personal control) as the dependent variable after the manipulation. It was predicted that a significant interaction term between experimental condition and just world beliefs on personal control would supersede any main effects. Yet only a significant main effect was found between personal beliefs in a just world and personal control, with no significant interaction effects.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Examining the Effects of Time-Based and Quantity-Based Reinforcement on the Persistence of Behavior</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Martin, Heather Rachelle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examined response persistence during extinction following the delivery of quantity- or time-based reinforcers. Three typically developing preschool students participated in the study. In Experiment 1, equally preferred quantity-based and time-based reinforcers were identified for each participant. In Experiment 2, response persistence was evaluated during extinction following a period of reinforcement using equivalent variable interval schedules assigned to each reinforcement type. The results of this research further support the finding that reinforcement rate is a predictor of persistence (Nevin, 1974). However, type of reinforcer (i.e., quantity-based or time-based) did not have a uniform effect on the persistence of responding once extinction was implemented.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Teaching Multiple Response Alternatives to Mitigate Resurgence</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carrasquillo, Travis</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The current study tested the potential of teaching multiple response alternatives to mitigate resurgence of a target response. Two experimental arrangements were alternated. In one component a target response was reinforced, then an alternative response was reinforced while the target response was placed on extinction. In the final phase, both responses were placed on extinction. In the second component, a target response was reinforced, then four alternative responses were reinforced while the target response was placed on extinction. In the final phase, all responses were placed on extinction. Six of nine participants demonstrated lower resurgence of the target response following reinforcement of multiple response alternatives. The results of this study suggest teaching multiple response alternatives is a possible treatment strategy to mitigate response resurgence.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Vocabulary Learning Strategies: A Study of Congolese English Language Learners</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kaya, Jean</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The present study investigated the most and least frequent vocabulary learning strategies that English language teachers in Congo encourage students to use, and the strategies that Congolese students actually use to build their vocabulary. Finding out whether the students&#39; most used strategies were teacher-encouraged or independently learned was another point of interest. A Likert-scale of 34 statements and four short-answer questions was designed to collect data. The participants included 20 male and 23 female Congolese learners of English of ages 18 to 22, all of them students in the Arts program at the Reconciliation High School in Brazzaville, Congo.  Statistical and content analysis methods were employed. Attention to suffixes was the only strategy that showed a significant difference between the teacher encouraged and student used strategies. Two other strategies, guessing word meanings from context and learning words in collocations approached significance, but the difference between teacher encouragement and student use was not of practical importance. This strong correspondence between the strategies that teachers frequently encourage and students&#39; use provided evidence about the important role that language teachers play in students&#39; learning in general, and in strategy in particular.   Quantitative results revealed contextual guessing and dictionary use to be the most frequently used strategies, whereas pronunciation was the least frequently used. Participants&#39; narrative descriptions revealed that notebooks and notepads were frequently used in participants&#39; independent learning of vocabulary. Furthermore, 52.38% (N= 22) of the participants attributed their frequently-used strategies to their teachers&#39; practices and advice while 38.10% (N= 16) claimed that their strategies were independently learned.  In view of theory and empirical research, the present study provided evidence that Congolese learners of English are taking responsibilities about their vocabulary learning progress by employing a variety of strategies, some of them acquired as a result of classroom learning, whereas others developed in their independent learning outside of school.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>ARE TEACHERS READY FOR ELF? EVIDENCE FROM NON-NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKING MA TESOL STUDENTS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lopez Jaramillo, Maria Gabriela</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study aimed to explore whether non-native English-language teachers were aware of the existence of the English as a Lingua Franca paradigm and to examine their aspirations and preferences for themselves and their students as learners of English. Five research questions guided the study: 1) What variety of English do non-native teachers aspire to for themselves? 2) What variety of English do non-native teachers aspire to for their students? 3) What environments (native vs. non-native) do they consider to be most conducive for the acquisition of English? 4) Do they emphasize accuracy vs. intelligibility? 5) Is there a relationship between their aspirations and their preferences for accuracy and/or acceptability? The findings provided empirical evidence that non-native English teachers are aware of the different English varieties. The participating teachers seemed to put higher emphasis on intelligibility than on grammatical accuracy if they thought that certain utterances would not impede international communication. The results also revealed a dual orientation in participants&#39; aspirations, where their awareness of the diversity of English varieties and their emphasis on intelligibility was paradoxically contradicted by their own strong preferences for native-like models of pronunciation and lexical knowledge.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Die Fledermaus: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Trim</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Watkins, Lillian Casey</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Lillian Casey Watkins, for the Masters in Fine Arts degree in Theater, presented on May 2, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.  TITLE:  DIE FLEDERMAUS: OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE TRIM MAJOR PROFESSOR:  Wendi Zea 	In February of 2014, the School of Music and the Department of Theater at Southern Illinois University presented a production of the operetta Die Fledermaus.  This thesis is a presentation of the process and final product of the costume design of that production.  Die Fledermaus exhibits the best of carnival escapism, with daring disguises, topsy turvy scenarios, opulent scenes and extravagant use of alcohol.  This design project was an attempt at capturing that escapism and expressing it through costuming, paying particular attention to detail and trim and actor movement and dance, creating the bubbly, champagne-filled fantasy that is Die Fledermaus. 	Chapter 1 contains research and analysis of the script, including information about the composer, cultural and historical occurrences that inform the script and previous production history and critical analysis.  Chapter 2 focuses on analysis of the characters and their relationships, and how those inform the design of their costumes.  The goals that I wished to accomplish with the design and production of the show are covered within Chapter 3.  Chapter 4 documents my design process, leading to Chapters 5 and 6, which document the build and production processes, respectively.  Chapter 7 is an analysis of the full process and production itself, in regards to the fulfillment of the aforementioned goals.  The appendices contain renderings, research, production paperwork and photos.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>EVALUATION OF MOVEMENT RATES OF VHS-SUSCEPTIBLE FISH SPECIES BETWEEEN LAKE MICHIGAN AND THE CHICAGO AREA WATERWAY SYSTEM AND IMPLICATIONS FOR VHS MANAGEMENT IN ILLINOIS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yung, Andrew J.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Since the discovery of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS) in the Great Lakes in 2005, the assessment of its ability to spread amongst connected watersheds has been at the forefront of VHS management.  This project was designed to determine a rate of passage of VHS-susceptible fish species between coastal Lake Michigan and its harbors and the artificial waterways in the Chicago metropolitan area.  This information can be used to assess the potential for VHS to spread into the waterways, which drain into the Illinois River watershed.  Although fishes (e.g. Round Goby and occasionally salmonids) are known to have moved from Lake Michigan into the Illinois River via the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), the rate of fish passage from the lake into the waterway system is unclear. To directly assess fish movement, a total of 1216 fish were collected, tagged, and returned to Lake Michigan harbors (532, 43.8% of total) and Lake Calumet (684, 56.2%), an adjacent lake connected to Lake Michigan via the CAWS. Fishermen reports, Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) sampling, and subsequent electrofishing sampling trips yielded 51 recaptured fish (4.2% of tagged fish).  Of these, 2 fish were recaptured below the O¡¯Brien Lock and Dam in the Calumet River (south of Lake Michigan and Lake Calumet) and 49 fish were recaptured in the location at which they were originally tagged. To further assess movement of VHS susceptible species between Lake Michigan and the CAWS, otoliths were collected from 375 small-bodied fish (&#60;150 mm total length) captured in the CAWS and analyzed for ¥ä©ö©øC to determine the origin (Lake Michigan or CAWS) of these fish. Fifty-six percent of small-bodied fishes collected from the Calumet River were immigrants from Lake Michigan, whereas 35% of fish collected from the Chicago River and 28% of fish collected from the North Shore Channel were immigrants.  Results indicate that fishes (particularly small-bodied species such as Round Goby) move between VHS-positive Lake Michigan into the VHS-negative Chicago area waterways and represent a potential vector for VHS to spread into the inland waters of Illinois.  However, the lack of movement of fishes from Lake Michigan into the Des Plaines River and further downstream waters also indicates a watershed-based approach to managing VHS in Illinois waters rather than simply designating the entire state as VHS-affected due to positive samples in Lake Michigan, may be valid.  VHS surveillance should be continued in the CAWS to ensure the status of these water bodies as ¡°VHS positive¡± or ¡°VHS negative¡± is accurate, as this is useful for informing the public and creating policies and regulations to attempt to slow the spread of this disease.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>BUILDING A &#34;DRUM SET&#34;: DESIGNING THE SCENERY FOR SAM SHEPARD&#39;S FOOL FOR LOVE</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Brown, Kieran Pearse</dc:creator>
<dc:description>I designed the set for Fool For Love by Sam Shepard in the McLeod Theater, Fall Semester 2013 for my thesis production. Fool For Love Is a short and intense hyper-realistic play about two lovers with a dark past. The entire play takes place in one extended scene in a motel room on the edge of the desert. Eddie tries to win May back, while she tries to free herself from her need to go back to him. The Old Man is a figure outside of reality that intrudes on the play, the father they share and the source of the shame in their relationship. A suitor, Martin, appears to set this combustible mixture off. 	I designed a cramped and derelict space which pushed the auditory surrealism of the play and made the experience as intimate and intense as I could for the audience. 	Chapter 1 contains me research and initial response to both the script and the thesis process. Chapter 2 walks through the process of designing and building the show. Chapter 3 reflects on my performance overall. Chapter 4 is a deeper look into design communication, a weakness this process revealed in my work.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF UV ATTENUATION: NATURAL SUNSCREEN IN A CHANGING WORLD</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jordan, Kristen</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) is a substance produced by the planktonic community that naturally blocks biologically damaging, ultraviolet radiation (UV; wavelengths = 280 to 400 nm). While a variety of planktonic species produce CDOM, investigations into the quality and quantity of their CDOM production are few. The purpose of this study was to investigate the properties of CDOM produced by phytoplankton versus zooplankton. Typically, UV radiation breaks down CDOM. However, marine organisms sometimes produce CDOM that, when exposed to sunlight, increases its absorbance of UV radiation. The reasons for this anomaly and the source of this unusual CDOM are unclear. To test for distinctions among sources, filtered water samples from cultures of two marine phytoplankton, Gymnodinium sp. and Dunaliella sp., and a marine copepod, Tigriopus californicus were exposed to sunlight for intervals of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours. The maximal UVB radiation (wavelengths; λ = 280 to 320 nm) was 0.1699 J cm-2. Before and after sunlight exposures, CDOM sources were assessed by comparing absorbance spectra from 184 to 730 nm with detailed comparisons at wavelengths of 254, 305, 320, and 350 nm. Results are expressed as &#34;absorption&#34;, which is the raw absorbance converted to the natural log. Before exposure to sunlight, CDOM from algal species had 5- to 8-times higher average absorption values across UV wavelengths than CDOM produced by Tigriopus. CDOM samples produced by phytoplankton were more susceptible to photochemical change than CDOM from Tigriopus. In response to sunlight, CDOM from Gymnodinium varied greatly, increasing in UV absorption in 2 out of 5 replicates but decreasing in absorption in the other replicates. In contrast, peak absorption at λ = 260 nm of CDOM from Dunaliella decreased directionally by an average of 76% in absorption and 75% in specific absorption, and this decrease in absorption was significant (p = 0.03). CDOM from Tigriopus significantly decreased in both absorption (all UV wavelengths, p &#60; 0.01) and &#34;specific absorption&#34;, which is absorption standardized per mg of dissolved organic carbon (λ = 320 nm; p &#60; 0.03), but the magnitude of change was only 17%. Thus, photochemical responses of CDOM from the three planktonic sources demonstrated more, consistently less, and unchanged UV absorption. Phytoplankton biomass, which is greater than that of copepods at the next trophic level, likely produce more CDOM but because of greater variability in CDOM absorbance of UV both within and between algal sources, copepods may offer a more stable source of UV protection depending on sunlight exposure and their relative abundance. Definitive conclusions depend on future laboratory studies expanded to more planktonic organisms as well as in situ studies during oceanographic cruises to test the relative contributions of planktonic species.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>IS DISRUPTION TO PASSIVE GAS-EXCHANGE A MECHANISM OF DEHYDRATION FOR WNS-INFECTED HIBERNATING BATS?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Carey, Charleve</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Emergent epizootics are responsible for dramatic declines in wildlife populations over the past few years. An emerging fungal-borne epizootic, called white-nose syndrome (WNS), is responsible for a catastrophic decline of hibernating bats in North America The fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), is the causative agent of WNS, but to date, we have limited understanding of how an infection with Pd can lead to mortality in hibernating bats. Evidence suggests dehydration is an important part of the pathogenesis of WNS. Cryan et al. (2010) proposed four possible mechanisms by which infection could lead to dehydration. In this study, I tested one of these hypotheses - Pd infection could cause disruption to passive gas-exchange pathways across the wing membranes, thereby causing a compensatory increase in water-intensive pulmonary respiration. I hypothesized total evaporative water loss would be greater when passive gas-exchange was inhibited, especially at low ambient temperatures. I found that bats did not lose more water when passive gas-exchange was retarded (at least within the resolution of my equipment). This study provides evidence against the proposed proximal mechanism that disruption to passive gas-exchange causes dehydration and ultimately death to WNS-infected bats.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>CUSTOMERS&#39; EMOTIONAL AND COPING RESPONSES TO SERVICE FAILURES: THE ROLE OF SELF-CONGRUENCE</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wei, Shuqin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Because service failures are inevitable, marketing researchers have devoted considerable attention to the negative consequences of service failure and corresponding service recovery strategies. Previous research has overwhelmingly focused on customers&#39; cognitive, coping, and behavioral reactions to failures. However, more recently, researchers have suggested that emotions may underlie the effects of customers&#39; cognitive responses on their coping and behavioral responses. Despite the increased attention paid to the emotional dimension of customers&#39; responses, the literature has not differentiated between different types of negative emotions. However, the appropriateness of service recovery strategies may rely on differentiating between similarly valenced emotions, because distinct emotions may require different recovery strategies. From a perspective of self-congruence theory, this dissertation contributes to the extant literature by investigating why customers experience distinct negative emotions - basic emotions (e.g., anger) and self-conscious emotions (e.g., shame) - in the context of service failure. Since emotions may influence coping and behavioral responses, distinct sets of coping responses (problem-solving vs. vindictive complaining and support-seeking vs. vindictive negative word of mouth) and behavioral intentions are also explored. Through two experiments, this dissertation provides support for the proposition that different forms of self-congruence evoke different sets of emotional and coping responses. Furthermore, drawing on self-awareness theory, this dissertation provides evidence for the proposition that the mechanisms underlying these observed patterns are distinct. Specifically, when service failures are involved, actual self-congruence and ideal self-congruence differentially trigger public self-awareness and private self-awareness and the different forms of self-awareness mediate the effect of self-congruence on customers&#39; emotions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>PSEUDO DIAMETER - A NOVEL CONCEPT IN DESIGNING HIGHLY BANDWIDTH EFFICIENT MULTICAST ROUTING PROTOCOLS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Koneru, Sindoora</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Multicasting is preferred over multiple unicasts from the viewpoint of better utilization of one of the most important network resources, namely network bandwidth. Multicasting can be done in two different ways: source based tree approach and shared tree approach. This research focuses on improving bandwidth utilization of source based multicast routing protocols and also provides core selection approaches for shared tree multicasting. In this work, we have defined new concepts called pseudo diameter and super pseudo diameter by using the routing information present in Distance Vector Routing (DVR) tables. Pseudo diameter relates to the physical locations of routers and is used to control the flow of packets along the broadcast tree. Super pseudo diameter relates to the physical location of group members and is used to control the flow of packets along the multicast tree. This location aspect of routers and group members have been incorporated into the existing broadcast and multicast protocols to achieve a much improved bandwidth utilization compared to the existing approaches.  These concepts have also been used in developing both static and group based core selection approaches. Pseudo diameter used in static core selection approach, and super pseudo diameter used in group based core selection approach, generates secondary and tertiary cores along with primary core to achieve fault tolerance.  Besides DVR, the other widely used unicast routing protocol is the Link State Routing protocol (LSR). We have shown that a similar concept to pseudo diameter called sub diameter can be used on networks using LSR tables to achieve better bandwidth utilization in source based multicasting and in selecting a core for shared tree multicasting.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Cross-Cultural Study of Socioeconomic Status, Parental involvement, and Students&#39; Mathematics Achievement</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alghazo, Yazan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>There is a growing interest in studying the influence of parental involvement on student achievement, as well as factors that influence parents&#39; choices in being involved in their children&#39;s education. This study examined the relationships among socioeconomic status, parental involvement, and students&#39; mathematics achievement in Jordan and the United States. It also investigated the reasons that motivate parental involvement in both Jordan and the United States. For data collection, a four-section instrument was distributed to parents/guardians of students in grades four, five, and six from Jordan and the United States in order to collect demographic information, socioeconomic status, parental involvement levels, mathematics achievement, and qualitative data about the nature of parental involvement and parents&#39; reasons for being involved in their children&#39;s mathematical education.       The study revealed no relationship between socioeconomic status and parental involvement in Jordan.   In the United States, however, the study revealed a positive relationship between socio-economic status and parental involvement at home; only parents&#39; education level had a statistically significant relationship with parental involvement at school.  The study further revealed a positive relationship between parental involvement at home (PIH) and students&#39; mathematics achievement (SMA) in both Jordan and the United States. Also, a positive relationship between parental involvement at school (PISC) and students&#39; mathematics achievement (SMA) was observed in the Jordan sample. However, no relationship between PISC and SMA was found in the United States sample. Also, the findings revealed a positive correlation between SES and SMA for the United States sample. However, in the Jordan sample, a positive relationship existed between family income and SMA, and parents&#39; education level and SMA, while no relationship was found between parents&#39; employment status and SMA.  Furthermore, the findings revealed a significant difference only between the correlation coefficients of PIH and SMA between Jordan and the United States.      The findings of the qualitative data analysis did not particularly support the quantitative findings, but they did provide a clear understanding of parents&#39; diverse reasons for why they chose to be involved in their children&#39;s education, such as social and economic gains for their children. It also showed what parents believed affected or influenced their ability or choices with regard to being involved in their children&#39;s education.  In light of the findings, a number of recommendations were given for further research and practice, specifically with regard to curriculum development and the design of parent-school communication programs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>EFFECTS OF USING VIDEO, AUDIO, OR MIXED CHANNELS FOR VICARIOUS LEARNER INTERACTIONS IN A SYNCHRONOUS E-LEARNING ENVIRONMENT</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sarmiento, Roman Eduardo</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Technology changes often force teachers, trainers, instructional designers, and administrators to make instructional design and delivery decisions that ideally should be based upon pedagogy research. In many circumstances, however, a foundational pedagogy question is only recognized when a technology decision reveals it. Such is the case when deciding what mode (video or audio) to use for learner interaction in a synchronous online learning event. While some research has focused on the learning and the satisfaction of learners when they were interacting, almost no research has addressed the learning value of observing the interactions of other learners. The purpose of this research study was to investigate whether the mode in which direct learner interactions were made affected non-interacting learners&#39; recall of content in a synchronous virtual learning environment. The participants in this study viewed one of three versions of a webinar on Multimedia Games for Learning: a) all learners interacted in video mode; b) all learners interacted in audio mode; or all learners interacted in both video and audio in a mixed mode. No statistically significant difference was found between the video, audio, and mixed treatment conditions in terms of the recall of content from the questions or comments made by directly interacting learners. However, a statically significant difference was found in non-interacting learners&#39; recall of the contributions of direct interactors based on the mode of interaction within the mixed-mode group. Study participants recalled more of the contributions made in the audio mode of interaction than in the video mode when the modes were mixed. These findings suggest that designers of synchronous online learning may choose either video or audio mode without affecting those learners who are not directly interacting but should take care in mixing interaction modes within a single synchronous online learning event.   The contributions of the study reach beyond the findings. The study supports vicarious interaction as a process worthy of research and e-Learning design consideration. It provides a model for experimental manipulation of &#34;simulated&#34; synchronous sessions, and it introduces recall of others&#39; verbal contributions as an approach to measurement of the attention granted vicarious interactions by those not interacting directly with others.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Growth, Poverty, and Capital Structure Effects of Financial Development</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Donou-Adonsou, Ficawoyi</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Financial development has been on target in the literature for the past two decades. Different aspects of this topic have been debated, most notably its growth aspect that is widely discussed. The main conclusion of this discussion is that financial development can cause growth as well as growth can cause financial development. Although poverty has been also discussed, not a lot of studies have tried to understand the causal relationship between financial development and poverty. Moreover, when talking about financial development, most studies focus on bank finance and equity finance as the main channels of financial development.  The advent of microfinance lets to think about the potential role these institutions can play in a countrywide economy. Many studies have found evidence of increases in consumption, savings, and poverty alleviation as the results of microfinance loans at the community level, but not much has been said at the countrywide level. Some theoretical papers have found aggregate level evidence of microfinance, but this evidence has not been yet under empirical investigations. The first two chapters of this dissertation empirically investigate respectively growth and poverty effects of microfinance and compare them with traditional banks using the financial development framework. Chapter 1, entitled &#34;Growth effect of banks and microfinance: Evidence from developing countries,&#34; considers both the banking and microfinance sectors and analyzes their growth effect using traditional measures of financial development such as credit to GDP ratio. Using a panel of 72 developing countries over the period 2002-2011, we find with the system GMM estimator that microfinance loans do exhibit strong growth effect. As for bank loans, there is no strong evidence of growth effect. However, the analysis from the investment perspective tells quite the opposite story: Bank loans do have investment effect, while microfinance loans do not show strong evidence of investment effect. These results suggest that microfinance loans are not primarily invested as physical capital, but could increase total factor productivity, whereas banks may have been financing non-productive investments in developing countries.  In chapter 2, entitled &#34;Financial development and poverty reduction in developing countries,&#34; the objective is to analyze the relationship between financial development and poverty reduction and the extent to which banks and microfinance reduce poverty. We use Geweke (1982) linear feedback method and measure the extent to which banks and microfinance contribute to poverty alleviation. With data on 71 developing countries over the period 2002-2011, we find in most cases that microfinance reduces poverty more than banks, but requires some income level to expand its activities. However, we do not find strong evidence that the whole financial system reduces poverty more than the individual financial institutions. While our first result suggests that microfinance does not service the very poor, our second result suggests that that individual institutions are in most cases more beneficial than the whole financial system. The third chapter, entitled &#34;Financial development and capital structure of firms,&#34; discusses another aspect of financial development usually found in the finance literature. This chapter examines the relationship between financial development and capital structure and analyzes how capital structure might change due to the global financial crisis. We use aggregate data, computed from 5,000 publicly traded firms from 1990 to 2012. The results indicate with the instrumental variable-generalized method of moments methodology that financial development, measured by bank finance and equity finance, has positive effects on capital structure. However, the analysis with respect to the debt maturity indicates that these effects vary with the maturity and the type of finance. While the results are similar in developed countries except in the short-run, in developing countries, only bank finance has significant effects. Our results seem to be consistent with the pecking order theory and suggest that firms in developed countries prefer debt to equity despite the expansion of the equity market, whereas firms in developing countries rely on bank finance. Further, the results show that the subprime crisis has changed firms&#39; capital structure. In developed countries, the crisis has reduced short-term and total debt, whereas in developing countries, it affects more long-term debt. This latter result suggests that developing countries are more resilient to the crisis.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Empirical Analysis of Foreign Aid Heterogeneity According to Donors for Pakistan</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Abdiah, Suleman</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation is compiled of three chapters in determining the effect of bilateral foreign assistance on the economy of Pakistan. The effect of foreign assistance will be measured in terms of public expenditure and revenue. The factors associated in the provision of aid commitments and disbursements, and the effect of bilateral assistance on the production efficiency of Pakistan.    Chapter 1 uses an aid disaggregation approach to examine the impact of different types of bilateral donors on the fiscal sector of Pakistan, an important aid recipient in recent years.  The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of bilateral aid on the economy of Pakistan, from the four largest donors, which include the USA, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Time series data for the period 1972-2010 were analyzed along with an estimation of a fiscal response model following Mavrotas (2005) that combines both aid disaggregation in terms of types of aid and the treatment of endogeneity. The empirical estimation of the structural equations and reduced form equations, using nonlinear three stage least squares estimation clearly suggests the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues. Since different bilateral donors have different effects on key fiscal variables, an impact could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed. While aid from Japan increases public investment, aid from the USA, the UK, and Germany appears to cause a reduction in public investment. Similarly, aid from Japan reduces public consumption, but the aid from other donors causes an increase in public consumption. In regards to tax revenue, the aid flows from the USA, the UK and Germany leads to a reduction in tax revenue, but aid flow from Japan increases tax revenue.      Chapter 2 investigates the relation between aid disbursements and aid commitments from the fourteen largest donors to Pakistan, and determine the factor that effects commitments and the disbursements. The time series data was employed for the period 1972-2010. The estimation of the model through fixed effect approach and two stage least squares approach showed that aid disbursements, aid commitment from donors to African countries, and Pakistan&#39;s membership at the United Nations Security Council effects aid commitments positively and significantly. But, the inverse relation existed between GDP per capita of Pakistan and aid commitments. Similarly, aid commitments relation with the aid disbursements was positive and significant. The war in Afghanistan during any time between1972-2010 increases the aid disbursement to Pakistan. It was also determined that if the level of primary education increases, the aid disbursement to Pakistan decreases. The results also showed that when Pakistan is ruled by the military government the aid disbursements to Pakistan reduces.  Chapter 3 focus is to see the impact of different bilateral donors on the production inefficiency of the Pakistan. To empirically estimate the effect of bilateral aid heterogeneity on production inefficiency, we use the time series data for Pakistan for the period 1972-2010. The stochastic frontier analysis was conducted using maximum likelihood estimation. The results determined that the aid from the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany tends to increase production efficiency of Pakistan. However on the contrary aid from Japan tends to decrease production efficiency. It was also concluded from the results that foreign direct investment and public investment also increases production efficiency. But, the relation between human capital and production efficiency was negative. Also, the results indicated that when Pakistan is ruled by the military government the aid flows from the USA and UK reduces production efficiency.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>An Empirical Approach to Social Networks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Reed, Markum L.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Social networks tend to shape our views about the world. Our study conducts an empirical analysis of social network dynamics using Twitter data. We ask whether social networks influence voting decisions, and determine whether or not people make consistent choices based on their tweets or what they believe. We collect Twitter data on a daily basis, with dynamic social network measurements before, during, and after  the 2012 Presidential election. We identify how people should believe based on  their ideological profiles. We use lexicographical analysis to check if ideological key words  are present in a user&#39;s tweets, and if the overall sentiment on this issue is positive or negative.  We utilize this data to determine how people should have chosen an outcome which may conflict with an individual&#39;s observed declaration of political ideology. We are able to determine what percentage of the population  made a consistent choices based on their Tweets during the 2012 presidential election. Additionally, we examine the social network structure in Twitter and how it affects  voting. We illustrate that an individual&#39;s political ideology is influenced by others in their network.\\ Consumer confidence is an economic indicator which measures the degree of optimism that consumers feel about the overall state of the economy as well as their personal financial situation. We will show that consumer sentiment can be measured via analysis of social networks. Specifically, we perform a lexicographic analysis of Twitter data over a three month period. After careful analysis, we find that not only does talk intensity of economic issues cause shifts in the daily stock market prices but has a significant negative affect.\\ The study of religion has enjoyed distinction and legitimacy within sociology, psychology, anthropology, and political science for many years. This paper concerns the extent to which economic opinion is embedded in structure of religious social relations. We hope to enhance the empirical study of homophily and the economics of behavior by showing how beliefs, norms, and values are affected by religion and, by extension, morals, and culture.  We utilize a technique called cluster analysis to determine homophilic ties within a single attribute, religiosity. We see that religion affects economic attitudes and activities of individuals, groups, and societies. Further, religion influences how behavior and institutions are affected by social relations and in our case homophily. This influence is one of the classic questions of social theory.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>THE CHALLENGES OF EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRACY: SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA IN AN ERA OF GLOBALIZATION</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tchinsala, Yonmon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Scholars agree that there may be no better time for Sub-Saharan African countries to create the conditions for a more peaceful and democratic reality than now. This optimism is driven in part by the possibilities for development unleashed by neoliberal globalization and the current tremendous human and material potential of African countries.  Where consensus fails, however, is how to create these peaceful and democratic conditions.  As the status quo of transition countries in Sub-Saharan African countries shows, the amalgamation of the distant legacy of the colonial past and the not so promising threats of the deleterious effects of neoliberal globalization are creating a mix of prosaic socio-political delirium that compromises possibilities for democratic participation and peaceful coexistence. Perhaps the new threat yet that is driving this optimism down within the region is the emergence of Islamic radicalism that has unleashed a wave of terror activities in countries such as Nigeria, Mali, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania.  Still, education for democracy has and can significantly mitigate rampant acts of violence and help countries move towards a more peaceful and democratic reality. And this begs the question: In light of the challenges of neoliberal globalization, how can education contribute to building peace and promoting democratic citizenship in Sub-Saharan Africa?  Extant research suggests that since the end of the Cold War, many Sub-Saharan African countries have been going through severe crises, most of which involve violent conflicts. Although these violent conflicts have been attracting attention within the international community in general, and the academic circle in particular, violence continues. We are yet to find effective ways to address it and to develop theoretical and practical resources that can help us to work towards more peaceful realities. Using critical theory, in this study I bring the literature on peace and democratic education to the SSA context in order to rethink how education may better contribute to peace efforts.  Findings from this study suggest that critical democratic education can help birth a more democratic and peaceful reality in transition countries in Sub-Saharan countries. However, in order to achieve this goal, substantive reforms are needed in the current education systems. Additionally, school stakeholders must receive the training needed about practical ways to employ this vision of education.  It is my hope that the results of this study will enhance our understanding of the process of deploying education in support of democracy in post-conflict countries within an era of globalization where the demands upon educational institutions to support economies are serious distractions from the core problems that post-conflict countries face.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Malaysian Counselor Supervisor Development: The Effect of Counselor Supervisor Training, Self-Efficacy, and Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yusof, Hapsah Md</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examined factors that influence counselor supervisor development in Malaysia. The factors include counselor supervisor training, self-efficacy, and role conflict and role ambiguity. Data were collected from 290 participants who were providing clinical supervision in various settings. Participants completed either an online survey or a paper-and-pencil format on three Malay-translated version questionnaires. Structural Equation Modeling procedure was utilized to test seven hypotheses and path analysis was used to estimate model parameters. Four fit indices were utilized to assess the goodness-of-fit measurement model and the structural models. Examination of path analysis revealed five out of the seven hypotheses were supported. The results support the idea that counselor supervisor training had collective effect on counselor supervisor development, and counselor supervisor self-efficacy, but did not significantly direct effect on counselor supervisor role. In addition, the counselor supervisor self-efficacy factors reliably predicted counselor supervisor development and counselor supervisor role. Further, counselor supervisor role reliably predicted counselor supervisor development. Finally, the results showed that counselor supervisor training was not completely mediated through counselor supervisor self-efficacy; and direct effect of counselor supervisor training was found on counselor supervisor development. Implications for theory, training, and future research are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Mothering and Anxiety: An Evaluation of the Anxiety Levels of First-time Mothers in  Rural Kentucky and Rural Michigan</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chavis, Llena H.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AN ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION OF LLENA CHAVIS, for the Doctor of Philosophy degree in COUNSELING EDUCATION, presented on May 12, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. MOTHERING AND ANXIETY: AN EVALUATION OF THE ANXIETY LEVELS OF FIRST-TIME MOTHERS IN RURAL KENTUCKY AND RURAL MICHIGAN MAJOR PROFESSORS: Dr. Kimemia and Dr. Champe  Postpartum depression is thoroughly addressed in professional literature, whereas anxiety in first-time mothers is generally addressed as a component of, or with, depression.  This dissertation investigated anxiety as a phenomenon distinct from depression evaluated several variables that influence anxiety in first-time mothers.  The question, how are maternal sense of competence and perceived social support related to first-time mothers&#39; anxiety in a rural setting, when depression, socioeconomic status (SES), and marital status are controlled for was explored. The population studied in this research is made up of women with children 24 months or younger living in rural Murray, Kentucky, and rural Allegan City in Michigan. The constructs of maternal sense of competence and perceived social support were both found to be significant in explaining first-time mothers&#39; anxiety.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>EFFECTS OF STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION ON RELIABILITY OF NANOSCALE NITRIDE HEMTs</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gaddipati, Vamsi Mohan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>AlGaN based nanoscale high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are the next generation of transistor technology that features the unique combination of higher power, wider bandwidth, low noise, higher efficiency, and temperature/radiation hardness than conventional AlGaAs and Si based technologies. However, as evidenced by recent stress tests, reliability of these devices (characterized by a gradual decrease in the output current/power leading to failure of the device in just tens of hours of operation) remains a major concern. Although, in these tests, physical damages were clearly visible in the device, the root cause and nature of these damages have not yet been fully assessed experimentally. Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical study of the physical mechanisms responsible for degradation of AlGaN HEMTs is essential before these devices are deployed in targeted applications. The main objective of the proposed research is to computationally investigate how degradation of state-of-the-art nanoscale AlGaN HEMTs is governed by an intricate and dynamical coupling of thermo-electromechanical processes at different length (atoms-to-transistor) and time (femtosecondto- hours) scales while operating in high voltage, large mechanical, and high temperature/radiation stresses. This work centers around a novel hypotheses as follows: High voltage applied to AlGaN HEMT causes excessive internal heat dissipation, which triggers gate metal diffusion into the semiconducting barrier layer and structural modifications (defect ii formation) leading to diminished polarization induced charge density and output current. Since the dynamical system to be studied is complex, chaotic (where the evolution rule is guided by atomicity of the underlying material), and involve coupled physical processes, an in-house multiscale simulator (QuADS 3-D) has been employed and augmented, where material parameters are obtained atomistically using firstprinciples, structural relaxation and defect formations will be modeled by integrating molecular dynamics, and the influence of atomistic processes on charge and phonon transport and current degradation will be simulated using a coupled drift-diffusionthermodynamic framework.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Dynamic Neural Network-based Adaptive Inverse Optimal Control Design</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Alhejji, Ayman Khalid</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation introduces a Dynamical Neural Network (DNN) model based adaptive inverse optimal control design for a class of nonlinear systems. A DNN structure is developed and stabilized based on a control Lyapunov function (CLF). The CLF must satisfy the partial Hamilton Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to solve the cost function in order to prove the optimality. In other words, the control design is derived from the CLF and inversely achieves optimality when the given cost function variables are determined posterior. All the stability of the closed loop system is ensured using the Lyapunov-based analysis.             In addition to structure stability, uncertainty/ disturbance presents a problem to a DNN in that it could degrade the system performance. Therefore, the DNN needs a robust control against uncertainty. Sliding mode control (SMC) is added to nominal control design based CLF in order to stabilize and counteract the effects of disturbance from uncertain DNN, also to achieve global asymptotic stability.  In the next section, a DNN observer is considered for estimating states of a class of controllable and observable nonlinear systems. A DNN observer-based adaptive inverse optimal control (AIOC) is needed. With weight adaptations, an adaptive technique is introduced in the observer design and its stabilizing control. The AIOC is designed to control a DNN observer and nonlinear system simultaneously while the weight parameters are updated online. This control scheme guarantees the quality of a DNN&#39;s state and minimizes the cost function.   	In addition, a tracking problem is investigated. An inverse optimal adaptive tracking control based on a DNN observer for unknown nonlinear systems is proposed. Within this framework, a time-varying desired trajectory is investigated, which generates a desired trajectory based on the external inputs. The tracking control design forces system states to follow the desired trajectory, while the DNN observer estimates the states and identifies unknown system dynamics. The stability method based on Lyapunov-based analysis is guaranteed a global asymptotic stability.   Numerical examples and simulation studies are presented and shown for each section to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>On the Computation of LFSR Characteristic Polynomials for One-Dimensional and Two-Dimensional Test Pattern Generation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Acevedo, Oscar</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Current methodologies for built-in test pattern generation usually employ a predetermined linear feedback shift register (LFSR) in order to generate or decompress deterministic test patterns. As a direct consequence, the test pattern computation and the fault coverage are constrained to the preselected architecture. Work has been done to determine desirable characteristics in the LFSR to be used. Also, work has been done in the use of these predefined architectures, in order to compact the test data. In general, these methodologies take advantage of the large amount of don&#39;t care bits present in the test patterns, to accommodate the few specified bits to the output generated by the predefined LFSR. This dissertation explores the design of the LFSR as a built-in mechanism for test pattern generation in integrated circuits. The advantage of designing such devices is that the test set generation process is not constrained to a predefined LFSR mechanism, and the fault coverage is not affected. The methodologies presented in this work are based on cryptography concepts and heuristics to perform its computation. First, it is shown how these concepts can be adapted to test pattern generation. After this, methodologies are presented to generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional test sets. For the case of two-dimensional test set, the design of phase shifters is included.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>CLASSIFICATION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL AND TWO-DIMENSIONAL SIGNALS</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kanneganti, Raghuveer</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This dissertation focuses on the classification of one-dimensional and two-dimensional signals. The one-dimensional signal classification problem involves the classification of brain signals for identifying the emotional responses of human subjects under given drug conditions.  A strategy is developed to accurately classify ERPs in order to identify human emotions based on brain reactivity to emotional, neutral, and cigarette-related stimuli in smokers.  A multichannel spatio-temporal model is employed to overcome the curse of dimensionality that plagues the design of parametric multivariate classifiers for multi-channel ERPs. The strategy is tested on the ERPs of 156 smokers who participated in a smoking cessation program.  One half of the subjects were given nicotine patches and the other half were given placebo patches.  ERPs were collected from 29 channel in response to the presentation of the pictures with emotional (pleasant and unpleasant), neutral/boring, and cigarette-related content.  It is shown that human emotions can be classified accurately and the results also show that smoking cessation causes a drop in the classification accuracies of emotions in the placebo group, but not in the nicotine patch group.  Given that individual brain patterns were compared with group average brain patterns, the findings support the view that individuals tend to have similar brain reactions to different types of emotional stimuli. Overall, this new classification approach to identify differential brain responses to different emotional types could lead to new knowledge concerning brain mechanisms associated with emotions common to most or all people.  This novel classification technique for identifying emotions in the present study suggests that smoking cessation without nicotine replacement results in poorer differentiation of brain responses to different emotional stimuli.  Future, directions in this area would be to use these methods to assess individual differences in responses to emotional stimuli and to different drug treatments.  Advantages of this and other brain-based assessment include temporal precision (e.g, 400-800 ms post stimulus), and the elimination of biases related to self-report measures. The two-dimensional signal classification problems include the detection of graphite in testing documents and the detection of fraudulent bubbles in test sheets.  A strategy is developed to detect graphite responses in optical mark recognition (OMR) documents using inexpensive visible light scanners.  The main challenge in the formulation of the strategy is that the detection should be invariant to the numerous background colors and artwork in typical optical mark recognition documents. A test document is modeled as a superposition of a graphite response image and a background image.  The background image in turn is modeled as superposition of screening artwork, lines, and machine text components.  A sequence of image processing operations and a pattern recognition algorithm are developed to estimate the graphite response image from a test document by systematically removing the components of the background image.  The proposed strategy is tested on a wide range of scanned documents and it is shown that the estimated graphite response images are visually similar to those scanned by very expensive infra-red scanners currently employed for optical mark recognition.  The robustness of the detection strategy is also demonstrated by testing a large number of simulated test documents. A procedure is also developed to autonomously determine if cheating has occurred by detecting the presence of aberrant responses in scanned OMR test books.  The challenges introduced by the significant imbalance in the numbers of typical and aberrant bubbles were identified.  The aberrant bubble detection problem is formulated as an outlier detection problem.  A feature based outlier detection procedure in conjunction with a one-class SVM classifier is developed.  A multi-criteria rank-of-rank-sum technique is introduced to rank and select a subset of features from a pool of candidate features.  Using the data set of 11 individuals, it is shown that a detection accuracy of over 90% is possible.  Experiments conducted on three real test books flagged for suspected cheating showed that the proposed strategy has the potential to be deployed in practice.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this research an approach to all optical delta sigma modulator (ADSM) has been elaborated.  Two important components of ADSM; &#34;leaky integrator&#34; and &#34;inverted bi-stable quantizer&#34; were modeled, on the basis of cross gain modulation of the Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA). The simulations (via VPI photonics) were all in micrometer scale (suitable for chip fabrication). By simulating each element of ADSM the whole circuit was simulated and results have been showed and analyzed. By investigating the ADSM, the limiting factor for reaching higher frequencies (THz) was recognized to be the quantization device. Thus a new optical switch was introduced, for the first time so called &#34;proteresis.&#34; By applying proteretic bi-stable device in the delta sigma modulator, the resonance frequency was improved minimum two fold from 295MHz to 575MHz without making any change in hysteretic bi-stable switch.  The broad impact of this research is on the digital technologies that can be utilized in high-speed signal processing.  The prime examples are the RF technologies used in military and civilian applications. Furthermore introduction of proteresis opens a new research gate for compensating delay in almost every system.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Chronic Impact Of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles On Solanum Lycopersicum L. And Brassica Rapa L.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Qiang</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles (CeO2-NPs) are commonly used in polishing, engine enhancement agents and many other commercial products. Increased applications and accidental release have raised concerns on the potential impact of CeO2-NPs on the environment. Most previous studies focused on the short term effect of CeO2-NPs. Information is severely lacking on the long-term impact of CeO2-NPs at environmentally relevant concentrations. The main goal of the current dissertation was to investigate the chronic phytotoxicity of CeO2-NPs on two plant species, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and Turnip mustard (Brassica rapa L.) fast growing variety, and the physiological and biochemical responses of these two plant species to CeO2-NPs. Four specific objectives were established. The first objective was to investigate the effects of combined CeO2-NPs and TiO2-NPs exposure on tomato plant growth and oxidative stress. The second objective was to investigate the impact of a lifecycle exposure to CeO2-NPs on wild type tomato growth and fruit yield and to evaluate the transgenerational effects of CeO2-NPs exposure on plant growth and the oxidative stress of the second generation tomato seedlings. The third objective was to compare the influence of CeO2-NPs and bulk CeO2 particles on plant growth and oxidative stress of standard fast growing Brassica rapa. The final objective was to evaluate the risks of CeO2-NPs exposure over three generations on Brassica plant growth, oxidative stress and reproduction. The results suggested that firstly, CeO2-NPs pre-exposure at concentrations of 4 and 40 mg/kg dry soil followed by 1000 mg/L of TiO2-NPs post-treatment increased H2O2 content and antioxidant proteins activities compared with CeO2-NPs alone and TiO2-NPs alone, and reduced biomass of the tomato plants compared with CeO2-NPs alone. Secondly, irrigation of CeO2-NPs at concentrations up to 10 mg/L stimulated wild type tomato plant growth, but exposure to CeO2-NPs over a lifecycle harmed plant growth and induced higher H2O2 content in tomato seedlings of the second generation. Thirdly, bulk CeO2 exposure at irrigation concentrations of 10, and 100 mg/L were more beneficial for Brassica rapa plant growth than CeO2-NPs at equivalent concentrations. CeO2-NPs irrigation at 10 and 100 mg/L increased H2O2 content and antioxidant proteins activities than bulk CeO2 at equivalent concentrations. However, the mustard plants treated by CeO2-NPs or bulk CeO2 showed changes of H2O2 content in different growth stages, which illustrated that CeO2-NPs and the bulk counterpart induced the change of H2O2 content differently. Finally, irrigating mustard plants with 10 to 1000 mg/L CeO2-NPs over three generations resulted in an inhibited plant growth, stronger oxidative stress, less seed yield and poorer reproduction of offspring plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the chronic (multigenerational) effects of CeO2-NPs on plant growth and oxidative stress of tomato and mustard plants grown in soil.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>ARAB STUDENTS&#39; DIFFICULTIES WITH ENGLISH WRITING DURING THEIR TRANSITION TO THE UNITED STATES: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zghyer, Rima Nassar</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Many research studies have been conducted in Arab countries to examine the difficulties that Arab students encounter in learning English writing. Unfortunately, not much of that scholarship deals with the challenges that these second language learners face when they pursue degrees abroad. Furthermore, the earlier studies failed to include the students&#39; views about their difficulties, the causes, and possible solutions.  In an effort to fill the gap in our understanding of the problems Arab students face in learning to write in English, this study explores the experiences and perceptions of a sampling of forty Arab students who chose to study in the United States.  The students who participated provide firsthand information about their experiences in distinctly different learning and cultural environments; they provide information about their difficulties in improving their English writing skills and offer suggestions for all who teach writing to second language learners. The difficulties identified and described by these students provide a sketch of experiences and perceptions of Arab students who learn English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in their home countries and English as a Second Language (ESL) in the United States.  The information provided as a result of this study will guide future research on second language learners, help develop pedagogies that will better serve the students, and expand our understanding of language acquisition as it pertains to an increasingly multilingual world.</dc:description>
