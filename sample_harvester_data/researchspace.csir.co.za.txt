Up until now, the transport behaviour of these resistors has not been investigated. Such an investigation is of importance for carrying out comparisons that are close to the level of a direct comparison of two QHE apparatuses. A set of five 100-Omega resistors from three different manufacturers has been sent to 11 participating national metrological institutes. All laboratories but one has measured the resistors based on their laboratory's quantized Hall resistance measurements. A constant drift model has been applied, and the results are evaluated in such a way that the transport properties of these resistors are treated independently for the different types of resistor. Under certain conditions, these resistors allow comparisons with uncertainties better than 1 part in 10(8).</dc:description><dc:publisher>Institute of Electrical Electronics Engineers Inc</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:13:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:13:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:41Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2001-04</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>54204 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Schumacher, B, et al. 2001.

The surface complexation properties of a synthetic MnO2, delta -MnO2, have accordingly been investigated using glass electrode potentiometry. Experimental data were interpreted according to the surface complexation model in conjunction with the diffuse double layer model of the solid/solution interface. Adsorption constants were determined using the non-linear optimisation program FITEQL. Surface complexation parameters determined in this way were validated against results obtained from the literature. Best fits of alkalimetric titration data were obtained with a 2-site, 3 surface-species model of the delta -MnO2 surface. Site concentrations of 2.23 x 10(-3) mol g (-1) and 7.66 x 10(-4) mol g (-1) were obtained. Corresponding logarithms of formation constants for the postulated surface species are -1.27 (=XO-), -5.99 (=YO-) and 3.52 (=YOH2+) at I = 0.1 M. The surface speciation of delta -MnO2 is dominated by =XO- over the pit range investigated. Metal adsorption was modelled with surface species of the type =XOM+, =XOMOH, =YOM+, =YOMOH (M = Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb) and =XOM2OH2+ (M = Pb). For Cu, Ni and Zn, titration data could be modelled with =XOM+, =XOMOH, =YOM+ and =YOMOH, whereas for Cd, =XOM+ and =YOM+ were sufficient. Lead data were best modelled by assuming the dinuclear species =XOM2OH2+ to be the only surface species to form. Adsorption constants determined for Ni, Cu and Zn follow the Irving-Williams sequence. The model suggests an adsorption order of (Pb, Cu) &gt; (Ni, Zn) &gt; Cd. The discrepancy between model predictions and published adsorption results is similar to the variability observed in experimental results from different laboratories.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:36:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:36:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:43Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2001-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>388868 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Pretorius, PJ and  Linder, PW. 2001.

These variations in the host rock type have been classified into six main geotechnical areas. Knowledge of the difference in seismicity related to these geotechnical areas could influence the design of deep level stopes and optimise the support systems. In this study, the total seismicity was evaluated using the relationship between the cumulative seismic moment and volume of convergence. 300,000 seismic events occurred at various mining areas. The seismicity generated in areas with different mining conditions and geology has been compared. Special attention was paid to evaluate the difference in seismicity associated with different geotechnical classifications. The following variations were found; geotechnical areas with soft lava hangingwall and quartzite-conglomerate footwall are less active than the geotechnical areas with hard lava hangingwall and quartzite-conglomerate footwall. Geotechnical areas with soft lava hangingwall and Jeppestown Shale footwall are less active than geotechnical areas with soft lava hangingwall and quartzite-conglomerate footwall. However geotechnical areas with hard lava hangingwall and quartzite-conglomerate footwall and hard lava hangingwall and Booysen's Shale footwall at Western Deep Levels-South Mine do not indicate differences in the associated seismicity. Variations in the properties of the different types of quartzite forming the footwall at Deelkraal, Elandsrand, Mponeng, East Driefontein and Kloof Gold Mines do not appear to influence the level of seismicity</dc:description><dc:publisher>Birkhauser Verlag AG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:58:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:58:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>376532 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Milev, AM and Spottiswoode, SM. 2002.

It is an area with relatively similar deep Aeolian soils, and a strong south to north gradient in rainfall, from 200 to 1000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP) in the region studied. This provides an excellent basis for gradient studies at the sub continental scale. This paper briefly reviews the literature on the vegetation of the Kalahari and describes the vegetation structure and composition at 11 new sites. There is a clear gradient in woody plant biomass (as indexed by basal area) from south to north. Above the minimum level of 200 mm MAP, the woody basal area increases at a rate of ca. 2.5 m2.ha (-1) per 100 mm MAP. Mean maximum tree height also increases along the gradient, reaching 20 in at ca. 800 mm MAP. The number of species to contribute &gt; 95% of the woody basal area increases from one at 200 mm to 16 at 1000 mm MAP. Members of the Mimosaceae (mainly Acacia) dominate the tree layer up to 400 mm MAP. They are replaced by either the Combretaceae (Combretum or Terminalia) or Colophospermum mopane of the Caesalpinaceae between 400 and 600 mm MAP, and by other representatives of the Caesalpinaceae above 600 mm MAP. The vegetation is largely deciduous up to 1000 mm MAP, except for species that apparently have access to groundwater, which may be locally dominant above about 600 mm MAP.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Opulus Press Uppsala</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-26T07:11:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-26T07:11:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:47Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2002-06</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>199554 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Scholes, RJ, et al. 2002.

The excavation furthermore yielded good indications that a portion of an older breccia has been eroded and that fauna and artefacts from this older, reworked breccia have been redeposited within the younger deposit.

This pervasive open-system behaviour has been attributed to sustained hydrothermal circulation driven by the high heat productivity of the Bushveld granites. New Sr and Pb isotopic data are presented for basaltic to rhyolitic volcanics from the Rooiberg Group of the Transvaal Sequence in the Dullstroom-Loskop Dam area of the eastern Transvaal. These data show little evidence of open-system behaviour after about 1950 Ma and many sample suites retain ages which could reflect the formation of the Rooiberg Group i.e. older than 2070 Ma. It is argued that this preservation is due to the absence of fractionated, fluid/vapour-rich Bushveld granites in the immediate vicinity of the volcanic occurrences. Rooiberg Group volcanics with extensively perturbed Rb-Sr and particularly Pb-Pb isotopic systems reflect the action of granite-derived hydrothermal fluids. As a consequence, the isotope systematics in these volcanics could prove a useful exploration tool for sites of granite-derived metal deposits.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer Verlag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-28T07:58:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-28T07:58:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:50Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1995-04</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>818083 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Harmer, RE and Farrow, D. 1995.

The solid angles were derived from a single energy conformer in a geometry constrained in a prototypical metal environment that is with the ligand attached to Cr(co)(5). This choice permits comparison with recent ligand repulsive energies E(R). Correlations between Omega, E(R) and theta for the range of ligands studied typically gave correlation coefficients greater than 0.8. The values of the weighted average solid angle &lt;(Omega)over bar&gt;, have also been determined. The minimum conformer solid angle values are correlated with the weighted average solid angle (r = 0.96), suggesting that the minimum-energy conformation is a good approximate measure of steric size. Problems recognized in the definition of weighted mean cone angles have been overcome with the solid angle methodology. The method proposed is sufficiently general to be applied to any system which can be modelled by molecular mechanics methods.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science SA</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:51:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:51:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:51Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1995-06-14</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>750125 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>White, D, et al. 1995.

SIR-spheres are radiopharmaceutical products that are comprised of 90Y microspheres suspended in sterile, pyrogen-free water for injection into patients. It is necessary to establish for the SIR-spheres production the capability of accurately measuring the activity of this product to a traceable national measurement standard. In the SIR-spheres product, the microspheres are non-biodegradable plastic beads, which have a density of 1.0 g/ml and a diameter of approximately 35 mm. 90Y used was the nuclear reactor-produced radionuclide. The concentration of the microspheres is approximately 40% and patient doses of SIR- product are usually prepared in a Wheaton vial by ARI with an activity of 3 GBq in a volume of 5 ml. The direct standard transfer is limited to a small quantity of SIR-spheres of about 1ml due to the difficulty of effectively digesting a large quantity of SIR-spheres such as 5 ml. The calibration factor for 5ml SIR-spheres may be derived from the factor for 1ml SIR-spheres, although relatively large uncertainty may be introduced due to the inhomogeneity of activity concentration dispensed into 1 and 5ml samples.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-07T06:06:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-07T06:06:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:52Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2005-08</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>226672 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Mo, L, et al. 2005.

Many secondary sandstone-type uranium deposits have been formed when soluble U has precipitated after encountering reducing conditions in the subsurface. In the groundwater of the Uitenhage Aquifer (Cape Province, South Africa), U-238-series isotopes were used to assist in studying the history of the reducing barrier. Uranium isotopes were used to determine the present position of the barrier. Radium and radon were used to evaluate the path of migration that the front of the oxygen depletion zone has taken over the past 10 years. During this time the reducing barrier has moved, leaving in its wake a trail of U in various stages of secular equilibrium with its daughter Th-230. The Ra-226 daughter of Th-230 is not very mobile. Its growth upon the aquifer wall is reflected in the Rn content of the water. This in turn, due to the relatively great age of the water, indicates the extent of the Th-230 in growth from precipitated U that took place before the barrier migrated. Though economic uranium concentrations were not encountered in this study, the investigation serves to demonstrate the importance of investigating not only the present redox conditions as it pertains to U deposition, but the need to understand the past position of the uranium precipitation front. These are revealed by a combined study of the soluble uranium, radium and radon, combined with knowledge of the rate of groundwater flow.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-07T06:02:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-07T06:02:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:53Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1999-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>695793 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Vogel, JC, et al. 1999.

The effective concentration is taken to be the concentration of the liquidus minimum for the relevant binary system. Using this model, the anomalous and contradictory results for initial formation of titanium silicide phases are ascribed to the two eutectics at 14 and 84 at.% silicon (both at 1330 degrees C) for the Ti-Si binary system. The native oxide layer usually present on silicon surfaces and the affinity of Ti for oxygen further affect the effective concentration, thereby adding to the contradictory experimental results that have been found. In the Ni-Si system our measurements show that a sufficiently high concentration of oxygen in amorphous silicon can lead to formation of NiSi instead of Ni2Si, which is normally the first phase to form. This observation, as well as the formation of NiSi2 as the first phase in the presence of diffusion barriers, is also explained in terms of the effective heat of formation model.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science SA Lausanne</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:30:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:30:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:54Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1993-11</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>957990 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Pretorius, R, et al. 1993.

Application of the conventional SAR procedure (but with a range of pre-heat temperatures) to naturally irradiated quartz grains from two different archaeological sites in South Africa showed substantial changes in sensitivity through the measurement cycles; one sample (SIB2) showed no trend in D-e as a function of pre-heat temperature, showing that the sensitivity correction was appropriate, whereas for the other sample (ZB4) there was a trend that could be related to the growth curve construction, rather than measurement of the natural signal. However, application of a conventional SAR procedure, with a 260 degrees C preheat for 10s and a cut heat at 160 degrees C, to quartz grains that had been bleached and given a laboratory dose, resulted in underestimation of the dose by grater of equal to 10%. The effect of raising the cut heat temperature from 160 degrees C was investigated using LM-OSL measurements in order to identify OSL components that are present in addition to the fast component for which SAR was developed. The effects of changing the cut heat temperature and adding a high-temperature optical stimulation between cycles in the SAR procedure were measured for dose recovery tests. The effects of these changes on measurement of D-e values for single aliquots of these two samples are reported. Both modifications improved D-e recovery, and the study emphasizes the importance of carrying out dose recovery tests.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-20T12:26:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-20T12:26:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-05</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>905984 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Jacobs, Z, Wintle, AG and Duller, GAT. 2006.

The cobalt content of the alloys ranged from 10 to 24 vol% and the grain size from 0.5 to 2.3 um. It was found that, at all cobalt contents and all temperatures, the decrease in hardness with increasing grain size can be approximated by a Hall-Fetch type relationship. Up to about 600 degrees C the decrease in hardness with increasing temperature appears to be due mostly to the decrease in the intrinsic hardness of the individual phases. Above 600 degrees C the decrease in hardness appears to be due mostly to easier slip transfer across grain boundaries.

The advantage of using (LS) counting in the 4p channel is that self-absorption does not occur, leading to Auger electrons being detected with relatively high efficiency; I-125, Ir-192 and Zn-65 were measured as part of international key comparisons held under the auspices of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The Ce-139 measurements formed part of a regional comparison organized by the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP). Since Ce-139 decays simply by electron-capture to the 166 keV excited state of 139La. This state de-excites through the emission of conversion electrons and g-rays. The detection efficiency analysis is based on a counting source being viewed by two phototubes in coincidence, with a single NaI(Tl) crystal detecting the g-rays this technique is a viable technique for the absolute activity measurement of electron-capture-based radionuclides. The efficiency data can generally be fitted with a linear  function, particularly in the high-efficiency region, or by a low-order polynomial expression, giving rise to reliable extrapolated activity values. However the application of the method to 125I is more difficult due to the requirement of a proper background correction to the sum peak area. It is surmised that a NaI detector with improved resolution that better separates the sum peak will reduce the discrepancy observed in the more recent activity measurement</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-07T06:01:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-07T06:01:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:01:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-10</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>164754 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Van Wyngaardt, WM and Simpson, BRS. 2006.

During the course of the work presented in this series, accumulations of such radionuclides have been studied at austenitic stainless steel type 08X18H10T (GOST 5632-61) surfaces (this austenitic stainless steel corresponds to AISI 321). Comparative experiments have been performed on magnetite-covered carbon steel (both materials are frequently used in some Soviet VVER type PWRs). For these laboratory-scale investigations a combination of the in situ radiotracer `thin gap' method and voltammetry is considered to be a powerful tool due to its high sensitivity towards the detection of the submonolayer coverage of corrosion product radionuclides. An independent technique (XPS) is also used to characterize the depth distribution and chemical state of various contaminants in the passive layer formed on austenitic stainless steel. In the first part of the series the accumulation of 110mAg has been investigated. Potential dependent sorption of Ag+. ions (cementation) is found to be the predominant process on austenitic steel, while in the case of magnetite-covered carbon steel the silver species are mainly depleted in the form of Ag2O. The XPS depth profile of Ag gives evidence about the embedding of metallic silver into the entire passive layer of the austenitic stainless steel studied.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-17T09:13:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-17T09:13:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999-03-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>404621 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Hirschberg, J, et al. 1999.

According to the design of the programme, monitoring sites had to be selected in order to assess the status and trends of faecal pollution. Issues of efficiency and cost-effectiveness dictated that the monitoring would focus on areas with the greatest risk. A method based on relevant land and water use information (e.g. level of water supply and sanitation, agricultural practices, surface runoff, recreation) was developed for the selection and prioritization of these areas. A measurement scale was described for all sensitive uses to ensure the objectivity of the selection process. For the prioritization purposes, weights were assigned to the different uses according to their impact. This was done by means of the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART). The method was found to be useful for the identification of high-risk areas but the availability and reliability of the data are some of the major constraints.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-26T08:55:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-26T08:55:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:01Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>282572 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Venter, SN, Kuhn, AL and Harris, J. 1998.

Such corrosion results in the thinning of the pipeline walls, reduction in the mechanical strength due to this thinning and finally possible failure of the pipeline. The integrity of older pipelines can be investigated by conducting a series of tests on the pipeline, both destructive and non-destructive, to determine the condition of coating and lining of the pipe line, the mechanical properties, and the extent of the thinning of the pipe walls. The results of these tests are used to determine whether refurbishment or replacement of the pipeline is the most viable option.

The region is underlain by a homogeneous soil substrate, the Kalahari sands, and provides the opportunity to analyze climate effects on nutrient cycling. Soil and plant N pools, N-15 natural abundance (delta(15)N), and soil NO (Nitric oxide) emissions were measured to indicate patterns of N cycling along a precipitation gradient. The importance of biogenic N-2 fixation associated with vascular plants was estimated with foliar delta(15)N and the basal area of leguminous plants. Soil and plant N was more N-15 enriched in arid than in humid areas, and the relation was steeper in samples collected during wet than during dry years. This indicates a strong effect of annual precipitation variability on N cycling. Soil organic carbon and C/N decreased with aridity, and soil N was influenced by plant functional types. Biogenic N-2 fixation associated with vascular plants was more important in humid areas. Nitrogen fixation associated with trees and shrubs was almost absent in arid areas, even though Mimosoideae species dominate. Soil NO emissions increased with temperature and moisture and were therefore estimated to be lower in drier areas. The isotopic pattern observed in the Kalahari (N-15 enrichment with aridity) agrees with the lower soil organic matter, soil C/N, and N-2 fixation found in arid areas. However, the estimated NO emissions would cause an opposite pattern in delta(15)N, suggesting that other processes, such as internal recycling and ammonia volatilization, may also affect isotopic signatures. This study indicates that spatial, and mainly temporal, variability of precipitation play a key role on N cycling and isotopic signatures in the soil-plant system.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-16T07:24:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-16T07:24:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:03Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2004-03</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>242068 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Aranibar, JN, et al. 2004.

In this paper, representative Land sat path-row scene locations, distributed over southern Africa, were used to quantify the area burned arid to understand the coupled role of the timing and the extent of burning on regional emissions. The total area burned and the scar size distribution were found to vary between semi-arid and humid scenes and dry and average rainfall years: Analysis of images from the start and end of the burning season resulted in a modest underestimate of the annual area burned, as compared to using a monthly time-series approach. However, at the regional level the start/end method is likely to yield acceptable annual burned area estimates and total carbon dioxide estimates. On the other hand, combustion factors and emission factors vary sufficiently during the burning season to result in large errors in emission estimates of products of incomplete combustion, when using the start/end method. This study indicates that in southern Africa, the timing in addition to the extent of burning must be considered and that time-series satellite burned area products are needed to quantify pyrogenic emissions accurately.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science Ltd.</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-07T13:32:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-07T13:32:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:04Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2003-06</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>477387 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Korontzi, S, Justice, CO and Scholes, RJ. 2003.

Different definitions of episode were applied to these data to assess their effect on annualized diarrheal morbidity. Adjustment factors were then derived that corrected morbidity for non-standard definitions of episode. Applying non-standard definitions of episode gave estimates of an annualized number of episodes between 38% and 137% of the internationally accepted definition.

A number of practical examples of bearing failure have been used to illustrate the various types of contact fatigue damage.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-26T11:30:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-26T11:30:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:07Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1997-06</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>946406 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Fernandes, PJL. 1997.

This paper presents the results of three catchment experiments, analysed by the paired catchment method that aimed to provide a quantitative evaluation of the water yield savings attributable to this practice. These experiments show conclusively that, for South African conditions, riparian vegetation is a more liberal user of water than vegetation in other parts of a catchment and that the clearing of indigenous forest or exotic trees in the riparian zone of the catchment will result in disproportionately greater gains in water yield than would result from clearing similar vegetation elsewhere in the catchment. First year flow increases from clearing of tall woody vegetation in the riparian zone ranged from 55 to 110 mm (9-44%) per 10% of catchment cleared. In the same catchments, clearing of similar vegetation in upslope (no riparian positions) led to flow increases ranging from 27 to 35 mm (2.5-14%) per 10% of catchment cleared.</dc:description><dc:publisher>National Research Council Canada</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T12:26:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T12:26:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:09Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1999-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1837888 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Scott, DF. 1999.

It can take the form of fundamental vegetation cover transformation, or of intensification of existing land use without substantial change in cover type. Atmospheric composition changes and resultant climate changes could become ecologically significant within the next century. Changes in atmospheric composition in the tropics are essentially the same as those in higher latitudes, despite differences in the source and sink strengths for trace gases. Such changes can affect the functioning of tropical ecosystems through several processes, principally those related to carbon and nutrient assimilation and their interactions. Atmospheric composition may also have an indirect affect on tropical ecosystems via its effects on the climate. Predicted temperature increases in the tropics are less extreme than at high latitudes, but could still be biologically significant, especially at the tropical margins. The structure and productivity of ecosystems of the sub humid and dry tropics are very sensitive to changes in water balance, which could be caused by a combination of changes in precipitation and temperature. It is presently not possible to predict rainfall changes at ecologically meaningful scales with any confidence.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:10:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:10:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997-09</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1283623 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Scholes, RJ and Van Breemen, N. 1997.

There was substantial variation in the leaf area estimated within each site, using the same sample frame, but different measurement techniques. The trends in canopy properties in relation to the aridity gradient were consistent, regardless of the technique used for estimating the properties. The effective plant area index for the tree canopy (the sum of the stem area index and the leaf area index (LAI)) declined from around 2 to around 0.8 m(2) m(-2) over a gradient of mean annual rainfall from 1000 to 350 mm. Stems contributed 2-5% of the tree canopy plant area index. Since the tree canopy cover decreased from 50% to 20% over this aridity range, the leaf area index within the area covered by tree canopies remained fairly constant at 3-4 m(2) m(-2). Tree leaves tended from a horizontal orientation to a more random orientation as the aridity increased. On the same gradient, the leaf minor axis dimension decreased from around 30 mm to around 3 mm, and the mean specific leaf area decreased from 14 to 5 m(2) kg ha(-1). There was good agreement between LAI observed in the field using a line ceptometer and the LAI inferred by the MODIS sensor on the Terra satellite platform, 2 months later in the same season.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-26T07:14:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-26T07:14:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004-03</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>150906 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Scholes, RJ, Frost, PGH and Tian, Y. 2004.

Biological invasions are driven by human activities and mediated by culturally shaped values and ethics. This paper explores the human dimensions of alien plant invasions in South Africa. We consider four primary forces, those which directly influence the likelihood and rate of invasion - arrival of propagules; changes in disturbance regimes; changes in the availability of limiting factors; and fragmentation of the landscape - and the roles of 22 secondary driving forces in shaping the outcomes of the four primary driving forces. Human societies and their dynamics and activities are an integral part of each of the secondary driving forces. A map of the interactions between and among the primary and secondary driving forces shows how they are interlinked and influence each other-either positively or negatively, or switching between the two. There are two key points for intervention: prevention of the introduction of propagules of potentially invasive species and developing collaborative initiatives with enterprises that rely largely on alien species (for example, horticulture, agriculture and forestry, including community forestry) to minimize the introduction and use of potentially invasive species. An example of the first type of intervention would be to implement more effective inspection systems at international border and customs posts. This type of intervention can only be effective if those who are directly affected-whether businessmen, tourists or migrants - understand the requirement for these measures, and collaborate. The need to build public awareness of the critical importance of the human dimension of invasions emerges as a key theme from this analysis and is the basis for better-informed decisions, more effective control programmes and a reduction of further invasions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Acad Science South Africa A S S AF</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-28T06:32:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-28T06:32:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:12Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2004-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>387285 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Le Maitre, DC, Richardson, DM and Chapman, RA. 2004.

A new burn severity index was derived that is shown to map three categories of burn severity on three experimental burn plots in the southern Kruger National Park, South Africa. Those pixels which corresponded to a greater abundance of white ash were found to be significantly related to the pre-burn above-ground fuel biomass and an indicator of burn efficiency. Landsat ETM+ combustion completeness was most significantly related to the abundance of post-burn residual, non-photosynthetic fuel biomass. For the same reflectance change in pre- and post-fire imagery, a greater magnitude of fire severity was measured on corresponding ETM+ pixels. This implies that fire severity depends more on the colour of the ash than on the magnitude of change in reflectance. Burned area mapping methods that rely on reflectance change in multi-temporal imagery may not reliably characterize burn effects such as fire severity and efficiency in semi-arid savannas.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Academy of Science of South Africa</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-28T08:32:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-28T08:32:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1405372 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Landmann, T. 2003.

This has caused some dissatisfaction where the species concerned also have useful characteristics, and stakeholders contend that some of these useful species are not invasive. A rapid assessment of the invasive status of Eucalyptus species at 82 sites in South Africa (54 in the Western Cape and 28 in Mpumalanga) indicated that only Red River gum (E. camaidutensis) and flooded gum (E. grandis) are clearly invasive. Surveys were not undertaken in parts of the Western Cape known to be invaded by spider gum (E. lehmannii); the invasive status of this species is well known and is not contested. Red River gum has transformed long stretches of rivers and its importance as a major weed has been underestimated in previous reviews of alien plant invasions in South Africa. Most other species were naturalized. The authors recommend that projects aimed at clearing eucalypts should focus on riparian areas and nature reserves (where all eucalypts have deleterious effects), but that clearing projects outside these areas should only target species known to be invasive until such time as the invasive status of the other eucalypts (notably sugar gum, E. cladocalyx, and karri, E. diversicolor) can be ascertained with a greater degree of confidence.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Acad Science South Africa</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-04-02T08:29:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-04-02T08:29:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:14Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2004-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>799476 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Forsyth, GG, et al. 2004.

Modelled SO, concentrations on the central highveld mostly range between 10 and 50 ppb, exceeding 50 ppb in source areas. Dry deposition rates for sulphur exhibit a similar spatial pattern to the ambient SO2 concentrations and both are consistent with synoptic-scale transport patterns. Maximum dry deposition rates for sulphur of more than 10 kg S ha(-1)a(-1) occur over the central highveld with a well-defined gradient decreasing away from the source region. Despite the significant differences in modelling approaches, the estimates of dry deposition provided by MATCH are in reasonable agreement with those of the inferential model. The maximum modelled wet deposition rates occur over the South African highveld and its periphery and range between 1 and 5 kg S ha(-1)a(-1) and compare favourably with measurements from an acid rain network. Wet deposition generally exceeds dry deposition on the highveld and the adjacent areas except in the central highveld source region. Over the drier western half of South Africa MATCH-modelled dry and wet deposition rates are again similar and are less that 1 kg S ha(-1)a(-1). Wet deposition exceeds dry in the higher rainfall regions along the south and east coasts of South Africa.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:19:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:19:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:16Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1052532 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Zunckel, M, et al. 2000.

In the northern hemisphere, ecologists from countries subscribing to the International Mussel Watch have used toxin-mediated changes in the organs of Mytilus edulis, especially in the morphology of gill filaments, to indicate the biotoxicity of marine effluent. M. edulis is not indigenous to South African Waters. For us to adopt a similar approach on the South African east coast, it is necessary to catalogue both the normal appearance and toxin-mediated changes in our local brown mussel Perna perna. In this study, the gill filaments from five healthy, adult brown mussels were studied by light and transmission electron microscopy. Special attention was paid to filament architecture, enervation of filaments, number and type of cells populating filament epithelia and variations in epithelial cell morphotogy and cilia ultra structure. Filament shape was maintained by thickened chitin and strategically placed smooth myocytes. The epithelium was populated with eight morphologically distinctive non-secretory, mucus secreting or sensory cell types in various stages of differentiation. Unmyelinated nerves were situated beneath six cell types. Significant differences in filament architecture and epithelial cell morphology were found between M. edulis and P. perna.

The influence of different parameters during the callus induction phase was examined with respect to the regeneration rate: (1) the concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and various cytokinins; (2) the addition of AgNO3; (3) the use of maltose or sucrose as a carbon source. Modifications in the phytohormones alone resulted in the regeneration of fertile sorghum plants at high efficiency. Significant increases in the regeneration rates of pearl millet genotypes were achieved by the combination of sucrose as a carbon source and silver nitrate as a potential ethylene inhibitor.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer-Verlag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:03:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:03:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:18Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2001-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>248276 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Oldach, KH, et al. 2001.

In light of the known health effects of kerosene usage, this study aimed to quantify the health risk for people living in a densely populated informal settlement known as Cato Crest within the Durban metropolitan area. The pollutants investigated included nitrogen dioxide, benzene and toluene. Nitrogen dioxide is known to affect both respiratory and immune systems, benzene is carcinogenic while toluene has a neurological health end point. All three pollutants are harmful when inhaled. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) health risk assessment (HRA) framework was applied. Information on the exposure patterns of residents in Cato Crest were acquired through questionnaires in which data on fuel use, building structure, cooking habits and time-activity patterns were collected. Air quality monitoring of nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds was also conducted in the households. The time-activity pattern survey revealed that the exposure periods of individuals in Cato Crest were far greater than the default exposure periods used by the US EPA. The results of the HRA showed that the residents of Cato Crest may experience significant health risks as a result of kerosene usage in their homes. Exposure to 1-h nitrogen dioxide concentration is not likely to produce adverse health effects, whereas exposure over a 24-h period indicates a potential health risk to sensitive individuals in two of the households when US EPA exposure values are used and in all of the households when locally derived exposure values are used. Benzene poses a health risk to sensitive individuals in 50% of the households when local exposure parameters are used, whereas there is no health risk associated with exposure to toluene.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T06:39:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T06:39:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:19Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2003-05</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>351231 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Muller, E, et al. 2003.

The relationships between delta (13) C and WUE calculated on the basis of leaf, harvestable stem, shoot and whole-plant dry mass accumulation were investigated. There was no clonal variation in dry mass accumulation but clonal allocation to roots, harvestable stems, branches and leaves varied. Water use efficiencies (mass of plant or plant part/water used over 16 months) differed significantly between clones. The clonal ranking of WUE varied depending on the units of dry mass accumulation used. Significant relationships between delta (13) C values and instantaneous water use efficiencies and ratios of internal leaf to ambient CO2 concentrations were found only in the high soil water treatment. There were no relationships between delta (13) C values and whole-plant, shoot and harvestable stem water use efficiencies and soil water availability. Values of delta (13) C were negatively correlated with dry mass accumulation in the low soil water treatment. At the whole-plant level, WUE was positively correlated with dry mass accumulation in the high soil water treatment.

A major challenge is to improve mine design methodology by identifying the geological features that are seismically active and then changing the direction of mining to reduce the potential for shear slip on these features. In this paper we classify seismic events with similar waveforms (doublets) into multiplets, relocate them simultaneously using arrival-time differences based on cross-correlations between all event pairs and then identify the orientation of the most likely plane on which the events are located. Identification of multiplets has been automated, even including events that have not previously been located. In contrast to the conventional 'master' event method, no single master event is used: each event is a 'master' event for each other event. The absolute location of each multiplet is stabilised by using all manually selected arrival times. Vectors are drawn between all pairs of events and Principal Component Analysis applied to obtain the orientation of the most likely plane of the events in each multiplet. We tested this method on seismic data recorded underground at a site in Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mine, South Africa, in which a strike stabilising pillar has been mined from one end with the aid of precondition blasting. We found that 39% of events that were previously located in a diffuse cloud within a mine pillar were formed into three distinct multiplets. Two multiplets were oriented parallel to directions of dominant mining-induced stresses, i.e., along the long axis of the pillar and parallel to the active mining face, and the third along a pervasive joint set.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:05:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:05:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:21Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1998-04-15</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1238744 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Spottiswoode, SM and Milev, AM. 1998.

The strategic management of technology-based assets is therefore crucial for these organisations as an imperative for business success. However, these assets are often intangible and reflect future rather than current value and are therefore difficult to manage when using traditional managerial concepts, This study investigates integrative mechanisms addressing the management of technology-based assets and offerings in a technology organisation, The approach taken was to study the views and practices regarding the management of technology-based assets in a number of strategic units of a technology organisation (CSIR, South Africa). The study maintains that the management of technology-based assets and offerings requires clear strategic management of the process of technological innovation with special emphasis on the management of the intellectual capital (IC) and the intellectual property (IP) of the organisation, The study describes a framework linking the core processes supporting the management of technology-based assets and offerings with other organisational elements such as leadership, strategy, and culture. Specific key links between the core process of innovation and the strategic management of investment in technology-based assets using a portfolio approach are discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-04-02T08:46:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-04-02T08:46:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:22Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2000-10</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>363907 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Kfir, R. 2000.

This paper reports on studies of four representative catchments (The Sonderend, Keurbooms, Upper-Wilge and Sabie-Sand) to assess the impacts and costs of invasions at a scale that is more relevant to managers. Several alien plant species have invaded the catchments. Non-riverine invasions are mainly Pinus and Hakea species in Sonderend and Keurbooms, eucalypts in the Upper Wilge, and pines and scramblers (e.g. Lantana camara) in the Sabie-Sand catchment. Riverine invasions are dominated by Acacia mearnsii and, to a lesser extent, A. dealbata, except in the Sabie-Sand and the lower Sonderend River where Eucalyptus species are important. The impacts and costs are significant and are comparable with those calculated independently for other South African catchments. Water is acknowledged to be a key constraint to economic growth in South Africa and there is considerable pressure for efficient and sustainable use of the limited water resources. The projected impacts would justify control programmes aimed at clearing alien invader, for water conservation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV.</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:02:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:02:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002-05-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>251606 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Le Maitre, DC, et al. 2002.

How the synthetic chemist gains access to such compounds forms the subject of this review. The synthesis of polysubstituted naphthalenes is often not simple by conventional electrophilic aromatic substitution owing to the important problem of regio chemical control. The current general de novo approaches to naphthalenes attempt to circumvent this problem, and include rearrangements and condensations in which the substitution pattern of the aromatic product is determined by the structure of the starting materials. This review, without attempting to be totally comprehensive, serves to illustrate the applications of these general methods and the variation thereof. The authors have also chosen to illustrate with representative examples mainly those methods that show the conversion of single ring benzene precursors into naphthalenes. Routes in which a pre-existing naphthalene core is modified are specifically excluded. Most of the material in this review covers the period from 1999 to the end of 2001, although common traditional methods for the synthesis of substituted naphthalenes will also be mentioned. Where deemed appropriate, some extensions to polycyclic aromatic compounds will also be included. While there is no general review on the synthesis of naphthalenes and naphthols, there are reviews on some aspects of the material covered in this review, which will be mentioned in the appropriate sections. Some partially related reviews covering benzannulation reactions have also recently been published.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-12T13:11:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-12T13:11:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:26Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2003-01-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>2270878 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>De Koning, CB, Rousseau, AL and  Van Otterlo, WAL. 2003.

The aim was to provide information on the formation of fractures around deep level mine tunnels under controlled conditions. Solid cubes containing a circular hole were confined to a vertical pressure of 200 MPa with a confinement of 100 MPa in the two horizontal directions. To provide a contrast, a block was made from a series of plates to simulate the presence of horizontal bedding planes. The resulting fracture patterns are completely different and emphasized that the amount of fracturing would be considerably increased as a result of discontinuities in the rock.  The tests confirmed that discontinuities in the rock mass can alter the fracture patterns associated with an excavation. The discontinuities induce more fracturing than is observed in the solid blocks. Thus, the extent of fracturing expected in deep level mining excavations will be greater than predicted from borehole breakout analyses. However analysis of acoustic emission data provides insights into the response of the rock during loading and unloading and assists with the identification of the effect of the discontinuities. A model based on Mohr Coulomb plasticity and rotating smeared-crack concepts has been developed to represent the formation of discrete fracture processes in a continuum under compressive and tensile stress conditions. The model is implemented in a discrete element - finite element method and is able to represent the change in fracture patterns between the solid and jointed blocks. This provides confidence for the application of the numerical model to the design of mine tunnels at great depth.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:54:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:54:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000-10</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>795468 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Sellers, EJ and Klerck, P. 2000.

This article attempts to provide a multi-dimensional framework within which a library and information service (L&amp;IS) could measure its performance. As prerequisite, for implementation of the stated framework, the L&amp;IS management (and staff) needed to understand that: measuring should be done for local development and progress using the L&amp;IS's mission and a strategy for a sustainable future as the focal areas; sustainability requires more than providing proof of spending the stakeholder's money wisely; and adding value for the customer in isolation also does not ensure sustainability. In order to be sustainable in the knowledge economy it is necessary to understand that the relationships between the human, structure, customer and stakeholder capitals are vital. The L&amp;IS sector would therefore, in the first instance, be required to ensure that customers could trust that they are receiving the services and products that maximise their own productivity and asset utilization. Secondly L&amp;IS stakeholders would need to be assured that they are receiving the best value for their investment. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, L&amp;IS staff would have to be assured that they have the necessary skills and resources to provide for a motivating environment and that the infrastructure created will ensure continuous improvement for all.</dc:description><dc:publisher>KG Saur Verlag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-14T08:08:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-14T08:08:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:28Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2004-03</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>78882 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Van Deventer, MJ and Snyman, RMMM. 2004.

Trends in ecosystem services (fresh water, food, fuel-wood, cultural and biodiversity) over the period 1990-2000 were mixed across scales. Freshwater resources appear strained across the continent with large numbers of people not securing adequate supplies, especially of good quality water. This translates to high infant mortality patterns across the region. In some areas, the use of water resources for irrigated agriculture and urban-industrial expansion is taking place at considerable cost to the quality and quantity of freshwater available to ecosystems and for domestic use. Staple cereal production across the region has increased but was outstripped by population growth while protein malnutrition is on the rise. The much-anticipated wood-fuel crisis on the subcontinent has not materialized but some areas are experiencing shortages while numerous others remain vulnerable. Cultural benefits of biodiversity are considerable, though hard to quantify or track over time. Biodiversity resources remain at reasonable levels, but are declining faster than reflected in species extinction rates and appear highly sensitive to land-use decisions. The SAfMA sub-global assessment provided an opportunity to experiment with innovative ways to assess ecosystem services including the use of supply-demand surfaces, service sources and sink areas, priority areas for service provision, service 'hotspots' and trade-off assessments.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Royal Society</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-14T08:09:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-14T08:09:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:29Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2005-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1968167 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Van Jaarsveld, et al. 2005.

The effect of wave propagation is usually not well known as only simplified models of geological structures are available. Therefore, the information about the source retrieved by inverting seismograms may include errors due to incomplete knowledge of the rock mass along the propagation path, which in turn cause a distortion in the calculated moment tensor (MT). The distortion of the MT on a local scale was observed by inverting records of a simulated rock burst conducted at the Kopanang gold mine in South Africa. A dominant isotropic component of the explosive characteristics was found from the inversion. The deviatoric components retrieved from the blast are spurious. A test of their stability indicated that they are not significant, assuming an uncertainty above 5% for velocities and 10% for attenuation within the homogeneous model available for the mine. Thus, the retrieval of the MT from records of local networks in mines using a homogeneous model of the rock mass seems to be feasible. However, the homogeneous model of the rock mass can only be applied to close stations, within a few kilometres of the source. The seismic records from distant stations were too complex to be modelled by a homogeneous rock mass. Records of six mine-induced seismic events recorded at the Kopanang gold mine were also inverted. A vertical linear dipole along the pressure (P) axis was found for three of the events, suggesting a pillar burst. The mechanism of two events contains an isotropic implosion together with a nearly vertical dip-slip, and seems to indicate a combination of a cavity collapse with a down dip-slip along a nearly vertical fault. One event corresponds to a dipole along the tensional (T) axis. However, it is vertical, thus its association with tensile faulting of the hanging wall is uncertain.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Birkhauser Verlag AG</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T09:32:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T09:32:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:31Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2006-08</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>710817 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Sileny, J and Milev, A. 2006.

The WRQMRA consisted of an observed-adverse-effect-level approach (OAELA) and a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The OAELA was based on the occurrence of E coli in the study waters to determine the possible risk of infection and the QMRA probable risk of infection by salmonellae. The WRQMRA was applied to recreational surface resource waters as well as waters from an unprotected spring and waters from the treated municipal supply that were stored in containers for domestic purposes. E. coli numbers were measured against expected infection levels expressed in water quality guidelines, while Salmonella counts were calculated to give the probable infection risk (P-I). Ingestion was based on intake volumes compiled for the various water uses. E coli occurred in numbers &lt;1 06 in the surface waters, while the untreated spring and treated supply water contained E Coliof &lt; 10(2) and &lt;10(1) respectively. Salmonella occurred in numbers of &lt;10(3) in recreational waters, and &lt;10(-1) in water used for domestic purposes. A single exposure to the mean (as well as 95th percentile) risk was calculated using a beta-Poisson dose-response model at ingestion volumes of 100 mL (for full-contact recreation) and 1,318 mL (for domestic water use). Both the OAELA and the QMRA approaches indicated a risk of infection to recreational and domestic water users, even for a single exposure event, with the OAELA either over- or under-estimating the risk of infection for singular exposure events. This indicated that this method, used on its own, could not reliably predict a realistic risk of infection. It is recommended that the full WRQMRA process be used, and further developed to address several uncertainties that became evident during this study.</dc:description><dc:publisher>International Water Association Publishing</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-14T07:16:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-14T07:16:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>487238 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Steyn, M, Jagals, P and Genthe, B. 2004.

Studies on effluents and surface waters showed that all the tests have a viable role to play in water quality management. The most advantageous use of the tests is in battery form, so that tests can complement each other. The fish and Daphnia lethality tests, and algal growth inhibition tests are recommended for regulatory and management purposes of effluents. If receiving water is used for drinking water purposes, the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity and toad embryo teratogenicity tests should be included in the battery of tests. Some of the rapid microbiotests, the petrozoan oxygen uptake tests, bacterial growth test and enzyme tests, could be valuable screening tools to identify and categorize toxic effluents.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-14T07:37:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-14T07:37:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:34Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1999-10</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>421057 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Slabbert, JL and Venter, EA. 1999.

An extensive scientific health risk assessment and epidemiological study to determine the actual health risks, is very expensive and requires medical and financial justification. The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical health risk model, which could be used as a predictive tool to determine as accurately as possible from the data available if a complete scientific health risk assessment study is justified. The actual amounts of pesticides sold in the Vaalharts area by two major pesticide manufacturers were used to perform a theoretical health risk assessment. The risks were assessed by making use of RISK*ASSISTANT, a computer modelling system and chemical database. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) health risk model was applied to the data to identify the hazards, assess the exposures and dose response, and characterize the risks. Three exposure scenarios, namely, the ingestion of food and water and the inhalation of air were evaluated. The method used to calculate the risks varied according to the type of health hazard and the results were characterized accordingly. The acute health effects due to exposure to pesticides are well known and the risks are easy to determine. However, the risks associated with chronic health hazards were more difficult to calculate. For this reason a ranking model was developed which made use of a point scoring system. This model highlights those pesticides which have the greatest possibility of causing chronic health effects. From the results it can be concluded that very large amounts of pesticides are used in the Vaalharts area and that the community might be at risk to chronic health effects. Although the theoretical health risk assessment model was successfully used in this study, its effectiveness as a predictive tool still has to be proven by a complete scientific study.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer Verlag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:24:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:24:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:34Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1997-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>114037 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Raschke, AM and Burger, AEC. 1997.

Samples were withdrawn periodically, the lipids extracted, purified, and analysed for free and esterified cholesterol. From the results of these tests the rates of the enzymatic esterification of cholesterol at the four temperatures were calculated. In the temperature range of -6 to 17 degrees C the rate increased with temperature. Application of an Arrhenius plot afforded the esterification rate at any temperature within the range examined. Enzymatic formation of cholesterol ester from free cholesterol has been shown to occur during spoilage of anchovy (Engraulis capensis). As a result, the quality of the oil produced from the fish is reduced, as esterified cholesterol is much more difficult to remove from the oil than free cholesterol. However enzymatic esterification of free cholesterol during spoilage of anchovy in the delay between catching and processing adversely affects the quality of the resulting anchovy oil since, in contrast to free cholesterol, esterified cholesterol is only removed with difficulty. This is a serious problem for anchovy rich oils, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and used as dietary supplements, since these oils should have little total cholesterol. The present investigation has shown that esterification is very temperature-dependent; for instance the rate at 17 degrees C is 16 times that at 0 degrees C. Icing the fish in the delay period is therefore very effective in reducing the progressive esterification of cholesterol.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Marcel Dekker</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-16T08:11:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-16T08:11:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:35Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2004-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>115208 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>De Koning, AJ. 2004.

An attempt was made to validate this correlation with Th/U dating. Unlike typical European peat, which is acidic, the soil pH of the Hula peat is mildly basic. Not only does this contribute to the oxidation of palynomorphs, but it also helps to preserve the carbonate material that can be a variable mixture of allogenic, endogenic, and authigenic components, each component may represent a different degree of uranium series disequilibrium. The thorium (Th-232) concentrations of the carbonate are low. Total digestion or acid leach of the sample may not always enable the proper correction for initial thorium. The dating derived from a NaOH-extraction of the organic material, while giving apparently better ages, also suffers from the presence of the carbonate admixture. It appears that, while C-14 dating can be considered suitable for the younger portions of the core, techniques based upon the U-series may not be as efficacious in dating this important record of climatic change.</dc:description><dc:publisher>University of Arizona Department of Geosciences</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-26T08:51:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-26T08:51:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:36Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>300298 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Weinstein-Evron, M, et al. 2001.

An investigation has been carried out using a small-angle generator and an autocollimator to determine the effect of flatness deviations of the measuring surfaces on angle measurements. The small-angle generator, together with a translation stage and tilt table, was also used to determine the effect of eccentricity and pyramidal errors. These methods were developed to calculate the related uncertainties associated with flatness deviations, eccentricity and pyramidal errors on face-to-face angle measurements.

Improvements to the LDA in the form of a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are explored. Structural parameters predicted by the LDA, as expected, underestimate experiment within a 1%-2% margin of accuracy. The GGA does not give a good account in the prediction of lattice parameter c, especially in graphite, although it does give a reliable description of LiC6. The effect on intercalating lithium into graphite, where charge transfer from lithium to carbon layers (graphenes) is expected, is discussed from the valence charge density, partial density of states, and energy band structure plots. The latter plot is also compared with inelastic neutron scattering results and low-energy electron diffraction results. We extend this work by calculating the elastic constants and bulk modulus for both graphite and LiC6 structures. These results are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. The calculated hydrostatic pressure dependence of the crystal structures is also found to be in good agreement with the results of high-resolution x-ray structural studies and with other experimental data as well as with other calculations. The analysis of electronic structure at 0 GPa (ambient pressure) is used to resolve inconsistencies between previous LDA calculations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>American Physical Society</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T13:37:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T13:37:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:39Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2003-11</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1879841 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Kganyago, KR and Ngoepe, PE. 2003.

An antiplane strain problem is also presented, where slip occurs along a crack near the surface of a half plane.

Electrical resistivity imaging or tomography (RESTOM) is well suited to mapping sinkholes because of the ability of the technique for detecting resistive features and discriminating subtle resistivity variations. RESTOM surveys were conducted at two sinkhole sites near Pretoria, South Africa. The survey areas are located in the dolomites of the Lyttelton Formation, which forms part of the Malamani Subgroup and Chuniespoort Group of the Transvaal Super group. The survey results suggest that RESTOM is an ideal geophysical tool to aid in the detection and monitoring of sinkholes and other subsurface cavities.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:37:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:37:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:43Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2002-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>327791 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Van Schoor, M. 2002.

These dies consist of defined number of slots with non-circular geometries on their peripheries and the filaments are produced when the slots in disk and annulus are offset from each other. The effect of die rotation on the shape of filament is investigated by analysing the polymer flow inside the complex die slots including square and trapezoidal shapes, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

The Okavango River water and its ecosystem resources are critically important sources of livelihoods for people in the basin. Pressures from livelihoods and development are already impacting on the environment. These pressures may increase in the future due to the rapid increase in population, the peace process and associated resettlement activities in Angola, and major development initiatives in Botswana and Namibia. For instance, possible future increase in water abstraction from the Okavango River may affect the long-term environmental sustainability of the Okavango Delta by minimizing channel shifting and thereby reducing spatial biodiversity. The paper argues that while conservation of the natural environment is critical, the pressing development needs must be recognized. The reduction of poverty within the basin should be addressed in order to alleviate adverse effects on the environment. The paper recommends that the development of sustainable tourism and community-based natural resource management initiatives may be appropriate strategies for reaching the Millennium Development Goals of poverty alleviation and achievement of environmental sustainability in the Okavango Basin. These initiatives have a comparative advantage in this area as demonstrated by the performance of the existing projects.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T13:44:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T13:44:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-04</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>2000842 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Kgathi, DL, et al. 2006.

Continuous local surface layer measurements of wind and temperature at 5 and 10 m provide the context for interpreting the boundary layer profiles. The fast field program (FFP) was used to predict the directionally dependent attenuation of a 15-Hz signal under these measured atmospheric conditions, the attenuation curves are used to estimate elephant infrasonic calling range and calling area, Directionality and calling range are shown to be controlled by the diurnal cycle in wind (shear) and temperature. Low-level nocturnal radiative temperature inversions and low surface wind speeds make the early evening the optimum time for the transmission of low-frequency sound at Etosha, with range at a maximum and directionality at a minimum, As the night progresses, a nocturnal low-level wind maximum (jet) forms, reducing upwind range and calling area, The estimated calling area drops rapidly after sunrise with the destruction of the inversion, Daytime calling areas are usually less than 50 km(2), while early evening calling areas frequently exceed 200 km(2) and are much less directional, This marked diurnal cycle will be present in any dry savanna climate, with variations due to local topography and climate, Calling range and low-frequency sound propagation cannot be effectively understood without knowledge of meteorological controls</dc:description><dc:publisher>American Institude of Physics</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-28T08:37:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-28T08:37:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:47Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1997-03</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>190439 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Larom, D, et al. 1997.

This paper develops an ecological-economic argument for the effective management of plant invasions in mountain fynbos ecosystems. We do this by building a dynamic ecological economic model which values the ecosystem services that fynbos ecosystems provide under different management regimes. We propose that the services that mountain fynbos ecosystems provide fall into six components: water production, wildflower harvest, hiker visitation, ecotourist visitation, endemic species and genetic storage. A scenario analysis based on a hypothetical 4 km(2) mountain fynbos ecosystem in the western part of the fynbos biome estimated that the ecosystem's value varies from R19 million (under low valuation and poor management scenario) to R300 million (under high valuation and good management scenario) [R4.50=US$1]. Water production and genetic storage were the most valuable ecosystem services. The model showed that the cost of clearing alien plants (under the proactive management scenario) was a tiny (0.6-5%) proportion of the value of mountain fynbos ecosystems. This result motivates an injection of funds for clearing alien plants from mountain fynbos ecosystems.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-07T13:44:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-07T13:44:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:48Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1997-08</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1013522 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Higgins, SI, et al. 1997.

In response, a protocol was established for the first quantitative and qualitative evaluation of relatively low cost small-scale incinerators for use at rural primary healthcare clinics. The protocol comprised the first phase of four, which defined the comprehensive trials of three incineration units. The trials showed that all of the units could be used to render medical waste non-infectious, and to destroy syringes or render needles unsuitable for reuse. Emission loads from the incinerators are higher than large-scale commercial incinerators, but a panel of experts considered the incinerators to be more acceptable compared to the other waste treatment and disposal options available in under-serviced rural areas. However, the incinerators must be used within a safe waste management programme that provides the necessary resources in the form of collection containers, maintenance support, acceptable energy sources, and understandable operational instructions for the incinerators, whilst minimising the exposure risks to emissions through the correct placement of the units in relation to the clinic and the surrounding communities. On-going training and awareness building are essential in order to ensure that the incinerators are correctly used as a sustainable waste treatment option.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T11:58:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T11:58:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>383849 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Rogers, DEC and Brent, AC. 2006.

Yet, a ready source of information on the extent, and probable hydrological impacts, of afforestation in specific locations in South Africa has not been available. This paper reports on the modelling exercise conducted to produce an easy-to-use, handy catalogue to fill this need, and presents some of the notable results of this exercise. Databases of quaternary catchment and magisterial district boundaries, rainfall, streamflow, forestry areas by tree genus, timber rotation lengths (years) and forestry growth potential were combined by means of a geographical information system to delineate uniform blocks of forestry. On these blocks a robust empirical model predicted total and low-flow reductions as a function of rotation, length, tree genus, water availability, growth potential and plantation age distribution. The results were summarised by quaternary, tertiary, secondary and primary catchment, and by magisterial district and province. The area of commercial timber plantations in South Africa is estimated at 1.5 million ha (57% pine, 35% eucalypts and 8% wattle), covering just 1.2% of South Africa. But the regions in which forestry is concentrated receive higher rainfall and yield a disproportionately large share of the streamflow, particularly low flow (dry-season flow). The commercial plantations are estimated to reduce mean annual streamflow by 3.2% (1417 x 10(6) m(3)) and low flows by 7.8% (101 x 10(6) m(3)/yr). Our estimate of an average reduction of 98.6 mm/yr per unit of planted area is 13% lower than the previous nation-wide estimate (113.6 mm/yr) of the net effect of forestry on total water resources (DWA, 1986). Mpumalanga Province with the highest concentration of forestry (7.2% of land area) experiences the largest reductions in flow - almost 10% of total flow and 18% of low flows. However, the largest relative impacts on low flow are seen in Northern Province where small areas of forestry are confined to humid upper catchments that are the principal source of dry-season flow in otherwise dry secondary catchments.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Water Research Commission</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T12:29:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T12:29:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:51Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1998-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>79502 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Scott, DF, Le Maitre, DC and Fairbanks, DHK. 1998.

It is important to optimize their dating, which is sometimes complicated by root contamination. Thirteen new radiocarbon dates are presented from one of the most significant spring pollen sequences on which South African vegetation history is based, namely, from Wonderkrater in the Savanna Biome. Some anomalous measurements were recorded but a new chronology is proposed by excluding samples that were possibly contaminated by younger or older materials. The dating places the pollen-based vegetation history more firmly in a framework of regional and global climate change during the Late Quaternary, thereby making the information more suitable for comparison with other sequences and as vegetation data in global-change modelling.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Acad Science South Africa</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T12:35:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T12:35:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003-09</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1566806 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Scott, L, et al. 2003.

Healthy, adult P. perna were collected and immersed in 2 free-flow tanks. Mercury was added to seawater as it entered tank 1 to achieve a constant level of 50 mu g/1(-1) over 24 days. Uncontaminated sea, water was circulated over the mussels in tank 2 (control) for the same period. A 25 mm (2) area of gill filament was removed from each of the 5 specimens before and after 24 days immersion in tank 2, and after immersion for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 days in tank I. These were examined using a scanning electron microscope. The remaining soft tissues from each animal were analysed for mercury using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Mercury concentration increased from 0.13 (pre-immersion) to 87 mu g/g after day 24. Surface morphology remained normal for all animals in tank 2 and for those exposed to Hg for up to 8 days, However, from 16 to 24 days exposure there was a gradual increase in the diameters of microvilli, a depletion of abfrontal cilia, an increase in abnormal, perhaps necrotic cells and an unusual increase in the number of cilia on the lateral surfaces. These results confirm that P. perna is an efficient bio-accumulator and suggest that their gill pathomorphology mag be a useful indicator of toxicity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-20T12:41:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-20T12:41:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:54Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1999-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1676788 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Gregory, MA, et al. 1999.

This approach is based on a novel superposition scheme and the analytical solution to the problem of a displacement discontinuity element within bonded half-planes. A three-layered elastic region is obtained by superposing two sets of bonded half-planes and subtracting one infinite plane. The advantages of this approach are: (1) it is not necessary to introduce elements at the interface, (2) the method is applicable for three dimensional modelling and (3) it can be extended to an N (N &gt; 3) layer system easily. The accuracy of the model is illustrated by comparing the numerical results with the analytical solutions for a hole in an infinite strip in tension and with the numerical solution for a pressurized crack within a three-layered system. In order to show the efficacy of the developed model, the simulation results of a typical South African mining problem and general tunnel excavation problems are also presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:12:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T09:12:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:02:57Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1999-09</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>267128 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Shou, KJ and  Napier, JAL. 1999.

Measurements of the strength of the Earth's gravitational field can also be used, since the more dense the rocks, the stronger the field. The interpretation of large amounts of data can be aided by "automatic" interpretation techniques such as Euler deconvolution. This considers the anomalies to be caused by many relatively simple sources (such as dipoles or lines of dipoles) and produces the positions and depths of these sources.

The 3-PG process-based forest model was evaluated in South Africa using limited Eucalyptus and Pinus trial data. Some uncertainties exist, as to whether 3-PG will prove to be a practical forest management tool on forestry estates. The question is, will the 3-PG process be capable of modelling growth over a wide range of site growth? And if there are practical methods for estimating or measuring all of the required parameter values for the model.12 stands of Eucalyptus grandis by camaldulensis hybrid clones, representing early, mid and late rotation age, and covering a wide range of site growth potential in KwaZulu-Natal- South Africa, were intensively studied over a period of 12 months, so as to answer the above questions. Measurements of initial and final biomass, leaf area index, biomass allometric ratios, litterfall, sap-flow rates, pre-dawn xylem pressure potential and weather conditions were made throughout the year. Two site parameter values required indirect estimation, since relevant information was lacking and not available. A practical approach is described. Annual tree growth predicted by the model, and daily ranges of sap flow, were compared to field measurements. Predictions of annual growth increment were acceptable for 11 of the 12 stands. The twelfth stand was under predicted because it had a high annual growth increment, high leaf area and year long access by the trees to shallow groundwater, likely credited by physiological adaptations to the long-term absence of water stress at the site. The authors conclude that 3-PG can simulate growth and water use. Preliminary sets of model parameter values for a range of diverse stands may be estimated over a relatively short period using simple field equipment and techniques. Further testing of these parameter values at physiologically significant times over the remainder of the rotation is recommended to test model output and permit fine-tuning of parameters</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-12T13:29:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-12T13:29:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:00Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2004-05-17</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>432626 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Dye, PJ, Jacobs, S and Drew, D. 2004.

A study was undertaken to evaluate ten of the most well-known mathematical cross-shore transport models with regard to different model requirements. The characteristics of these time-dependent models were investigated and the pros and cons of each are listed. The ranges of the data used to verify and calibrate these models are noted. It is concluded that the models can be classified generally into three groups with regard to their theoretical basis (Re. mainly sediment transport) and the extent to which they were verified (re. mainly morphodynamics). These groups are termed the ''best'', ''acceptable'' and ''less suitable'' groups. However, it is very important to consider the specific purpose of a model application. In some instances one model may perform better while for a different purpose another model may be better. Data are generally lacking for accretionary events and for erosion cases where the significant wave heights exceed 2.5 m. Aspects presently usually not included in these models are also listed. Without direct comparative prototype tests the final conclusion as to which are the better models in practice cannot be given. Furthermore models may be best applicable under different specific conditions. Models are also constantly being improved and thus a comparative evaluation of the models can only be completely accurate for a relatively short time.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T09:31:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T09:31:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:02Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1995-05</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>3091315 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Schoonees, JS and Theron, AK. 1995.

This study assessed the suitability of 278 strains of South African wood-decay fungi for the pre-treatment of softwood chips for kraft pulping. The influence of these fungi on kappa number, yield and strength properties of pulp was evaluated. A number of these strains were more efficient in reducing kappa number than the frequently used strains of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. Six strains of Stereum hirsutum and a strain of an unidentified species were able to reduce the kappa number significantly without a significant influence on the pulp yield. Treatment of wood with two strains of S. hirsutum, one strain of Peniophora sp. and a strain of an unidentified species resulted in paper with improved strength properties. This paper demonstrates the importance of screening to select superior fungal strains for use in biopulping. Under the specific pulping conditions of the screening trials, 38 strains of white-rot  fungi were tested that were more suitable than the reference strains of P. chrysosporium and C. subvermispora. The importance of mini pulping experiments to select the strains with the greatest benefit in a biokraft pulping process was also evident.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsvier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:55:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:55:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:03Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2004-10</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>259994 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Wolfaardt, F, et al. 2004.

An estimated 43,000 deaths per annum, including 20% of deaths in the 1-5 years age group, are directly attributable to diarrhoeal diseases. Drinking water quality provision in many rural areas is substandard. This paper describes the results of sampling drinking water supplies in rural communities in the Western and Eastern Cape, South Africa. The majority of samples collected failed microbial drinking water quality standards. Overall, schemes dependent on groundwater provided worse quality water at point of use than surface-water-dependant schemes. This is thought to be the result of pump breakdown, deterioration of the storage and reticulation system, and insufficient monitoring and management of the schemes. Importantly, it is shown that the implementation of well-considered, community accepted drinking-water quality management procedures can effectively change an unacceptable water quality to one that satisfies drinking-water specifications.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer-Verlag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:21:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T13:21:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003-05</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>160597 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Mackintosh, G, Colvin, C. 2003.

In this study, the authors used the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to gain insights into the local environments of the Cd and Pb cations (as a function of composition and temperature) in CdF2 (xPbF(2)) mixed-cation superionic fluorites. A high degree of disorder is shown around both cations. However, the extent of disorder is even larger around the Pb2+ in the entire series of solid solutions, with the highest disorder noted for the x = 60 mol% PbF2 sample. The large values of the Debye-Waller factors of the Pb-F interactions are consistent with the low amplitudes of their Fourier transforms. This can be correlated with relative ionic conductivities of each composition in these materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) has been used as a complementary technique on structural properties; systems were modelled at temperatures ranging from liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K, to 300 K. Our MD results confirm that disorder is greatest at concentrations x approximate to 60 mol% PbF2.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T07:49:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T07:49:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:07Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2005-10-19</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>293670 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Netshisaulu, TT, et al. 2005.

Direct sunlight caused air turbulence within the instrument, resulting in 13.6% variability of the calibration factor. Shading the instrument eliminated this effect. A residual temperature dependence of the calibration factor was reduced to negligible levels with an improved photomultiplier tube. A superior detector head permits field servicing of the instrument, and has reduced one component of the instrumental background by a factor of 2. The other component probably constitutes thoron emissions from the stainless steel walls. The detection limit of the instrument could be reduced from its current 33 to 20 mBq m(-3) if the thoron were to be eliminated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Pergamon-Elsevier Science Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-11T11:29:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-11T11:29:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002-05</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>129916 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Brunke, EG et al. 2002.

The preferred epitaxial orientation of (100) GaAs/ (lll) CdTe was found to be unsuitable due to the formation of electrically active defects in the material. An intermediate ZnTe layer was used to select the (100) orientation and (100) CdTe layers were then deposited on this ZnTe layer. The quality of the resultant CdTe buffer was found to critically depend on the thickness of this intermediate ZnTe buffer, with a ZnTe thickness of approximately 500 angstrom producing the best CdTe buffer. (CdHg)Te epilayers grown on these ZnTe/CdTe buffers had improved electrical properties, but still suffered from a poor surface morphology. This surface morphology could be improved by using a lattice matched Cd0.96Zn0.04Te alloy as the final buffer layer, but the surface pyramids typical of the (100) orientation could never be completely eliminated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-20T12:42:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-20T12:42:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:09Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1993-05</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>3068044 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Gouws, GJ, Muller, RN and Bowden, RS. 1993.

Three concentrations of copper (0.035, 0.17 and 0.69 mg kg (-1)) were added. FFA values for all the sample treatments increased slightly over the storage period but remained within acceptable limits. PV of the copper-containing samples declined initially and then remained stable up to week 40, after which it increased slightly for the 0.035 and 0.17 mg kg(-1) samples. However, PV of the control (no added copper) increased steadily to above the acceptable limit. AV of the copper-containing samples increased much more than that of the control. OSI and total tocopherol values of the copper-containing samples were markedly lower than those of the control. T-2-Hexenal did not increase during the storage period, whereas hexanal increased in the copper-containing samples but at a slower rate than in the control. Conversely, the copper-containing samples had high levels of t,t-2,4-decadienal but the control had none.

Each biocatalyst exhibited a distinctive substrate selectivity profile, generally related to the length of the aliphatic chain of the arylaliphatic nitrile and the position of substituents on the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain. Cell-free nitrilases generally exhibited a narrower substrate range than resting whole cells of Rhodococcus strains. The Rhodococcus strains all exhibited nitrile hydratase activity and converted beta-hydroxy nitriles (but did not demonstrate enantioselectivity on this substrate). The biocatalysts also mediated the synthesis of a range of alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids or amides from aldehydes in the presence of cyanide. The use of an amidase inhibitor permits halting the nitrile hydratase/amidase reaction at the amide intermediate.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer-Verlag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-01-12T10:14:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-01-12T10:14:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004-03</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>122557 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Brady, D, et al. 2004.

The aim is to identify the generic zones of various types of strong wind events. The extent of these zones will form the basis for determining the characteristics of typical wind events and subsequently their probabilities of occurrence. No information of this nature is currently available for South Africa. However in the absence of significant seismicity in South Africa, wind forms the most devastating environmental factor affecting the built environment. Several significant wind disasters have occurred including recent events. For example in 1990, 4000 houses were damaged as well as 17 power lines in Welkom. Another example is the Cape Peninsula were 4500 housing units, both formal and informal, were destroyed in 1997. In Umtata in 1998, 18 people died and a lot of houses and buildings were shattered.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:40:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:40:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:12Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2002-11</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>364159 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Goliger, AM and Retief, JV. 2002.

Students at four schools were given: (a) a questionnaire to assess their existing knowledge of fynbos; (b) a slide show; and (c) a second questionnaire to determine how effectively this information changed their perceptions and understanding of fynbos' benefits and values. Prior to the presentation, few students had any knowledge of the consumptive-use benefits of fynbos. Those from privileged backgrounds knew more about the non-consumptive use benefits of fynbos than the less privileged. Most students initially attached little value to fynbos, but the information in the presentation markedly increased their appreciation of fynbos and demonstrates the positive impact of enhanced understanding. Students from privileged backgrounds continued to rank non-consumptive benefits (aesthetic and bequest values) most important. The less advantaged students felt that consumptive benefits (remunerative and subsistence) were most important. Nevertheless, even students from disadvantaged backgrounds considered the non-consumptive benefits of fynbos to be important. This is crucial because support for the conservation of natural resources in South Africa will depend largely on the extent to which stakeholders understand and appreciate the benefits they receive.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science BV</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:06:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T07:06:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997-08</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>1064523 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>LeMaitre, D, et al. 1997.

However, the need to develop constitutive models of basic failure processes resulted in the adoption of a tessellation approach to simulate grain interaction and breakage. Linear variation displacement discontinuity elements are arranged in structures which simulate the microstructure of the rock by applying either a Voronoi (polygonal) or Delaunay (triangular) tessellation procedure. The tessellation approach has been applied to investigate the role of micromechanical mechanisms such as pre-existing pores and sliding flaws on the macroscopic failure patterns at a scale that is representative of realistic rock microstructures. Procedures for calculating the crack density tensors and the average stress and strain in a sample permit comparison of the results with alternative models of brittle fracture such as continuum damage mechanics. Simulations of laboratory tests have revealed that the tessellation approach can represent experimentally observed macroscopic failure modes such as splitting in uniaxial compression and shear band formation in biaxial compression, as well as the dependence of strength and inelastic deformation on the flaw density.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer-Verlag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:53:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:53:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:14Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1997-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>296554 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Sellers, E and Napier, J. 1997.

The concept of electronic initiation is presenting itself as a challenge to traditional initiation systems, particularly cap-and-fuse and shock tube technologies. From a technology strategy viewpoint, the challenge is to determine the nature of the managerial decisions that have to be addressed. The Utterback-Abernathy innovation model is used to assess the evolution of the emerging technology; it is found that the technology is still in the fluid phase and that a dominant design has not yet emerged. Since the dominant design is a very important milestone in the evolvement of the product with regard to both the technical and the business aspects, the immediate managerial focus should be on the evaluation factors that may influence the emergence of the dominant design. The emergence of a dominant design is, however, a complex process that depends on the interplay between a myriad of issues, including technological, market, social, economic, and related aspects. The paper anticipates the technological future of the innovation by exploring the factors that may influence the dominant design of electronic initiation systems, and casts the findings in a format that is useful for managerial decision support.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Elsevier Science Inc</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:51:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-06T08:51:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:16Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1998-11</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>112744 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Smit, FC and Pistorius, CWI. 1998.

In other words, the grass production declines more steeply per unit increase in tree quantity at low tree cover than at high tree cover. Since much of the economic value in savannas is ultimately derived from grass, and the main mechanism controlling the tree-grass balance is dependent on the production of grassy fuel for fires, this non-linearity has the effect of creating two savannas configurations. One has a low tree density and supports a viable grazing enterprise, while the other has dense tree cover and a frequently non-viable grazing enterprise. The non-linearity is suggested here to have two main sources: the geometry of the spatial interaction between tree root system and grasses, and the effect of differing phenology (the time course of leaf area exposure) on the acquisition of water and nutrients. The existence of the non-linearity reduces the resilience of the generally-preferred "open" configuration, and increases the resilience of the less-desirable "closed" configuration.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Kluwer Academic Publishers</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-02-08T09:30:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02-08T09:30:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:18Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>2003-12</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>904276 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Scholes RJ. 2003.

Leaking magnetic fields, as well as those due to the surroundings of the balance, can interact with the artifact whose mass is to be determined, causing erroneous values to be observed. For this reason, and to comply with normative standards, it has become important for mass metrologists to evaluate the magnetic susceptibility and any remanent magnetization that mass standards may possess. This paper describes a comparison of measurements of these parameters among seventeen national metrology institutes. The measurements are made on three transfer standards whose magnetic parameters span the range that might be encountered in stainless steel mass standards.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IOP Publishing Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-14T14:19:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-14T14:19:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-09</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>159282 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Becerra, LO, et al. 2006.

Factors contributing to high microbial numbers are high density population with limited services provided per site, sabotage of the sewage reticulation system, lack of money and management skills to provide the essential services and limited integrated development planning for the catchment. Due to non-steady state conditions in the catchment, the specific use and physical characteristics of the river and the difficulty in determining flow, the usefulness of a steady-state stream water quality model as a management tool is limited. Determining the decay rate of micro-organisms by means of chamber studies, may be a first step to predict microbial water quality.

The researchers found that the use of natural resources was extensive, the most common being wooden utensils, grass handbrooms, twig handbrooms, fuel wood, wild herbs, wild fruit and edible insects. Households in the poorest of the three villages consumed the most wooden utensils, wild herbs, wild fruit and thatching grass. Fuel wood was widely used, even though two of the three villages had electricity, and consumption was highest in the largest, most developed village. The mean annual direct-use value of indigenous bio-resources, averaged across all households, was R3959 per household or R564 per person. The value was highest in the poorest of the three villages. Poor households relied most heavily on 'essential' natural resources such as wild foods, whereas comparatively wealthy households used a wider range of resources and utilized greater amounts of 'luxury' items, such as wooden utensils and poles. These findings are discussed in the context of poverty and sustainable rural development, and should be of value to scientists, community developers, and policy-makers</dc:description><dc:publisher>Acad Science South Africa</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-14T07:23:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-14T07:23:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003-09</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>233625 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Twine, W, et al. 2003.

This was achieved through the determination of the radius of influence of a single vent well, the soil gas permeability of the site and the oxygen utilisation rate of the in situ micro-organisms. The on-site test used one vent well and three monitoring wells. A radius of influence of 9.5 m was determined. A soil gas permeability of 3.8 Darcy was measured. The oxygen utilisation of 1.32% (v/v) O-2/h indicated that an active microbial population existed in situ. The theoretical biodegradation rate was calculated to be 752 mg hydrocarbon (based on hexane)/kg soil-month. Based on these results, bioventing was found to be a feasible bioremediation option for cleanup of the site, provided that other soil conditions were suitable for biological activity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Water Research Commission</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-26T09:50:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-26T09:50:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:26Z</dc:date><dc:date></dc:date><dc:date>1998-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>74070 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Pearce, K and Pretorius, WA. 1998.

Theoretical estimates show an exponential dependence on the ratio of the spacing between gliding planes and the unit slip distance. Nabarro corrected an error of a factor of 2 in this exponent in Peierls's original estimate. A revised estimate by Huntington introduced a further factor of 2. Three experimental estimates are available, from the Bordoni peaks (which agrees with the Huntington theory), from the how stress at low temperatures (which agrees with the P-N (Peierls-Nabarro) theory) and from the rate of Harper-Dorn creep (which agrees with the P-N theory). Since the Huntington theory is clearly better founded than that of P-N, the agreement of two experimental results with P-N is unexpected. The discrepancy is resolved by using a recent result by Schoeck.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-03-27T07:20:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03-27T07:20:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-06-07T10:03:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997-03</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>522631 bytes</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>Nabarro, FRN. 1997.

Annual production varied considerably for individual plots, but the mean production per woody standing biomass was relatively constant from year to year at approximately 17 kg/ha/year per ton live biomass, or 1.7% per annum. Annual production of harvestable deadwood was related more to stand biomass than rainfall zone.
