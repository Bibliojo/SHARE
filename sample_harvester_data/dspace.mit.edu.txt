From the fundamental knowledge obtained through these measurements, information about the underlying spectroscopy, dynamics, and kinetics of the species interrogated can be derived. The construction of an ICLA Spectrometer will be detailed, and the measurements utilizing ICLAS will be discussed, as well as the theory of operation and modifications of the experimental apparatus. Results include: i) Line intensities and collision-broadening coefficients of the A band of oxygen and previously unobserved, high J, rotational transitions of the A band, hot-band transitions, and transitions of isotopically substituted species. ii) High-resolution (0.013 cm-1) spectra of the second overtone of the OH stretch of trans-nitrous acid recorded between 10,230 and 10,350 cm-1. The spectra were analyzed to yield a complete set of rotational parameters and an absolute band intensity, and two groups of anharmonic perturbations were observed and analyzed. These findings are discussed in the context of the contribution of overtone-mediated processes to OH radical production in the lower atmosphere.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) iii) The implementation of Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) for time-resolved studies of CN fragments generated by the excimer laser photolysis of acrylonitrile. iv) The extension of ICLAS to study the kinetics of a test system. Nitrosyl hydride, HNO, was reacted with oxygen in a flow cell, and the subsequent chemistry was monitored using an electronic transition of HNO. Analysis of the rate equations and time integrated measured signal yielded a preliminary value for the rate constant of the reaction, HNO + 02 [right arrow] products.</dc:description><dc:description>by Scott Kenneth Witonsky.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.D.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Chemistry, 2002.</dc:description><dc:description>Vita.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 133-138).</dc:description><dc:publisher>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

J. (Christopher James), 1974-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Nuclear Engineering.</dc:subject><dc:description>This dissertation reports on the development of a diagnostic visible imaging system on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak and the results from that system. The dissertation asserts the value of this system as a qualitative and quantitative diagnostic for magnetically confined plasmas. The visible imaging system consists of six CCD cameras, absolutely calibrated and filtered for specific spectral ranges. Two of these cameras view the divertor region tangentially, two view RF antenna structures and two are used for a wide-angle survey of the vacuum vessel. The divertor viewing cameras are used to generate two-dimensional emissivity profiles using tomography. Three physics issues have been addressed using the visible imaging system: 1) Using two-dimensional emissivity profiles of Da, volumetric recombination rate profiles have been measured and found to have a structure that depends on a poloidal temperature gradient in the outer scrape-off-layer. 2) A camera viewing the inner wall tangentially was used to measure Da emission profiles. A sharp break in slope of the radial density profile was found at the location of the secondary separatrix near the inner wall by using these profiles and a kinetic model of the neutrals. 3) Two-dimensional emissivity profiles of visible continuum (420-430nm) have been measured and found to be an order of magnitude too large when compared to expected levels from electron-ion bremsstrahlung and radiative recombination. Several atomic and molecular processes have been considered to explain the enhanced continuum. However, none of the considered processes could explain the continuum level without particle densities inconsistent with current modeling efforts.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The visible imaging system was also used in identifying the causes of impurity injections during discharges, in identifying the failure of invessel components, and as a monitor of vessel and plasma conditions. Both the physics results and the operational benefits of the visible imaging system show that the system is a valuable quantitative and qualitative diagnostic.</dc:description><dc:description>by Christopher James Boswell.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The role that atomistic modeling plays is important and indispensable in that it can generate understanding of the physics and pass this mechanistic understanding as well as important parameters to higher level simulations. This thesis presents theories and simulations of defect nucleation and mobility in BCC transition metal molybdenum using atomistic methods, with the two primary defects of interest being dislocations and deformation twinning, and emphasis on the atomistic mechanisms and measures. The contributions presented in the thesis may be regarded as advances in both methods development and mechanistic understanding of dislocation mobility and twinning nucleation. For atomistic studies of dislocations in a simulation cell of finite size, new methods have been derived to (1) calculate the atomic displacement field under PBC and generate atomic dislocation configuration from this displacement field; (2) quantify artificial image effect for a dislocation moving within the periodic cell and optimize geometry of simulation cell to minimize such effects. These methodological breakthroughs serve as the basis for atomistic studies of dislocations and are used repeatedly in this thesis. To understand the complex plasticity behavior of BCC metal molybdenum, we need to first understand the most fundamental problem of core structure</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) and lattice resistance of straight dislocations before considering more complicated structures including kinks, jogs, junctions, etc. In this thesis, we examine the two major types of dislocations that are of primary interest in BCC molybdenum: screw dislocations, which is the major plasticity carrier at low temperatures, and edge dislocations, which become important at elevated temperatures. For screw dislocations, the issue of whether core is polarized or not is explored by a static calculation of core structure for the first time by a tight-binding potential. The screw core structure is determined to be non-polarized; however, the magnitude of Peierls stress, which is a measure of the lattice resistance to dislocation motion and is calculated accurately using a local-driving-force method in this thesis, remains rather high despite of the non-polarized core, suggesting that core polarization is a secondary and less important effect compared to core planarity. For edge dislocations in molybdenum, the core structure and Peierls stress is calculated using a Finnis-Sinclair potential and it is shown that edge dislocation in Mo has a planar core structure and a core width of approximately 11[angstroms], is indeed very mobile and has a Peierls stress of only 25 MPa, after correction for image effects due to boundary conditions. This new result is consistent with experimental observations of high mobility of edge dislocations and clearly rejects the proposal of kink mechanisms operating on edge dislocations that arose in the literature as a result of previous inaccurate Peierls stress calculations yielding an unrealistically high value of 700 MPa ...</dc:description><dc:description>by Jinpeng Chang.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Impurity gas (which for these experiments is deuterated ethylene, C₂D₄) is injected locally into the scrape-off layer (SOL) through the end of a reciprocating fast-scanning probe, and the resultant emission ("plume") is imaged from two near-perpendicular views. Plumes are generated at various SOL depths, while views are obtained using coherent fiber bundles optically coupled to gated, intensified CCD cameras through beam-splitters, allowing for the simultaneous acquisition of C⁺¹ and C⁺² emission. Plume structure is observed to depend on local values of electron density and temperature, background parallel flow (v[sub][parallel]), and radial electric field (E[sub]r). Emission resulting from sputtering of carbon deposited on the probe surface also contributes to the structure. For plumes generated in the near SOL, emission contours are non-elliptical and the parallel extent relative to the ionization mean-free path is large, indicating that transport of impurities near the probe is "jet"-like along B. Plume results also suggest an elongation of the impurity ion density down the probe axis. A Monte Carlo impurity transport code (LIM) was used to simulate the plumes. Results indicate that contributions to the emission from sputtering explain the cross-field plume width, and that the parallel extent of emission generated in the far SOL is well-described using a sputter launch-energy distribution for the impurities. In the near SOL, the presence of a localized parallel electric field arising from background ion recycling off the probe surface is necessary to explain the parallel extent of emission generated in this region.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) This electric field accelerates impurity ions formed near the probe tip away from the probe, causing jet-like behavior. LIM was also used to investigate causes for the vertical elongation of the impurity emission. Results suggest the existence of a probe-induced E x B drift, of order [approximately] 1000 m/s in the near SOL. This drift may be responsible for the transport of both impurity and bulk plasma ions down the probe axis. Values for v in the far SOL and E[sub]r in the near SOL have been extracted from the plume structure. A comparison between plume and probe results for E[sub]r suggests that calculations which employ a probe-sheath model may be in error, and that measurement of the poloidal propagation velocity of edge plasma fluctuations may be a more reliable means of inferring E[sub]r from probe data. Comparisons between plume- and probe-inferred values for the parallel Mach number suggest that the probe over-estimates parallel flow to the divertor in the far SOL, where effects of short field line connection to the divertor are important. This result strengthens the argument for the main-chamber recycling view of particle flows in the Alcator C-Mod SOL.</dc:description><dc:description>by Sanjay Gangadhara.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The historical increase in batch-averaged discharge fuel burnup, from ~30 MWd/kg in the 1970s to ~50 MWd/kg today, was achieved mainly by increasing the reload fuel enrichment to allow longer fuel cycles: from an average of 12 months to about 18 months. This also reduced operating costs by improving the plant capacity factor. Recently, because of limited spent fuel storage capacity, increased core power output and the search for increased proliferation resistance, achieving burnup in the 70 to 100 MWd/kg range has attracted considerable attention. However the implications of this initiative have not been fully explored; hence this work defines the practical issues for high-burnup PWR fuels based on neutronic, thermal hydraulic and economic considerations as well as spent fuel characteristics. In order to evaluate the various high burnup fuel design options, an improved MCNP-ORIGEN depletion program called MCODE was developed. A standard burnup predictor-corrector algorithm is implemented, which distinguishes MCODE from other MCNP-ORIGEN linkage codes. Using MCODE, the effect of lattice design (moderation effect) on core design and spent fuel characteristics is explored. Characterized by the hydrogen-to-heavy-metal ratio (H/HM), the neutron spectrum effect in UO2/H2O lattices is investigated for a wide range of moderation, from fast spectra to over-thermalized spectra. It is shown that either wetter or very dry lattices are preferable in terms of achievable burnup potential to those having an epithermal spectrum. Wet lattices are the preferred high burnup approach due to improved proliferation resistance. The constraint of negative moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) requires that H/HM values (now at 3.4) remain below ~6.0 for PWR lattices. Alternative fuel choices, including the conventional solid pellets, central-voided annular pellets, Internally- &amp; eXternally-cooled Annular Fuel (IXAF), and different fuel forms are analyzed to achieve a wetter lattice. Although a wetter lattice has higher burnup potential than the reference PWR lattice, the requirement of a fixed target cycle energy production necessitates higher initial fuel enrichments to compensate for the loss of fuel mass in a wetter lattice. Practical issues and constraints for the high burnup fuel include neutronic reactivity control, heat transfer margin, and fission gas release. Overall the IXAF design appears to be the most promising approach to realization of high burnup fuel. High-burnup spent fuel characteristics are compared to the reference spent fuel of 33 MWd/kg, representative of most of the spent fuel inventory. Although an increase of decay power and radioactivity per unit mass of initial heavy metal is immediately observed, the heat load (integration of decay power over time) per unit electricity generation decreases as the fuel discharge burnup increases. The magnitude of changes depends on the time after discharge. For the same electricity production, not only the mass and volume of the spent fuel are reduced, but also, to a lesser extent, the total heat load of the spent fuel. Since the heat load in the first several hundred years roughly determines the capital cost of the repository, a high burnup strategy coupled with adequate cooling time, may provide a cost-reduction approach to the repository. High burnup is beneficial to enhancing the proliferation resistance. The plutonium vector in the high-burnup spent fuel is degraded, hence less attractive for weapons. For example, the ratio of Pu-238 to Pu-239 increases with burnup to the 2.5 power. However, the economic benefits are uncertain. Under the current economic conditions, the PWR fuel burnup appears to have a shallow optimum discharge burnup between 50 and 80 MWd/kg. The actual minimum is influenced by the financing costs as well as the cost of refueling shutdowns. Since the fuel cycle back-end benefits will accrue to the federal government, the current economic framework, such as the waste fee based on the electricity produced rather than volume or actinide content, does not create an incentive for utilities to increase burnup. Different schemes exist for fuel management of high burnup PWR cores. For the conventional core design, a generalized enrichment-burnup correlation (applicable between 3 w/o and 20 w/o) was produced based on CASMO/SIMULATE PWR core calculations. Among retrofit cores, increasing the number of fuel batches is preferred over increasing the cycle length due to nuclear fuel cycle economic imperatives. For future core designs, a higher power-density core is a very attractive option to cut down the busbar cost. The IXAF concept possesses key design characteristics that provide the necessary thermal margins at high core power densities. In this regard, the IXAF fuel deserves further investigation to fully exploit its high burnup capability.</dc:description><dc:description>by Zhiwen Xu.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

In this thesis, I examine an approach in which city-wide efforts are undertaken to create a "city of art". Such attempts endeavor to infuse the entire city, not just specific districts, with arts and cultural activities and to develop a strong artistic inclination among its residents. Singapore"s recent plan to transform itself into a "Renaissance City" is an example of such an attempt to create a "city of art". I conceptualize urban cultural policies used to create "cities of art" as having two possible policy orientations. An externally-oriented policy is used to project a city"s cultural achievements into the international arena, often with the intention of generating economic growth and enhancing the city's image. An internally-oriented policy, on the other hand, is focused on cultivating cultural growth within the city and is more directed at achieving local socio-cultural advancement. While some cities may adopt urban cultural policies that are either strongly externally- or internally-oriented, other cities may have urban cultural policies that endeavor to balance both orientations. For Singapore, I will show that the urban cultural policy adopted to transform itself into a "Renaissance City" tries to be simultaneously externally- and internally-oriented. Despite the attempt to address both policy orientations, I argue that the Singapore government has inappropriately placed undue emphasis on external at the cost of internal strategies for arts and cultural development. To evaluate Singapore's vision of becoming a "Renaissance City", I will compare its recently proposed strategies under the two policy orientations to those of two other cities, Glasgow and Chicago, which have implemented their urban cultural policies since the 1980s. While Glasgow"s urban cultural policy is strongly externally-oriented, Chicago's policy is more internally-oriented. Through this comparative analysis, I propose recommendations that will help to enhance Singapore"s strategies to develop a "Renaissance City".</dc:description><dc:description>by Lee, Wai Kin.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning, 2003.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 173-180).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

Why is this? Three case studies of health networks were used to identify the barriers to the widespread use of telemedicine in home healthcare and other applications of medicine. These barriers were further described and analyzed using the framework for disruptive technologies presented in Clayton Christensen' s The Innovator' s Dilemma. Although many studies assert that the slow adoption rate of telemedicine is explained by questions of efficacy and cost, this analysis proposes that the change in value networks posed by telemedicine technology is the greatest reason for its anemic implementation. Telemedicine changes the structure of the healthcare sector changing the organizational dynamics and values of the many players. The changes in structure are explored using the case studies and the successes and failures experienced by the health networks when implementing telemedicine across medical specialties. In order to harness this technology, recommendations are directed at organizations that need to evaluate new technologies differently and change their behavior with respect to competitors. Public policy needs to recognize the need for a greater thrust in long-term investments in telemedicine research, greater awareness of telemedicine in medical education and in taking the lead in developing standards, guidelines and protocols for telemedicine networks. Research also needs to be encouraged in newer clinical areas and existing standards and technologies in mature telemedicine application areas such as teleradiology and telepathology may be used in medical specialties where telemedicine is not yet a mainstream application. Moreover, the technology needs to become more 'human-centered' , to reduce technology barriers for both providers and patients amongst whom the elderly may be predominant.</dc:description><dc:description>by Shaheen Malik.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program, 2003.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references.</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

These pathways allow cells to interact with each other and with their environments and are critical to the proper cellular function in a variety of contexts. Previously developed methods for analyzing signaling networks have been largely ignored, most likely due to their mathematical complexity and difficulty in application. A novel analysis framework was developed to assist in the examination of signaling networks, both to facilitate the reconstruction of previously undetermined pathways as well as to quantitatively characterize interactions between components. This approach, termed activation ratio analysis, involves the ratio between active and inactive forms of signaling intermediates at steady state. The activation ratio of an intermediate is shown to depend linearly upon the concentration of the activating enzyme. The slope of the line is defined as the activation factor, and is determined by the kinetic parameters of activation and inactivation. The mathematical functionality of the activation ratio changes for other signaling network arrangements. It is therefore possible to extract the original network structure from a set of measured activation ratios, with activation factors yielding a measure of activation potential between intermediates. This framework was tested using computational simulations of a small-scale interconnected network, cascades with feedback, and in the presence of experimental noise. In the process, additional tools were developed to automate and evaluate the analysis.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The theoretical concepts were also applied to examine the modification cycles of the protein Erk2 by the kinase Mekl and phosphatases PTP1B and PP2A in vitro. Limitations in the accuracy of measurements and experimental setup resulted in high uncertainty in the calculated distribution of Erk states, preventing a quantitative analysis of this system. Nevertheless, qualitative predictions from activation ratio analysis were verified, in particular, the influence of component concentrations on the Erk distribution at steady state. While these issues indicate considerations for future experimental studies, they do not override the ability of activation ratio analysis to investigate signaling networks, where description of interactions in the whole system is more important than detailed examination of the individual steps.</dc:description><dc:description>by Francisco Javier Femenia.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The strongly coupled asymmetric and symmetric carbonyl stretches of Rh(CO)₂C₅H₇0₂ (RDC) dissolved in hexane serve as a convenient model system. Fourier transform 2D IR spectra are obtained from heterodyne-detected third-order nonlinear signals using a sequence of broad bandwidth femtosecond IR pulses. A 2D IR correlation spectrum with absorptive lineshapes results from the addition of 2D rephasing and non-rephasing spectra, which sample conjugate frequencies in the evolution time period. The 2D IR correlation spectrum contains peaks with different positions, signs, amplitudes and lineshapes. The positions of the peaks map the transition frequencies between the ground, singly, and doubly excited states of the system, and thus describe the anharmonic vibrational potential. Peak amplitudes reflect the relative magnitudes and orientations of the transition dipole moments in the molecular frame, the electrical anharmonicity of the system, and the vibrational relaxation dynamics. The 2D line shapes are sensitive to the complicated system-bath interactions in solution. 2D IR spectra taken with varying polarization conditions and as a function of a variable waiting time can be used to isolate and quantify these spectroscopic observables. The polarization-selective 2D IR spectra of RDC in hexane are analyzed in terms of two coupled local coordinates to obtain their mutual orientation and the magnitude of the coupling between them. Evidence of vibrational coherence transfer between close-lying transition frequencies is indicated by the presence of extra induced peaks in 2D IR</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) rephasing spectra. The data is modeled by using Redfield theory to account for coherence transfer, vibrational dephasing and population relaxation in a multilevel vibrational system. Building on the studies of the RDC model system, 2D IR spectroscopy is used to study the thermal denaturation of RNase A by characterizing the temperature-dependent Amide I band. A nonlinear IR probe is used to study the early events in the laser temperature-jump initiated denaturation of RNase A.</dc:description><dc:description>by Munira Khalil.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The highly conserved AAA+ Clp/Hsp100 proteins are ATPases which function as disassembly chaperones as well as essential components of energy-dependent proteases. For example, the ClpX ATPase disassembles macromolecular complexes and combines with the ClpP peptidase to form ClpXP, a molecular machine with structural and functional similarity to the eukaryotic 26S proteasome. ClpXP consists of hexameric ClpX rings stacked coaxially against the double-ring ClpP₁₄ peptidase. ClpXP's peptidase active sites reside in a sequestered chamber accessible through a narrow channel which excludes native, folded substrates. ClpX binds specific substrates, unfolds them in a reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis, and then translocates them into ClpP for degradation. When ClpP is absent, ClpX unfolds and releases specific substrates, an activity that can disassemble otherwise stable complexes. Although ClpX-mediated substrate unfolding and ClpXP-mediated degradation have been studied extensively, the role of communication between subunits within a ClpX hexamer or between enzymes in ClpXP has not been addressed. I initially screened numerous ClpX point mutants for their ability to support host-cell lysis by bacteriophage Mu, and then purified several mutants for functional characterization in vitro. Three of these mutants contained substitutions at intersubunit interfaces; these variants bound substrate well, but displayed unusual changes in ATP hydrolysis in response to substrate binding and had low protein unfolding activity.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) These results suggest that communication across these subunit-subunit interfaces coordinates and regulates nucleotide hydrolysis in response to substrate binding and is critical for efficient substrate unfolding. I also discovered that ClpX and ClpP communicate with each other during substrate processing and degradation. ClpX binds ClpP more strongly during substrate unfolding than during translocation, by a mechanism that is linked to the ATP hydrolysis rate. Interaction between ClpX and DFP-modified ClpP, mimicking a peptide-cleavage intermediate, is strengthened significantly suggesting that ClpP also communicates its functional state to ClpX. Overall, this work suggests that communication within the ClpX hexamer and between enzymes in ClpXP modulates and coordinates substrate processing.</dc:description><dc:description>by Shilpa Arun Joshi.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

This makes them amenable to powering from ambient sources such as vibration. In this case, they can become autonomous. Motivated by this application, this thesis provides the necessary tools to analyze, design and fabricate MEMS devices capable of electrostatic vibration-to-electric energy conversion at the microwatt level. The fundamental means of en- ergy conversion is a variable capacitor that is excited through a generating energy conversion cycle with every vibration cycle of the converter. This thesis presents a road map on how to design MEMS electrostatic vibration-to- electric energy converters. A proposed converter is designed to illustrate the design process, and is based on vibration levels typical of rotating machinery, which are around 2% of the acceleration of gravity from 1-5 kHz. The converter consists of a square centimeter with a 195 mg proof mass which travels ±200 pm. This mass and travel can couple to a sinusoidal acceleration source of 0.02g at 2.5 kHz, typical of rotating machinery, so as to capture 24 nJ per cycle. This moving proof mass is designed to provide a variable capacitor ranging from 1 pF to 80 pF. Adding a capacitor of 88 pF in parallel with this device will result in a capacitance change from 168 pF to 89 pF that is required to extract 24 nJ using a charge-constrained cycle.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) This device can be attached to power electronics that implement a charge-constrained cycle and deliver 0.5 nJ back to the reservoir for a total power output of 1.3 [mu]/W at 2.5 kHz. The efficiency of the electrical conversion is 2%. Including packaging, the power per volume would be 0.87 [mu]W/cm3 and the power per mass would be 1.3 [mu]W/g. System improvements are also identified such as those that address the principal sources of loss. For example, decreasing the output capacitance of the MOSFET switches from 10 pF to 1 pF, while keeping the energy conversion cycle the same, results in an energy output of 13 nJ out of 24 nJ, for an efficiency of 54% and a power output of 33 [mu]W. This argues strongly for the use of integrated circuits in which the output capacitance of the MOSFET switches can be reduced for this application.</dc:description><dc:description>José Oscar Mur Miranda.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

(Francis Russell), 1976-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</dc:subject><dc:description>Forecasts of departure demand are one of the driving inputs to tactical decision-support tools (DSTs) for airport surface traffic. While there are well-known results on average- or worst-case forecast uncertainty, it is the forecast errors which occur under best-case minimum-uncertainty conditions which constrain robust DST design and the achievable traffic benefits. These best-case errors have never previously been characterized. Several quantitative models and techniques for computing pushback forecasts are developed. These are tested against a dataset of 17,344 real-world airline ground operations covering 3 months of Lufthansa flights transiting Frankfurt International Airport. The Lufthansa dataset includes detailed timing information on all of the turn processes, including deboarding, catering, cleaning, fueling and boarding. The dataset is carefully filtered to obtain a sample of 3820 minimum-uncertainty ground events. The forecast models and techniques are tested against this sample, and it is observed that current pushback forecast errors (on the order of ±15min) cannot be reduced by a factor of more than 2 or 3. Furthermore, for each ground event, only 3 observations are necessary to achieve this best-case performance: the available ground-time between actual onblock and scheduled offblock; the time until deboarding begins; and the time until boarding ends. Any DST used in real-world operations must be robust to this "noise floor". To support the development of robust DSTs, a unified framework called ceno-scale modelling is developed.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) This class of models encodes a wide range of observed delay mechanisms using multi-resource synchronization (MRS) feedback networks. A ceno-scale model instance is created for Newark International Airport, and the parameter sensitivity and model fidelity are tested against a detailed real-world dataset. Based on the validated model framework, several robust dual control strategies are proposed for airport surface traffic.</dc:description><dc:description>by Francis R.

Coherent scattering from a collection of small dielectric spheroids populating a dense medium is compared to scattering from a homogeneous sphere. A Method of Moments (MoM) solution is adopted which accounts for spheroid-spheroid interactions directly. Coherent scattering results from these collections are compared to Mie scattering and the effective permittivity of the dense medium is obtained. Results are in good agreement to the classical mixing formula and this lends credibility to both models. In order to reduce memory requirements and computational complexity, the Sparse Matrix/Canonical Grid (SMCG) method is applied to 3-D dense media scattering. By approximating the dyadic Green's function about a canonical rectilinear grid, weak interaction between spheroid far apart may be quickly approximated. Strong interactions between dielectric spheroid in close proximity are still calculated directly. Weak interactions are quickly evaluated using a novel multilevel block-Toeplitz matrix vector multiply based on the Fast Fourier Transform.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) Electromagnetic induction (EMI) models of conducting and permeable spheroids under time harmonic excitation are refined to produce the broadband response with high dependability. A hybrid method is constructed consisting of three different approaches: 1) at low frequencies, the formally exact (but truncated) solution is applied, 2) at moderate frequencies, asymptotic expansions of the spheroidal wave functions (SWFs) are employed, 3) and at high, but still magnetoquasistatic, frequencies, a Small Penetration Approximation is borrowed. The combined EMI response is accurate except near a switchover point where there is typically less than a two percent error. Results are compared to data from a set of 17 steel and aluminum machined spheroids taken by the GEM-3 instrument and found to be in excellent agreement. Asymptotic expressions of the SWFs are found to depend on branch points and associated characteristic eigenvalues of the spheroidal wave equation. These branch points are found using polynomial estimation techniques and a quadruple precision Newton-Rhapson search method. Branch points for (n - m) =/&lt; 100 are found in greater accuracy than previously available and many are tabulated in this thesis. The solution for the induced magnetic field from multiple permeable and conducting spheroidal objects in close proximity under time harmonic excitation is presented. Interactions between spheroids is accounted for by a interspheroidal modal interaction matrix. This multibody solution may provide the basis for a forward model used by inversion routines designed to detect and discriminate UXO. Specifically, this multibody solution may help to isolate non-UXO clutter from actual UXO in the field.</dc:description><dc:description>by Benjamin Earl Barrowes.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

(Pablo Manuel), 1971-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</dc:subject><dc:description>Machine vision systems are used in a wide range of applications such as security, automated quality control and intelligent transportation systems. Several of these systems need to extract information from natural scenes in the section of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to humans. These scenes can easily have intra-frame illumination ratios in excess of 10⁶ : 1. Solid-state image sensors that can correctly process wide illumination dynamic range scenes are therefore required to ensure correct reliability and performance. This thesis describes a new algorithm to linearly increase the illumination dynamic range of integrating-type image sensors. A user-defined integration time is taken as a reference to create a potentially large set of integration intervals of different duration (the selected integration time being the longest) but with a common end. The light intensity received by each pixel in the sensing array is used to choose the optimal integration interval from the set, while a pixel saturation predictive decision is used to overlap the integration intervals within the given integration time such that only one frame using the optimal integration interval for each pixel is produced. The total integration time is never exceeded. Benefits from this approach are motion minimization, real-time operation, reduced memory requirements, programmable light intensity dynamic range increase and access to incremental light intensity information during the integration time.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The algorithm is fully described with special attention to the resulting sensor transfer function, the signal-to-noise ratio, characterization of types and effects of errors in the predictive decision, calculation of the optimal integration intervals set given a certain set size, calculation of the optimal number of integration intervals, and impact of the new algorithm to image data compression. An efficient mapping of this algorithm to a CMOS process was done by designing a proof-of-concept integrated circuit in a 0.18[mu]m 1.8V 5-metal layer process. The major components of the chip are a 1/3" VGA (640 x 480) pixel array, a 4bit per pixel memory array, an integration controller array and an analog-to-digital converter/correlated double sampled (ADC/CDS) array. Supporting components include pixel and memory row decoders, memory and converter output digital multiplexers, pixel-to-ADC/CDS analog multiplexer and test structures. The pixels have a fill factor of nearly 50%, as most of the needed system additions and complexity were taken off-pixel. The prototype is fully functional and linearly expands the dynamic range by more than 60dB.</dc:description><dc:description>by Pablo M. Acosta-Serafini.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

(Charles Kasimer)</dc:creator><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</dc:subject><dc:description>Traditionally, statistical signal processing algorithms are developed from probabilistic models for data. The design of the algorithms and their ultimate performance depend upon these assumed models. In certain situations, collecting or processing all available measurements may be inefficient or prohibitively costly. A potential technique to cope with such situations is data selection, where a subset of the measurements that can be collected and processed in a cost-effective manner is used as input to the signal processing algorithm. Careful evaluation of the selection procedure is important, since the probabilistic description of distinct data subsets can vary significantly. An algorithm designed for the probabilistic description of a poorly chosen data subset can lose much of the potential performance available to a well-chosen subset. This thesis considers algorithms for data selection combined with binary hypothesis testing. We develop models for data selection in several cases, considering both random and deterministic approaches. Our considerations are divided into two classes depending upon the amount of information available about the competing hypotheses. In the first class, the target signal is precisely known, and data selection is done deterministically. In the second class, the target signal belongs to a large class of random signals, selection is performed randomly, and semi-parametric detectors are developed.</dc:description><dc:description>by Charles K.

However, since no such naturally occurring materials were known, Veselago's work laid dormant for nearly 30 years. Recently though, a composite material, also known as a metamaterial, consisting of the periodic arrangement of metallic rods and split-rings has been shown to exhibit left-handed properties. Because the dimension of the rods and rings that makeup the metamaterial are small compared to the wavelength of interest, it is possible to approximately describe their bulk electromagnetic properties using an effective permittivity and an effective permeability. In this thesis, the properties and potential applications of LH media are explored. In addition, various tools are presented for the purpose of characterizing metamaterial designs. Before studying their metamaterial realization, the basic properties of propagation, radiation, and scattering through homogeneous LH media are studied. Many of the basic properties of LH media are in contrast to those typically encountered in right-handed media. For example, using a rigorous plane wave analysis of propagation and transmission into a dispersive LH medium from a RH medium, it is shown that power refracts at a negative angle, without violating causality. Second, the perfect lens concept is studied through a Green's function analysis. It is shown that under the perfect lens requirement, that a single source outside a LH media slab will generate two perfect images.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) Interestingly though, the time-averaged power flow inside the slab forms a sink. However, it is shown that while the introduction of loss eliminates this behavior, the lens becomes imperfect. It is seen that even a small amount of loss can destroy the imaging properties of the LH media lens. In terms of scattering, the Mie solution for plane wave scattering by a LH medium sphere is examined. It is shown that where applicable, care must be taken in choosing the appropriate algebraic signs of the wavenumbers in the evaluation of the Mie coefficients. In addition, it is then shown that a sphere composed of a LH medium will focus incoming energy into a spot inside the sphere. Finally, because the metamaterials studied in this thesis are anisostropic, the effects of aniostropy on reflection and transmission are examined. Next, various tools for understanding and characterizing left-handed metamaterials are presented. First, the accuracy of approximate analytic models of the rods and split-rings is investigated by using two-dimensional FD-TD simulations to compare transmission characteristics. It is shown that the rods tend to agree more favorably with their analytic model than the split-rings do. Next, in order to better understand the behavior of the rods and rings separately, numerical simulations of rods (or rings) embedded in homogeneous mag- netic (or electric) plasma media were performed. Using the transmission characteristics, it is shown that in order to obtained left-handed features, the plasma in the immediate vicinity of the rods or rings needed to be removed, ...</dc:description><dc:description>by Joe Pacheco, Jr.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

(Michael James), 1975-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</dc:subject><dc:description>Satellite and wireless networks operate over time varying channels that depend on attenuation conditions, power allocation decisions, and inter-channel interference. In order to reliably integrate these systems into a high speed data network and meet the increasing demand for high throughput and low delay, it is necessary to develop efficient network layer strategies that fully utilize the physical layer capabilities of each network element. In this thesis, we develop the notion of network layer capacity and describe capacity achieving power allocation and routing algorithms for general networks with wireless links and adaptive transmission rates. Fundamental issues of delay, throughput optimality, fairness, implementation complexity, and robustness to time varying channel conditions and changing user demands are discussed. Analysis is performed at the packet level and fully considers the queueing dynamics in systems with arbitrary, potentially bursty, arrival processes. Applications of this research are examined for the specific cases of satellite networks and ad-hoc wireless networks. Indeed, in Chapter 3 we consider a multi-beam satellite downlink and develop a dynamic power allocation algorithm that allocates power to each link in reaction to queue backlog and current channel conditions. The algorithm operates without knowledge of the arriving traffic or channel statistics, and is shown to achieve maximum throughput while maintaining average delay guarantees. At the end of Chapter 4, a crosslinked collection of such satellites is considered and a satellite separation principle is developed, demonstrating that joint optimal control can be implemented with separate algorithms for the downlinks and crosslinks.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) Ad-hoc wireless networks are given special attention in Chapter 6. A simple cell- partitioned model for a mobile ad-hoc network with N users is constructed, and exact expressions for capacity and delay are derived. End-to-end delay is shown to be O(N), and hence grows large as the size of the network is increased. To reduce delay, a transmission protocol which sends redundant packet information over multiple paths is developed and shown to provide O(vN) delay at the cost of reducing throughput. A fundamental rate- delay tradeoff curve is established, and the given protocols for achieving O(N) and O(vN) delay are shown to operate on distinct boundary points of this curve. In Chapters 4 and 5 we consider optimal control for a general time-varying network. A cross-layer strategy is developed that stabilizes the network whenever possible, and makes fair decisions about which data to serve when inputs exceed capacity. The strategy is decoupled into separate algorithms for dynamic flow control, power allocation, and routing, and allows for each user to make greedy decisions independent of the actions of others. The combined strategy is shown to yield data rates that are arbitrarily close to the optimally fair operating point that is achieved when all network controllers are coordinated and have perfect knowledge of future events. The cost of approaching this fair operating point is an end-to-end delay increase for data that is served by the network.</dc:description><dc:description>by Michael J.

At present, there are two Triple β-Spiral structures with solved crystallographic coordinates - one from Adenovirus and the other from Reovirus. There is evidence that the fold also occurs in Bacteriophage SF6. In this thesis, we present a computational analysis of the Triple β-Spiral fold. Our goal is to discover new instances of the fold in protein sequence databases. In Chapter 2, we present a series of sequence-based methods for the discovery of the fold. The final method in this Chapter is an iterative profile-based search that outperforms existing sequence-based algorithms. In Chapter 3, we introduce specific knowledge of the protein's structure into our prediction algorithms. Although this additional information does not improve the profile-based methods in Chapter 2, it does provide insight into the important forces that drive the Triple β-Spiral folding process. In Chapter 4, we employ logistic regression to integrate the score information from the previous Chapter into a single unified framework. This framework outperforms all previous methods in cross-validation tests. We do not discover a great number of additional instances of the Triple β-Spiral fold outside of the Adenovirus and Reovirus families. The results of our profile based templates and score integration tools, however, suggest that these methods might well succeed for other protein structures.</dc:description><dc:description>by Eben Louis Scanlon.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; and, (M.B.A.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 118-125).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

The RNA polymerase arrival rate (PAR) is defined to be the rate that RNA polymerases arrive at a specified location on the DNA. Designing and characterizing biological modules in terms of RNA polymerase arrival rates provides for many advantages in the construction and modeling of biological systems. PARMESAN is an in vitro method for measuring polymerase arrival rates using pyrrolo-dC, a fluorescent DNA base that can substitute for cytosine. Pyrrolo-dC shows a detectable fluorescence difference when in single-stranded versus double-stranded DNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase separates the two strands of DNA, leading to a change in the fluorescence of pyrrolo-dC. By incorporating pyrrolo-dC at specific locations in the DNA, fluorescence changes can be taken as a direct measurement of the polymerase arrival rate.</dc:description><dc:description>by Austin Che.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, February 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 87-100).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

Along with other types of labor market intermediaries (LMIs), One-Stop Career Centers have arisen as sites of organizational and institutional innovation in mediating the labor matching process. However, compared to other LMIs, much less is known about career centers' employment brokering operations. This study helps address this research gap by providing a detailed analysis of three career centers. This investigation answers three research questions related to the 1) functions; 2) adaptation; and 3) performance of career centers with differing organizational sponsorships. In doing so, the study develops a conceptual framework based on three strategic orientations-community, bureaucratic, and entrepreneurial-that helps to clarify and categorize organizational processes, change, and outcomes.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The study finds that different strategic orientations are related to variation in organizational planning, practice, networks, and performance. Strategic orientation is also found to influence organizational adaptability during both a tight labor market and an economic recession, as well as during implementation of major federal policy changes related to welfare reform and workforce development reform. The study contributes to scholarship on employment brokering and labor market institutional change by offering an empirical analysis and theoretical framework that highlights the emergent role of One-Stop Career Centers as publicly-funded labor market intermediaries. The study is also immediately relevant to policymakers and practitioners involved in the more than 1,900 career centers across the country. For them, this study provides a better understanding of the programmatic trade-offs associated with career center operations and therefore may help them improve the labor matching process for both employers and job-seekers--especially those with barriers to employment.</dc:description><dc:description>by Joaquín Herranz, Jr.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The downtown journey to work is already recognized as a successful niche for transit. This thesis seeks to identify non-work travel markets with strong ridership potential. Nationwide data sources indicate that about half of all transit trips in the largest US cities are non-work trips, and that non-work travel has contributed to transit ridership growth in 13 of 20 large US cities. Based on these findings, St. Louis and Chicago are selected as cases for further analysis. St. Louis is the successful case, in which non-work travel contributed to overall ridership growth in the 1990's. Chicago is the baseline case, in which overall ridership declined in the 1990's, with no evidence of growth in non-work ridership. Detailed case studies of St. Louis and Chicago are conducted. First, an overview is presented, providing a description of transit routes; a profile of transit riders; and an understanding of recent ridership changes. Next, non-work ridership markets are identified, based on original analysis of travel survey data and off-peak ridership data. Finally, the characteristics of those markets are reviewed, based on secondary sources, press articles, and existing market research. This is done in order to evaluate the benefits of providing transit service to each market, and the effectiveness of current transit service to each market. Five non-work travel markets are identified in the case studies as strong sources of ridership.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) These markets are: tourists; large events; shopping; younger adults without children, living in urban areas; and people who prefer not to own cars. To pursue non-work ridership growth, transit agencies must be proactive about improving service to meet the unique needs of these markets. Doing so can yield a variety of social, political, and economic benefits for the transit agency, transit riders, and the general public. In conclusion, recommendations are offered for effective transit service to each non-work travel market. General recommendations are offered, as well as specific applications to the Chicago Transit Authority and to Tren Urbano in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</dc:description><dc:description>by Alexander Nobler Cohen.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.C.P.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 195-201).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

Program in Media Arts and Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:description>Spoken language, in addition to serving as a primary vehicle for externalizing linguistic structures and meaning, acts as a carrier of various sources of information, including back- ground, age, gender, membership in social structures, as well as physiological, pathological and emotional states. These sources of information are more than just ancillary to the main purpose of linguistic communication: Humans react to the various non-linguistic factors en- coded in the speech signal, shaping and adjusting their interactions to satisfy interpersonal and social protocols. Computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics have devoted much active research to systems that aim to model the production and recovery of linguistic lexico-semantic structures from speech. However, less attention has been devoted to systems that model and understand the paralinguistic and extralinguistic information in the signal. As the breadth and nature of human-computer interaction escalates to levels previously reserved for human-to-human communication, there is a growing need to endow computational systems with human-like abilities which facilitate the interaction and make it more natural. Of paramount importance amongst these is the human ability to make inferences regarding the affective content of our exchanges. This thesis proposes a framework for the recognition of affective qualifiers from prosodic- acoustic parameters extracted from spoken language.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) It is argued that modeling the affective prosodic variation of speech can be approached by integrating acoustic parameters from various prosodic time scales, summarizing information from more localized (e.g., syllable level) to more global prosodic phenomena (e.g., utterance level). In this framework speech is structurally modeled as a dynamically evolving hierarchical model in which levels of the hierarchy are determined by prosodic constituency and contain parameters that evolve according to dynamical systems. The acoustic parameters have been chosen to reflect four main components of speech thought to reflect paralinguistic and affect-specific information: intonation, loudness, rhythm and voice quality. The thesis addresses the contribution of each of these components separately, and evaluates the full model by testing it on datasets of acted and of spontaneous speech perceptually annotated with affective labels, and by comparing it against human performance benchmarks.</dc:description><dc:description>by Raul Fernandez.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Program in Media Arts and Sciences.</dc:subject><dc:description>Knowledge of how groups of people interact is important in many disciplines, e.g. organizational behavior, social network analysis, knowledge management and ubiquitous computing. Existing studies of social network interactions have either been restricted to online communities, where unambiguous measurements about how people interact can be obtained (available from chat and email logs), or have been forced to rely on questionnaires, surveys or diaries to get data on face-to-face interactions between people. The aim of this thesis is to automatically model face-to-face interactions within a community. The first challenge was to collect rich and unbiased sensor data of natural interactions. The "sociometer", a specially designed wearable sensor package, was built to address this problem by unobtrusively measuring face-to-face interactions between people. Using the sociometers, 1518 hours of wearable sensor data from 23 individuals was collected over a two-week period (66 hours per person). This thesis develops a computational framework for learning the interaction structure and dynamics automatically from the sociometer data. Low-level sensor data are transformed into measures that can be used to learn socially relevant aspects of people's interactions - e.g. identifying when people are talking and whom they are talking to. The network structure is learned from the patterns of communication among people. The dynamics of a person's interactions, and how one person's dynamics affects the other's style of interaction are also modeled. Finally, a person's style of interaction is related to the person's role within the network. The algorithms are evaluated by comparing the output against hand-labeled and survey data.</dc:description><dc:description>by Tanzeem Khalid Choudhury.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Four point DC conductivity measurements were made from 1 atm to 1018 atm p02 over isotherms ranging from 600-1 000Ê»C in materials containing 0-20% Pr. A pO02-dependent ionic conductivity was observed at high pO2 values in compositions containing 0.5% and 1% Pr. This behavior was attributed to oxidation of Pr3+ to Pr4+ under oxidizing conditions, thereby decreasing the concentration of acceptor dopants in the PCO material. In compositions containing 10% and 20% Pr, an electron hopping conductivity was observed at high pO02 values. This contribution was strongest at low temperatures and was attributed to the formation of a praseodymium impurity band within the CeO2 band gap. Defect association significantly altered the predicted pO2 dependence of the impurity band conductivity, especially at low temperatures. The temperature dependences of the thermodynamic parameters governing defect formation and transport in PCO were determined. The reduction enthalpy of cerium was significantly decreased with additions of Pr from approximately 4.7 eV (the value in pure CeO2) to 3.4 eV in 20% PCO. The energy between the Pr impurity band and the CeO2 conduction band was approximately 0.95 eV for 10% and 20% PCO samples. The measured trap depth was significantly higher (approximately 1.6 eV) in 0.5% and 1% PCO. The migration enthalpy for impurity band hopping conductivity was approximately 0.55 eV, slightly higher than the hopping enthalpy for intrinsic carriers in CeO2 (0.4 eV).</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The oxygen ion migration enthalpy measured for most samples was approximately 0.6- 0.7 eV, in agreement with values determined for other rare-earth doped systems. At 20% Pr, the total migration energy increased to approximately 0.9 eV. This increase was attributed to an association energy at high doping levels. Coulometric titration and points to the possible existence of uncharged oxygen vacancies, particularly at low temperatures. During the course of these experiments, it became evident that the mechanical stability of PCO needs to be addressed if the material is to be used in real applications. Oxygen uptake/evolution during reduction/oxidation cycles appears to result in development of significant stresses and cracking. While the material may be useful in powder form, this cracking issue must be addressed if it is to be used in bulk or thin film form.</dc:description><dc:description>by Todd Stanley Stefanik.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

This technique is capable of extracting mechanical properties accurately down to nanometers, via rigorous interpretation of indentation response. Such interpretation requires fundamental understandings of contact mechanics and underlying deformation mechanisms. Analytical, computational and experimental approaches are utilized to elucidate specifically how empirical constitutive relation can be estimated from the complex multiaxial stress state induced by indentation. Analytical formulations form a framework for parametric finite element analysis. The algorithms are established to predict indentation response from a constitutive relation (hereafter referred to as "forward algorithms") and to extract mechanical properties from indentation curve (hereafter referred to as "reverse algorithms"). Experimental verifications and comprehensive sensitivity analysis are conducted. Similar approaches are undertaken to extend the forward/reverse algorithms to indentations using two ore more tip geometries. Microstructural miniaturization leads to novel class of materials with a grain size smaller than 100 nm, hereafter referred to as "nanocrystalline" material. Its mechanical properties are observed to deviate greatly from the microcrystalline counterparts.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) In this thesis, experimental, analytical and computational approaches are utilized to elucidate the rate and size dependent mechanical properties observed in nanocrystalline materials. Indentations, as well as micro-tensile tests, are employed to attain various controllable deformation rates. A simple analytical model, hereafter referred to as Grain-Boundary-Affected-Zone (GBAZ) model, is proposed to rationalize possible rate-sensitivity mechanism. Systematic finite element analysis integrating GBAZ model is conducted with calibration against the experiments. The same GBAZ model, further utilized in the parametric finite element study, is capable of predicting the inverse Hall-Petch-type phenomenon (weakening with decreasing grain size) at the range consistent with the literature.</dc:description><dc:description>by Nuwong Chollacoop.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Understanding the formation and evolution of such interfaces is therefore essential for the better design and optimization of these technologies. In this thesis, a methodology for the study of the thermochemical interactions at ceramic/metal interfaces, during both their formation and evolution, is proposed. Because of the importance of zirconia-based ceramics in increasingly important applications such as structural composites, thermal barrier coatings and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, it was decided to illustrate the concepts developed in this thesis through the study of the interactions between zirconias and active metals. Semi-empirical thermodynamic models of all the phases likely to take part in the ceramic/metal interfacial interactions studied were developed. Phase diagram data and thermochemical information were critically assessed and use to adjust the thermodynamic parameters that allowed the description of the Ag-Cu-Ti, Cu-Ti-Zr, Ti-Zr-O, Cu-Ti-O and Cu-Zr-O systems. The thermodynamic models were used to predict the diffusion paths across zirconia/active metal interfaces through metastable phase diagrams calculations. Additionally, equilibrium calculations of activity diagrams were used to understand the complex interfacial reactions occurring during the active metal brazing of zirconia-based ceramics.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) By using simple one-dimensional interdiffusion simulations, it was demonstrated that the base metal in ceramic/metal joints plays an essential role in determine the thermochemical interactions at the ceramic/metal interface during ceramic/metal joining operations. In general it was found that, using all these techniques,it was possible to explain diffusion paths and reaction sequences observed in a great number of zirconia/active-metal systems, both in the solid and in the liquid states. In many cases, the morphology of the reaction layers formed at ceramic/metal interfaces determine their final properties. To address this problem, empirical thermodynamic models of the likely reaction products at zirconia/metal interfaces were coupled to kinetic models using the diffuse-interface formalism to successfully describe the formation and evolution of complex ceramic/metal interfacial structures.</dc:description><dc:description>by Raymundo Arróyave.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The success of 3DP as an alternative manufacturing technology to bulk machining of materials for complex parts has been demonstrated. By proof of concept, 3DP has demonstrated the ability to create parts with Local Control of the Composition (LCC). LCC allows tailoring the material properties in regions of a part for functional purposes. In this work, LCC was studied and demonstrated by fabricating bimetallic bars consisting of two layers of Fe-Ni alloys with different composition and, hence, different thermal expansion properties; the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of Fe-Ni system is sensitive to its composition. Two types of the binder/dopant slurries were made for making the LCC bars. One type consisted of dispersions of Fe₂O₃ particles in water, and the other consisted of dispersion of NiO in water. The LCC bars were successfully made by printing the Fe₂O₃/NiO slurries into Fe-30Ni base powders. After heat treatment to impart strength to the printed bars, the bars were successfully retrieved from unbound powders. The bars, then, were annealed at 1400 ⁰C for 2 hours for sintering and homogenization. The final composition of the base powders were changed accordingly. In the layers on which an Fe₂O₃ slurry was printed, the Fe composition of the layers increased on average to 72wt%. Similarly, the Ni composition of the Ni-enriched layers of the bars increased on average to 33wt%. The densification and local homogenization resulting from reduction and sintering treatments were not satisfactory.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The major problem was presumably caused by the oxide residues. The presence of the oxide powders was evident from the microprobe measurement. The oxide residues caused the local compositions to be inhomogeneous. As a result, the compositional profiles showed considerable scatter. Moreover, the residues impeded the sintering rate of the bars; the sintering densities of the bars were as small as 78% of the theoretical density. The resulting bimetallic bars did exhibit bending deflection on uniform heating. However, the bending deflections were much smaller than expected. Evidently, the compositional profiles of the bars critically influence their thermal bending properties. The scatter in the compositional profiles resulted in local variations of CTE in the bars, which degraded the thermal bending properties. A linear elastic model that allows prediction of the deflection as a function of composition profile shows good agreement with the observed deflections in the bimetallic bars with LCC.</dc:description><dc:description>by Ratchatee Techapiesancharoenkij.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 106-107).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

(Aaron Chunghin), 1978-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Civil and Environmental Engineering.</dc:subject><dc:description>Experiments are performed where a dense multiphase plume is released vertically in a salinity stratified ambient. The constituent phase composition of the initial buoyancy flux can be dense brine, particles, or a mixture of the two in a prescribed ratio. The resulting trapping heights and peeling depths are recorded by visual acquisition and from dye fluorescence measurements. Also, the radial concentration distribution of the dispersed phase after the first peeling event is obtained by collecting the settled particles from the bottom of the tank. Analytical models assuming plug flow and well-mixed particle distributions within the intrusion layer are used to predict the spread of the particle distribution based on initial buoyancy flux, momentum flux, stratification parameter and particle fall velocity. The effects of initial momentum and volume flux on peel and trap depths were studied by comparing the predictions from these models. Finally the observed results are compared to a single-phase plume numerical prediction (CORMIX) and a multiphase numerical plume model. Observed peeling depths were not sensitive to buoyancy composition, while observed trap depths decreased slightly with high particle fractions, possibly from the 'lift-off' phenomenon where particle fallout decreases the bulk buoyancy of the intrusion layer. The observed radial distribution was Gaussian, consistent with particles being vertially well mixed in the intrusion layer, and the standard deviation agreed well with predictions.</dc:description><dc:description>by Aaron C.

A polyomino is any connected shape formed from a union of grid cells, and a tiling of a region is a collection of polyominoes lying in the region such that each square is covered exactly once. In particular, we focus on two main themes: local connectivity and tile invariants. Given a set of tiles T and a finite set L of local replacement moves, we say that a region [Delta] has local connectivity with respect to T and L if it is possible to convert any tiling of [Delta] into any other by means of these moves. If R is a set of regions (such as the set of all simply connected regions), then we say there is a local move property for T and R if there exists a finite set of moves L such that every r in R has local connectivity with respect to T and L. We use height function techniques to prove local move properties for several new tile sets. In addition, we provide explicit counterexamples to show the absence of a local move property for a number of tile sets where local move properties were conjectured to hold. We also provide several new results concerning tile invariants. If we let ai(t) denote the number of occurrences of the tile ti in a tiling t of a region [Delta], then a tile invariant is a linear combination of the ai's whose value depends only on t and not on r.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) We modify the boundary-word technique of Conway and Lagarias to prove tile invariants for several new sets of tiles and provide specific examples to show that the invariants we obtain are the best possible. In addition, we prove some new enumerative results, relating certain tiling problems to Baxter permutations, the Tutte polynomial, and alternating-sign matrices.</dc:description><dc:description>by Michael Robert Korn.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Our first result is that the joint distribution of the pair of statistics 'number of fixed points' and 'number of excedances' is the same in 321-avoiding as in 132-avoiding permutations. This generalizes a recent result of Robertson, Saracino and Zeilberger, for which we also give another, more direct proof. The key ideas are to introduce a new class of statistics on Dyck paths, based on what we call a tunnel, and to use a new technique involving diagonals of non-rational generating functions. Next we present a new statistic-preserving family of bijections from the set of Dyck paths to itself. They map statistics that appear in the study of pattern-avoiding permutations into classical statistics on Dyck paths, whose distribution is easy to obtain. In particular, this gives a simple bijective proof of the equidistribution of fixed points in the above two sets of restricted permutations.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) Then we introduce a bijection between 321- and 132-avoiding permutations that preserves the number of fixed points and the number of excedances. A part of our bijection is based on the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. We also show that our bijection preserves additional parameters. Next, motivated by these results, we study the distribution of fixed points and excedances in permutations avoiding subsets of patterns of length 3. We solve all the cases of simultaneous avoidance of more than one pattern, giving generating functions which enumerate them. Some cases are generalized to patterns of arbitrary length. For avoidance of one single pattern we give partial results. We also describe the distribution of these statistics in involutions avoiding any subset of patterns of length 3. The main technique consists in using bijections between pattern-avoiding permutations and certain kinds of Dyck paths, in such a way that the statistics in permutations that we consider correspond to statistics on Dyck paths which are easier to enumerate. Finally, we study another kind of restricted permutations, counted by the Motzkin numbers. By constructing a bijection into Motzkin paths, we enumerate them with respect to some parameters, including the length of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences and the number of ascents.</dc:description><dc:description>by Sergi Elizalde.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Finding a formula for the signature of the Shapovalov form is a related problem which may be a necessary first step in such a classification. A Verma module may admit an invariant Hermitian form, which is unique up to multiplication by a real scalar when it exists. Suitably normalized, it is known as the Shapovalov form. The collection of highest weights decomposes under the affine Weyl group action into alcoves. The signature of the Shapovalov form for an irreducible Verma module depends only on the alcove in which the highest weight lies. We develop a formula for this signature, depending on the combinatorial structure of the affine Weyl group.</dc:description><dc:description>by Wai Ling Yee.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Donaldson and I. Smith aimed at using symplectic Lefschetz fibration techniques to obtain information about pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic 4-manifolds. Donaldson and Smith introduced an invariant DS which counts holomorphic sections of a relative Hilbert scheme constructed from a symplectic Lefschetz fibration, and a number of considerations, including a duality relation for DS proven by Smith, led to the conjecture that DS agrees with the Gromov invariant G[gamma] earlier defined by C. Taubes in his study of Seiberg-Witten theory on symplectic manifolds. Our central result is a proof of this conjecture, which thus makes available new proofs of some results concerning pseudoholomorphic curves which had previously only been accessible via gauge theory. The crucial technical ingredient in the proof is an argument which allows us to work with curves C in the total space of the Lefschetz fibration that are made holomorphic by an almost complex structure which is integrable near C and with respect to which the fibration is a pseudoholomorphic map. We also introduce certain refinements of DS and show that these refinements are equal to Gromov invariants which count pseudoholomorphic subvarieties of symplectic 4-manifolds with a prescribed decomposition into reducible components. We prove a vanishing result for some of these invariants which might bear on the question of the uniqueness of the decomposition of the canonical class of a symplectic 4-manifold into classes with nontrivial Gromov-Witten invariants.</dc:description><dc:description>by Michael Joseph Usher.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

We sh w that both are given by piecewise polynomial functions in the entries of the partitions and compositions parametrizing them, and that the domains of polynomiality form a complex of cones. Interesting factorization patterns are found in the polyomials giving the Kostka numbers. The case of A3 is studied more carefully and involves computer proofs. We relate the description of the domains of polynomiality for the weight multiplicity function to that of the domains for the Duistermaat-Heckman measure from symplectic geometry (a continuous analogue of the weight multiplicity function). As an easy consequence of this work, one obtains simple proofs of the fact the Kostka numbers, and Littlewood-Richardson numbers are given by polynomial functions in the nonnegative integer variable N. Both these results were known previously but have non-elementary proofs involving fermionic formulas for Kostka-Foulkes polynomials and semi-invariants of quivers. Also investigated is a new q-analogue of the Kostant partition function, which is shown to be given by polynomial functions over the relative interiors of the cells of a complex of cones.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) It arises in the work of Guillemin, Sternberg and Weitsman on quantization with respect to the signature Dirac operator, where they give a formula for the multiplicities of weights in representations associated to twisted signatures of coadjoint orbits which is very similar to the Kostant multiplicity formula, but involves the q = 2 specialization of this q-analogue. We give an algebraic proof of this results, find an analogue of the Steinberg formula for these representations and, in type A, find a branching rule which we can iterate to obtain an analogue of Gelfand-Tsetlin theory.</dc:description><dc:description>by Etienne Rassart.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The objective is to open a subset of facilities and connect each client to an open facility so that the total cost of opening facilities and connecting clients to facilities is minimized. As the UFLP is NP-hard, much effort has been devoted to designing approximation algorithms for it. As our main result, we introduce a method called dual fitting and use it in conjunction with factor-revealing programs to obtain improved approximation algorithms for the UFLP. Our best algorithm achieves an approximation factor of 1.52 (currently the best known factor) and runs in quasilinear time. We demonstrate the versatility of our techniques by using them to analyze the approximation factors of a cycle cover algorithm and a Steiner packing algorithm, as well as the competitive factor of an online buffer management algorithm. We also use our algorithms and other techniques to improve the approximation factors of several variants of the UFLP. In particular, we introduce the notion of bifactor approximate reductions and use it to derive a 2-approximation for the soft-capacitated FLP. Finally, we consider the UFLP in a game-theoretic setting and prove tight bounds on schemes for dividing up the cost of a solution among players. Our result combined with the scheme proposed by Pal and Tardos shows that 1/3 is the best possible approximation factor of any cross-monotonic cost-sharing scheme for the UFLP. Our proof uses a novel technique that we apply to several other optimization problems.</dc:description><dc:description>by Mohammad Mahdian.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

This research is motivated by the computer services industry, where services are provided mostly on a dedicated basis. However, leading computer companies such as HP and IBM forecast that external service providers will share resources between customers, in order to realize economies of scale. Two of the challenges faced by providers and consumers of shared services are admission control and pricing. In order to allow sellers to guarantee service levels, we recommend that pricing schemes for shared resources include admission controls. The implementation of such schemes requires understanding of buyers' and sellers' actions and a characterization of the admission control. This dissertation reviews the computer services supply-chain and proposes a five-step procedure for analyzing the pricing of shared services. Then it extends the usage of token-bucket and token-bucket-with-rate-control admission controls to pricing schemes. We show that for the token-bucket (token-bucket-with-rate-control) mechanism the bucket level behaves as a two- (one-) sided regulated random walk. Thus, the performance analysis (loss sales or backlog) is identical to the analysis of threshold crossing probabilities of regulated random walks. This dissertation's main contribution is an upper bound on the probability of a two-sided regulated random walk being on its "rare" boundary. Using the bounds developed, we solve constrained or relaxed versions of the buyer's problem. For the token-bucket-with-rate-control pricing scheme and exponential demand the buyer's problem can be solved in closed form.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) Moreover, numerical experiments show that the approximate solutions for the normal demand case are within 1% of optimal. Similar results hold for the token-bucket mechanism. Finally, we characterize the output stream of these admission controls (the jumps of one- or two-sided regulated random walks). We use a Brownian motion approximation for the bucket level process, but still consider the actual demand and arrival processes. Moreover, we enhance the performance of this approach by relating fill rates with the percentage of periods with losses. Numerical results show that in both mechanisms, when demand is exponential or normal, the approximated first two moments of the output stream are, typically, within the 99% confidence intervals.</dc:description><dc:description>by Opher Baron.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Based on a wealth of experimental results obtained from microcrystalline metals, where the grain size is typically greater than 1 um, it is widely recognized that an increase in grain size generally results in a reduction in the fatigue endurance limit. On the other hand, a coarser grain structure can lead to an increased fatigue threshold stress intensity factor range, as well as a decrease in the rate of fatigue crack propagation. The relevance of these trends to ultra-fine-crystalline metals (grain size between 100 nm and 1000 nm) and nanocrystalline metals (grain size less than 100 nm) is relatively unknown. Such lack of understanding is primarily a consequence of the paucity of experimental data on the fatigue response of metals with very fine grains. In this work, the fatigue behavior of electrodeposited, fully dense, nanocrystalline pure Ni, with average and total range of grain sizes well below 100 nm, was examined. The fatigue response of nanocrystalline Ni was also compared with that of ultra-fine-crystalline and microcrystalline Ni wherever appropriate. It was found that grain refinement to the nanocrystalline regime generally leads to an increase in resistance to failure under stress-controlled fatigue whereas a deleterious effect was seen on the resistance to fatigue crack growth. To explore the generality of the above trends, similar experiments were performed on additional ultra-fine-crystalline material systems, produced using alternate processing techniques such as cryomilling and equal channel angular pressing.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) Contact fatigue behavior was also examined down to the nanocrystalline grain size regime. Friction and damage evolution was monitored as a function of the number of unidirectional sliding contact fatigue cycles introduced at the surface of several material systems. Critical experiments were performed to isolate the effects of grain size and material strength. Over the range of materials investigated, strength rather than grain size dominated the contact fatigue response, with substantial improvements in strength resulting in reduced damage accumulation, and a lower steady state friction coefficient. Conversely, grain size was found to govern the rate of crack growth under mechanical fatigue, with all other structural factors approximately held fixed. In addition, the cyclic deformation behavior of nanocrystalline materials was also investigated. Experiments designed to extract the strain response at a constant range of imposed cyclic stresses provided the first evidence of cyclic hardening in a nanocrystalline material. This behavior was observed over a broad range of loading conditions and fatigue frequencies.</dc:description><dc:description>by Timothy Hanlon.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

These waste feed streams are very aggressive and pose material performance issues. As potential alloys in construction of SCWO systems, nickel-base alloys are tested. Corrosion in aqueous feed streams of ambient pH values of 2, 1 and 7 is studied both at supercritical (-425⁰C) and subcritical (-300-360⁰C) temperatures with a constant pressure of 24.1MPa. Dealloying of Ni and Fe, and oxidation of Cr and Mo are observed at subcritical temperatures at a pH value of 2. At a pH value of 1, even chromium is selectively dissolved and only molybdenum forms a stable oxide at the subcritical temperature. At supercritical temperatures, normal thin oxidation occurs at both pH values of pH 2 and 7. In contrast, in the neutral pH solution, dealloying is not observed at any temperature. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in acidic feed streams is observed both at the supercritical and subcritical temperatures. In order to understand the corrosion mechanisms, the chemistry of a feed stream, the formation of the dealloyed oxide layer, and the level of stress are investigated.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The suppression of dealloying at supercritical temperatures comes from the low proton concentration associated with the low dissociation constant of HCl and water. However, the growth rate of the dealloyed oxide layer at subcritical temperatures is very fast, which is primarily due to the dealloying and the high diffusivity of the nickel in this defective oxide layer. SCC at subcritical temperatures results from the dealloyed oxide layer formation along the grain boundary as intrusions, which act as a precursor to the crack initiation and propagation. SCC at the supercritical temperature is thought to result from the direct chemical attack of associated HC1 molecules. SCC is not observed in the neutral solution.</dc:description><dc:description>by Hojong Kim.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The first study details the developmental properties of dendritic spines, the principle sites of excitatory synaptic contacts, during a period of synaptogenesis in the developing mouse cortex. The second study extends these findings and examines the properties of dendritic spines during a period of heightened visual cortical plasticity and describes how manipulations of visual input alter these dendritic structures. The third and final study examines the distribution of glutamate receptors, which are key components of excitatory synaptic contacts, during a period of stereotyped anatomical plasticity in the developing ferret lateral geniculate nucleus. Each of these studies focus specifically on the interactions between neuronal structure and function, principally at the level of synaptic contacts. The conclusions of this thesis are that structure and function are intimately related and that altering one has important consequences for the other.</dc:description><dc:description>by Serkan Oray.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

The unwritten assumption is that there is something about Islam that makes it bloodier and more violence-prone than other religions. This dissertation seeks to investigate this assertion by considering incidents of Islamically motivated terrorism, violence, and war, and comparing them to examples of Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu bellicosity. In doing so, it aims to evaluate if religious violence is primarily the product of beliefs, doctrine and scripture, or if religious violence is the result of other factors such as cultural, political, social and economic circumstances. This dissertation focuses on religious wars--wars, terrorism, and violent conflicts that have saliently religious goals, specifically battles to defend holy nations, sacred spaces and revolutions aimed at creating religious governments-and tests three variables for their ability to explain the conditions under which religious wars arise: threat perception, the intertwining of political and religious authority, and the amount of resources available to a given religious group.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) It argues that religious violence is the result of specific interpretations of a religion's beliefs and scriptures, not the religions per se, and that violent interpretations of a religion are the product of individuals-usually religious leaders-who are grounded in specific circumstances. Therefore, in order to understand the conditions under which these violent interpretations of a religion occur, one needs to identify, first, who is interpreting the religion and by what authority; second, the social, political and economic circumstances surrounding these violent interpretations; and third, the believability of these interpretations by members of religious communities.</dc:description><dc:description>by Heather Selma Gregg.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Several explanations are considered, but a series of interviews and a review of events during the 1996-2003 timeframe yield an explanation that points to bureaucratic politics and status dynamics as the most likely cause. In particular, the paper finds that the Coast Guard's low status (vis-à-vis other organizations within the Department of Transportation) combined with the Deepwater community's high status (vis-à-vis other communities within the Coast Guard) to produce a political environment that made the use of a systems approach almost inevitable.

The radioactive waste created in the once through nuclear fuel cycle has to be isolated from the environment for thousands of years. In addition, plutonium and other actinides, after the decay of fission products, could become targets for weapon proliferators. Furthermore, only a small fraction of the energy potential in the fuel is being used. All these concerns can be addressed if a closed fuel cycle strategy is considered offering the possibility for partitioning and transmutation of long lived radioactive waste, enhanced proliferation resistance, and improved utilization of natural resources. It is generally believed that dedicated advanced reactor systems have to be designed in order to perform the task of nuclear waste transmutation effectively. The development and deployment of such innovative systems is technically and economically challenging. In this thesis, a possibility of constraining the generation of long lived radioactive waste through multi-recycling of Trans-uranic actinides (TRU) in existing Light Water Reactors (LWR has been studied. Thorium based and fertile free fuels (FFF) were analyzed as the most attractive candidates for TRU burning in LWRs. Although both fuel types can destroy TRU at comparable rates (about 1150 kg/GWe-Year in FFF and up to 900 kg/GWe-Year in Th) and achieve comparable fractional TRU burnup (close to 50a/o), the Th fuel requires significantly higher neutron moderation than practically feasible in a typical LWR lattice to achieve such performance.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) On the other hand, the FFF exhibits nearly optimal TRU destruction performance in a typical LWR fuel lattice geometry. Increased TRU presence in LWR core leads to neutron spectrum hardening, which results in reduced control materials reactivity worth. The magnitude of this reduction is directly related to the amount of TRU in the core. A potential for positive void reactivity feedback limits the maximum TRU loading. Th and conventional mixed oxide (MOX) fuels require higher than FFF TRU loading to sustain a standard 18 fuel cycle length due to neutron captures in Th232 and U238 respectively. Therefore, TRU containing Th and U cores have lower control materials worth and greater potential for a positive void coefficient than FFF core. However, the significantly reduced fuel Doppler coefficient of the fully FFF loaded core and the lower delayed neutron fraction lead to questions about the FFF performance in reactivity initiated accidents. The Combined Non-Fertile and UO2 (CONFU) assembly concept is proposed for multi- recycling of TRU in existing PWRs. The assembly assumes a heterogeneous structure where about 20% of the UO2 fuel pins on the assembly periphery are replaced with FFF pins hosting TRU generated in the previous cycle. The possibility of achieving zero TRU net is demonstrated. The concept takes advantage of superior TRU destruction performance in FFF allowing minimization of TRU inventory. At the same time, the core physics is still dominated by UO2 fuel allowing maintenance of core safety and control characteristics comparable to all-UO2.</dc:description><dc:description>by Evgeni Shwageraus.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Most countries currently have no long-term disposal strategy in place. Therefore, the concept of an intermediate nuclear spent fuel storage facility has been introduced as a method of temporarily storing the spent fuel in a central location until long-term disposal of the spent nuclear fuel is made available. General criteria that can be used to compare potential international sites for an intermediate nuclear spent fuel storage facility have been identified and elucidated. Those criteria were then utilized to compare four potential international intermediate nuclear spent fuel storage facility (IINSFSF) sites. Two of the sites are in Russia (one in the area of the old nuclear city of Krasnoyarsk-26 currently known as Zheleznogorsk and one on Sakhalin Island in the area of the town of Kholmsk), one is in China (in the area of the town of Xilinhot in the Nei Mongol province) and one in Australia (in the area of the city of Meekatharra in Western Australia). Safety and safeguard regulations for nuclear facilities were reviewed and appropriate portions that could be applied to a potential IINSFSF are recommended. An analysis was conducted to determine legal issues pertinent to an IINSFSF and a brief, limited overview of the most important legal issues is presented. The effects that nuclear fuels subjected to higher burnups (than practiced now) will have on dry cask storage was examined and recommendations for storage strategies are proposed.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The selected criteria involve the areas of Geological Suitability, Seismic Stability, Land Area Suitability, Site Infrastructure Suitability, Transportation Infrastructure Suitability, Meteorological Suitability, Willingness of the Host Nation and Population Density. Application of the criteria to the suggested sites revealed that Krasnoyarsk - 26 is the best alternative. This is mainly due to the willingness of the host nation of Russia to accept this type of facility. Krasnoyarsk - 26 also rates as the best site with respect to the criteria of geological suitability and seismic suitability. Without consideration for the willingness of the host nation, Meekatharra would be the ideal site. Xilinhot was evaluated as the third best alternative followed by the Sakhalin Island site of Kholmsk. The legal issue that would be of most concern to an IINSFSF would be potential liability. It would be best if the host nation were a signatory of an international treaty limiting the liability of the IINSFSF operator. Of the two major international nuclear liability treaties in existence the one preferable is the Paris Convention. Economics are driving nuclear power plants in the United States to look to implement more highly enriched fuels to achieve higher burnupsHow these higher burnup spent fuels will affect dry cask storage of spent fuels at reactor sites should be examined. To determine this, the decay heat output of higher burnup spent fuels was compared to the storage capacity of a typical dry cask storage system ...</dc:description><dc:description>by Joe Burns.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Engineering, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references.</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

The minor incidents dealt with in this thesis include non- safety related component failure, equipment maintenance, inspection or testing. MIDAS implements the risk-informed decision analysis methodology that uses multi- attribute utility theory (MAUT) and formal decision-making models that was developed for nuclear power plants. MIDAS integrates the theory, practical models and the graphical user interfaces for analysts to quickly obtain the insight regarding the performance of decision options and driving factors. To be able to deal with the inherent diversity of scenarios and decision options, a well-defined option models and modular calculation structure were constructed in MIDAS. In addition, MIDAS provides the functions of performing sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to take into account the inherent model and parameter uncertainties in decision option evaluation. Two case studies are performed to demonstrate the application of MIDAS in nuclear power plant risk-informed incident management. The insight obtained from the analysis results of case studies reveals that for nuclear power plant incident management, risk usually is not the most important concern. Cost and external attention are usually the dominant deciding factors in decision-making. However, in fact, the safety performance of each option is reflected in terms of the cost and external attention.</dc:description><dc:description>by Tze-Chieh Horng.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Engineering, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 59-60).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

(Ertugrul Mustafa), 1976-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Physics.</dc:subject><dc:description>Proteins are the functional machinery in living cells. Proteins interact with each other and bind to DNA to form so-called gene regulatory networks and in this way regulate the level, location and timing of expression of other proteins. Cells implement feedback loops to create a memory of their gene expression states. In this way, every differentiated cell in a multicellular organism remembers its expression profile throughout its life. On the other hand, biochemical reactions that take place during gene expression involve small numbers of molecules, and are therefore dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has the potential to corrupt memory storage and might result in random transitions between different gene expression states. In the first part of my thesis, I will discuss how the fluctuations in gene expression levels are regulated. The results provided the first experimental evidence that cells can regulate noise in their gene expression by tuning their genetic parameters. In the second half of my thesis, I will discuss how cells create memory by experimentally studying a gene regulatory network that implements a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback loop with nonlinear interactions creates two distinct stable gene expression states. A phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, was used to quantitatively investigate the biochemical processes in this network. The response of the network depends on its previous history (hysteresis). Despite the fluctuations in the gene expression, the memory of the gene expression state is preserved for a long time for a broad range of system parameters.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) On the other hand, for some of the parameters, noise causes random transitions of the cells between different gene expression states and results in a bimodal response. Finally, the hysteretic response of the natural system is experimentally converted to an ultrasensitive graded response as predicted by our model.</dc:description><dc:description>by Ertugrul M.

The discovery of actin based motility of the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has lead to clearer understandings of the essential ingredients required for cell motility. The biophysical mechanisms by which these proteins generate forces is the subject of intense investigation. A novel system to study force generation by this polymerization engine is introduced by combining the well characterized mechanical properties of synthetic Giant Vesicles with the well understood biochemistry of actin polymerization. Giant Vesicles mimic the structural features of eukaryotic cell membranes. We find that Giant Vesicles coated with a protein that catalyzes actin polymerization form thick actin shells which produce a compressive force. The polymerization force directed at the membrane interface causes the membrane to rupture. In the resulting collapse we find that the shell thickens inward with a constant radial velocity and is characterized by radial lines of lipid and actin. We show that actin polymerization is the primary force driving the collapse.</dc:description><dc:description>by Hyman A.

(Christopher Jon), 1975-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Urban Studies and Planning.</dc:subject><dc:description>The Community Preservation Initiative (CPI) was an innovative attempt by the Massachusetts state government to stimulate discussion about land use and growth management at the local level. Based on land use and zoning information, CPI relied on geographic information systems (GIS) to model a potential development scenario for each of the 351 municipalities in the state. The process for generating these buildout maps purposefully involved officials at local, regional, and state levels. This thesis examines the success of the CPI process in evolving land use dialog within and between communities, and amongst planners at all three levels of government. Town planners in two different metropolitan regions of Massachusetts - Boston and Springfield - were interviewed about CPI's impact on local land use discussions. This research was supplemented by interviews with other regional planners and CPI staff. The results suggest that while CPI may eventually lead to changes in local land use, in the short term few changes have occurred to the dialog on growth management in the state. The results of this investigation should aid state and regional decision-makers in determining what future policies and approaches are needed to promote smart growth and regional planning in Massachusetts and other states.</dc:description><dc:description>by Christopher J.

The crisis of sprawl has been caused in large part by poorly crafted land use regulations, many of which mandate sprawl. While an abundance of contemporary land use and planning literature focuses on the concepts of New Urbanism, little attention has been given to their regulatory implementation. And while developers and architects have responded to the problems of sprawl with plans for the development of new communities, few have looked at the opportunity to retrofit existing suburbs. This research adds to the field by illustrating how selected New Urbanist principles can be viably applied to residential infill developments in mature suburbs (specifically Greater Boston) if alternative regulations are adopted. Such development will not only preserve natural resources at the urban edge, but will ensure the efficiency and vitality of our mature core communities. Four developments in communities' representative of the Greater Boston region illustrate the contemporary (conventional) form of residential infill and two are given a post-mortem design alternative (New Urbanist). These alternative developments illustrate the viability of applying New Urbanist principles to residential infill in mature suburbs of Greater Boston. A model hamlet development regulation, used as a guide in developing the alternative designs, illustrates that:</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) 1. The application of New Urbanist principles to residential infill is a viable alternative to conventional sprawl development at the fringe of our mature communities; and 2. No drastic paradigm shift is necessary to implement the principles of New Urbanism in infill residential development. Even small changes to local land use regulations can afford significant improvements to the sustainability of our local land use regulations. The framework and results of this research are transferable to cities and towns across the Commonwealth and our nation. It is my hope that the principles and recommendations herein will be applied accordingly.</dc:description><dc:description>by Andrew Port.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.C.P.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 91-95).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

While artists' lofts are typically thought of as converted post-industrial structures, there is a need for new construction in areas where postindustrial structures are too expensive, not suitable for conversion, or nonexistent. This thesis looks at new construction of artist housing from the developer's standpoint to discover how developers can create new live/work space for artists. It explores the development of three new artists' live/work projects (The Banner Building in Seattle WA, Laconia Lofts in Boston MA, and ARTBLOCK 731 in Boston MA) to determine how and why a developer should consider building new artists' live/work space. The thesis begins with a brief review of the various forces which have led to the arts' recognition as a significant economic driver at the national, regional, and community levels. It then analyzes the space needs of artists at the individual level. These needs are contrasted with those of the developer who is faced with the challenge of developing new space for artists under regulatory and financial constraints. The three case studies inform a framework of conditions under which artists' live/work space should be considered and developed. The cases indicate the need for a certain degree of government involvement in artists' live/work development, including land use policies and building codes to enable the creation of suitable spaces, as well as subsidy to incentivize the development of affordable spaces. On the other hand, too much city oversight and regulation is seen to lead to unnecessary costs and lower project-level affordability. The built case studies illustrate how new artists' projects can revitalize neighborhoods and how professional developers are best prepared to assume the challenges of developing artists' live/work space.</dc:description><dc:description>by Krystal Ann England.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.C.P. and S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 131-136).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

However, in some applications there are independent users, and assuming that they will follow directions given by an authority is not realistic. Individuals will only accept directives if they are in their own interest or if there are incentives that encourage them to do so. Actually, it would be much easier to let users make their own decisions hoping that the outcome will be close to the authority's goals. Our main contribution is to show that, in static networks subject to congestion, users' selfish decisions drive the system close to optimality with respect to various common objectives. This connection to individual decision making proves fruitful; not only does it provide us with insights and additional understanding of network problems, but it also allows us to design approximation algorithms for computationally difficult problems. More specifically, the conflicting objectives of the users prompt the definition of a network game in which they minimize their own latencies. We show that the so-called price of anarchy is small in a quite general setting. Namely, for networks with side constraints and non-convex, non-differentiable, and even discontinuous latency functions, we show that although an arbitrary equilibrium need not be efficient, the total latency of the best equilibrium is close to that of an optimal solution. In addition, when the measure of the solution quality is the maximum latency, equilibria in networks without constraints are also near-optimal. We provide the first analysis of the problem of minimizing that objective in static networks with congestion.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) As this problem is NP-hard, computing an equilibrium represents a constant-factor approximation algorithm. In some situations, the network authority might still want to do better than in equilibrium. We propose to use a solution that minimizes the total latency, subject to constraints designed to improve the solution's fairness. For several real-world instances, we compute traffic assignments of notably smaller total latency than an equilibrium, yet of similar fairness. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results that explain the conclusions derived from the computational study.</dc:description><dc:description>by Nicolás E.

(Christopher Grey), 1979-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Operations Research Center.</dc:subject><dc:description>Stem (cell research is one of the most promising and cutting-edge fields i the miedical sciences. It is believed that this innovative research will lead to life-saving treatments in the coming years. As part of their work, stem cell researchers must first determine which of their stem cell colonies are of sufficiently high quality to be suitable for experimental studies and therapeutic treatments. Since colony texture is a major discriminating feature in determining quality. we introduce a non-invasive, semi-automated texture-based stem cell colony classification methodology to aid researchers in colony quality control. We first consider the general problem of textural image segmentation. In a new approach to this problem. we characterize image texture by the subband energies of the image's wavelet decomposition, and we employ a non-parametric support vector machine to perform the classification that yields the segmentation. We also adapt a parametric wavelet-based classifier that utilizes the Kullback-Leibler distance. We apply both methods to a set of benchmark textural images, report low segmentation error rates and comment on the applicability of and tradeoffs between the non-parametric and parametric segmentation methods.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) We then apply the two classifiers to the segmentation of stem cell colony images into regions of varying quality. This provides stem cell researchers with a rich set of descriptive graphical representations of their colonies to aid in quality control. From these graphical representatiolns, we extract colony-wise textural features to which we add colony-wise border features. Taken together, these features characterize overall colony quality. Using these features as inputs to a multiclass support vector machine, we successfully categorize full stem cell colonies into several quality categories. This methodology provides stem cell researchers with a novel, non-invasive quantitative quality control tool.</dc:description><dc:description>by Christopher G.

However, because of the fast timescales involved, there are relatively few experimental techniques capable of directly probing rearrangements of water's hydrogen bonded network. In this thesis, I investigate ultrafast intermolecular dynamics of water with time-resolved Raman and time-resolved infrared spectroscopies. These two sets of measurements provide a complimentary view of the collective and local behavior of molecular motions. Using a novel Raman technique, spatially masked optical Kerr effect spectroscopy, I first measured interaction-induced fluctuations in the isotropic many-body polarizability of water and several other liquids. In contrast to the behavior of simple liquids, the isotropic response of water is exceedingly fast and distinct from the well-known anisotropic response. I then designed and built an optical parametric amplifier that produces sub-50 fs pulses of mid-IR light to investigate the intermolecular dynamics of water through their effect on the OH oscillator of HOD in D20. By analyzing the results of three-pulse vibrational echo and polarization- selective pump-probe measurements with a comprehensive theory to describe vibrational dynamics, I extracted the timescales for vibrational relaxation, dephasing and molecular reorientations.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) At short times, vibrational dephasing reflects an underdamped 180 fs hydrogen bond oscillation, but the long time behavior indicates collective structural reorganization of the hydrogen bond network a 1.4 ps timescale. The anisotropy decays on timescales of 50 fs and 3 ps, which are attributed to librations and rotational diffusion, respectively. Lastly, I used two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to investigate the frequency dependence of the dynamics. Preliminary results reflect a distribution of timescales for both local motion and collective reorganization.</dc:description><dc:description>by Christopher J.

(Garrett Ehud), 1979-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Aeronautics and Astronautics.</dc:subject><dc:description>Design and regulatory initiatives for aircraft noise and emissions should appreciate the integrated nature of the aircraft system. The computational ability exists to consider environmental and traditional performance objectives of aircraft concurrently. This context of multi-disciplinary system design is named the Environmental Design Space (EDS) and is studied in this thesis with an integrated aircraft-engine conceptual design framework. With this tool, the objectives of this thesis were to assess the fidelity and level of uncertainty of the design framework, to characterize the tradeoffs between aircraft noise, emissions and aircraft performance and to evaluate the system-level impacts of a future noise reduction technology. Assessment of the EDS framework was accomplished with a probabilistic model assessment methodology. The assessment involved the selection of stochastic inputs and generation of output distributions through Monte Carlo simulations. A sensitivity analysis of the key drivers of uncertainty and the user-defined input distributions is also provided. This methodology was applied to one of the framework modules, the NASA Engine Performance Program (NEPP), and found that the modeling error was subsumed within the modeling uncertainty. A sensitivity study indicated that the component efficiencies had the largest impact on the output distribution. When the level of NEPFP uncertainty was propagated to the system level, the resulting coefficient of variance for fuel burn was 4.1%. The tradeoffs between the competing EDS objectives were characterized through Pareto fronts generated by multi-objective genetic algorithms.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The quantification of these trades for a given aircraft, 8 dB in cumulative EPNL vs. 8kg of LTO-NO[sub]x for example, give designers and regulators supporting information for their decisions. A future noise reduction technology, fan trailing edge blowing, was also evaluated at the system level. A probabilistic analysis of the technology design in the EDS framework revealed poor tolerance of engine cycle variability. A robust design procedure was employed, and showed that while the technology offered a flyover noise reduction of 11.9 dB, it incurred a fuel burn and LTO-NO[sub]x penalty of 2.8% and 11.0%, respectively.</dc:description><dc:description>by Garrett E.

Mission failure causes publicity that the industry cannot afford in this economy. To maintain project schedules and prevent budget overruns, problems in the spacecraft system design must be found early in the development stages. An approach to using existing system design visualizations to aid system verification and validation in the early design stages is described. These commonly used system design visualizations are used to create and intent specification in a systems engineering development environment known as SpecTRM. The intent specification is executable and analyzable, allowing system design flaws and requirements problems to be determined prior to any hardware or coding development. An example of the utilization of these system design visualizations to create an intent specification is applied to the mobility and positioning system (MAPS) of a robot designed to process thermal tiles on the space shuttle.</dc:description><dc:description>by Stephanie Sharo Chiesi.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 55-56).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

Assuming a rigid, perfectly-plastic solid subject to a static load distribution, the problem of limit analysis consists of finding the minimum multiple of this load distribution that will cause the body to collapse. This collapse multiplier results from solving an infinite dimensional saddle point problem, where the internal work rate is maximized over an admissible set of stresses -defined by a yield condition- and minimized over the linear space of kinematically admissible velocities for which the external work rate equals the unity. When strong duality is applied to this saddle point problem, the well-known convex (and equivalent) static and kinematic principles of limit analysis arise. In this thesis, an efficient procedure to compute strict upper and lower bounds for the exact collapse multiplier is presented, with a formulation that explicitly considers the exact convex yield condition. The approach consists of two main steps. First, the continuous problem, under the form of the static principle, is discretized twice (one per bound) by means of different combinations of finite element spaces for the stresses and velocities. For each discretization, the interpolation spaces are chosen so that the attainment of an upper or a lower bound is guaranteed. The second step consists of solving the resulting discrete nonlinear optimization problems. Towards this end, they are reformulated into the canonical form of Second-order Cone Programs, which allows for the use of primal-dual interior point methods that optimally exploit the convexity and duality properties of the limit analysis</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) model and guarantee global convergence to the optimal solutions. To exploit the fact that collapse mechanisms are typically highly localized, a novel method for adaptive meshing is introduced based on local bound gap measures and not on heuristic estimates. The method decomposes the total bound gap as the sum of positive elemental contributions from each element in the mesh, and refines only those elements which are responsible for the majority of the numerical error. Finally, stand-alone computational certificates that allow the bounds to be verified independently, without recourse to the original computer program, are also provided. This removes the uncertainty about the reliability of the results, which frequently undermines the utility of computational simulations. The efficiency of the methodology proposed is illustrated with several applications in plane stress and plane strain, demonstrating that it can be used in complex, realistic problems as a supplement to other models.</dc:description><dc:description>by Héctor Ciria Suárez.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 109-111).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

The problem of controlling an unmanned aircraft via natural language inputs is formulated as a feedback control problem, and notions of state, controllability, and observability are defined under this model. An implementation of such a system is also described. The phraseology of the existing air traffic control language is used as a base command set; to form this command set, a corpus of air traffic control commands was gathered from recorded exchanges between pilots and controllers at Boston's Logan Airport, as well as Laurence G. Hanscom Field in Bedford, MA, and these were used as the "target language" for this implementation. Knowledge of air traffic control and airport operations, combined with existing natural language processing techniques, is used to achieve a higher recognition success rate than a traditional natural language processor designed for a more general domain of discourse would. This :is the first known attempt at formalizing air traffic control phraseology for use in an unmanned system.</dc:description><dc:description>by Emily M.

The line smoothing algorithm is presented for unstructured meshes, and p-multigrid is outlined for the nonlinear Euler equations of gas dynamics. Analysis of 2-D advection shows the improved performance of line implicit versus block implicit relaxation. Through a mesh refinement study, the accuracy of the discretization is determined to be the optimal O(h[superscript]P+l) for smooth problems in 2-D and 3-D. The multigrid convergence rate is found to be independent of the interpolation order but weakly dependent on the grid size. Timing studies for each problem indicate that higher order is advantageous over grid refinement when high accuracy is required.

However, due to its high computational cost, CFD is limited for some applications. Therefore, model reduction has been used to derive low-order models that replicate CFD behavior over a restricted range of inputs, and various frameworks have been developed. Unfortunately, the majority of those methods are limited to linear cases and do not properly handle reduction of nonlinear systems. In order to overcome restrictions of weak nonlinearity and the costly representation of the system's nonlinearity found in other nonlinear reduction approaches, a trajectory piecewise-linear (TPWL) scheme is developed for a CFD model of the two-dimensional Euler equations. The approach uses a weighted combination of linearized models to represent the nonlinear CFD system. Using a set of training trajectories obtained via a simulation of the nonlinear CFD model, algorithms are presented for linearization point selection and weighting of the models. Using the same training trajectories to provide a snapshot ensemble, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to create a reduced-space basis, onto which the TPWL model is projected. This projection yields an efficient reduced-order model of the nonlinear system, which does not require the evaluation of any full-order system residuals, while capturing a large portion of the nonlinear space. The method is applied to the case of flow through an actively controlled supersonic diffuser. Convergence of the TPWL approach is presented for both full-order and reduced-order cases.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) The TPWL approach and the POD combine naturally to form an efficient reduction procedure and the methodology is found to yield accurate results, including cases with significant shock motion. Reduced-order PWL models are shown to be three orders of magnitude more efficient than the nonlinear CFD for simulation of a representative test case.</dc:description><dc:description>by David Gratton.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 75-79).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

This thesis outlines a three-step procedure for model tuning of complex opto-mechanical systems in the presence of measured experimental data. It is the hypothesis of this thesis that this procedure will produce a model that effectively tracks along configuration changes. The first step, engineering insight, applies model heuristics to the simulation model in an effort to produce a simulation model that includes all physical effects in the experiment. The next step, model updating, is an automated procedure whereby an optimization problem is formed in order to set uncertain model parameters. The final step is model tracking across configurations. Configuration changes include, but are not limited to, changes in mass, input/output locations, changes in geometric properties and relative placements. A new metric is provided which helps to gauge the level of experimental/model mismatch in the new configuration (using the updated model) by using the objective function from the optimization in Step 2. Using this metric, one can determine how the model changes with respect to specific configuration changes. Finally, this three-step tuning procedure is compared against traditional model tuning on a testbed at the MIT Space Systems Lab (SSL) in order to gauge its usefulness. The traditional model tuning will be performed by a colleague in the SSL who will use such methods as trial-and-error parameter updating to match the simulation model to the experimental data.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.)

Motivation for this development is based on current diffuser and heat-exchange technologies in cogeneration plants, which require a large geometric footprint to generate steam using gas-turbine exhaust. A compact design is hypothesized to replace these technologies using synergistic design concepts. An investigation into the feasibility of such design concepts are conducted, providing pressure-recovery, viscous losses and thermal energy extraction sensitivities to cooling and annular blade geometry variations. Results show promising diffusion and heat-transfer capabilities that match or surpass current design performance. Proposed configurations are outlined based on these results that compare favorably to a baseline industrial cogeneration application.</dc:description><dc:description>by David S.

(Stephen Charles), 1978-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Aeronautics and Astronautics.</dc:subject><dc:description>An atmospheric entry and descent full-state navigation filter is developed and presented. Using this filter a navigation performance analysis is performed to examine the effects of various instrument packages and differing sensor scenarios for the entry and descent phase of the Mars Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Survey (ARES) mission. Deterministic simulation in conjunction with Monte Carlo techniques is used to verify navigation performance of an extended Kalman filter. This analysis specifically compares the performance of four feasible instrument packages. examines navigation performance as it varies with changes to initial sensor activation altitude, and examines error sources and covariance trends for this entry and descent scenario. The results from the analysis show that large attitude uncertainty resulting from the LN200 IMU bias causes a breakdown of the filter algorithm dlue to nonlinearities. The addition of a surface relative velocity measurement, to the altimeter measurement provides only marginal position uncertainty improvement and significant velocity and attitude uncertainty improvement. Increasing the initial altitude for sensor activation provides slight improvements in position uncertainty. but large velocity and attitude uncertainty improvements. Finally, it is shown that initial state uncertainty dominates over all other error sources in this navigation analysis. Error growth within the principal states (position, velocity, and attitude) is predominantly a product of the near-constant attitude uncertainty as it transfers from the innocuous roll attitude channel into the more consequential pitch and yaw attitude channels.</dc:description><dc:description>by Stephen C.

A lateral guidance logic was developed for tightly tracking a desired flight path. The guidance logic is derived from geometric and kinematic properties, and has been demonstrated to work better than the conventional aircraft guidance method in waypoint navigation. A simple, low-order attitude estimation was developed that combines aircraft kinematics, GPS and low-quality rate gyros. It is demonstrated in simulation that the performance of the proposed method is as good as other advanced complex methods when the aircraft bank angle is relative small(&lt;40 degrees). The end-game control strategy for the final phase of the rendezvous was also developed, using proportional navigation guidance in conjunction with an optical sensor. The associated miss distance was analyzed with regard to the wind effect and initial conditions. A series of flight tests was performed using two UAVs which were built as a part of the project. It was demonstrated that each individual aircraft can follow a desired flight path within a position accuracy of 2 meters (based on sensor data) while also tracking the air speed command to within 1 m/s. At the time of this thesis writing, it has been demonstrated that the developed control system can bring the two UAVs from any arbitrary initial positions into a configuration of a tight formation flight, where one vehicle trails the other with a commanded separation of 12 meters while maintaining the relative position error within 2 meters in both horizontal and vertical directions for 85% of the flight time.</dc:description><dc:description>by Sanghyuk Park.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

Several fast quantum algorithms are known, but the nature of quantum speedup is not well understood, and inventing new quantum algorithms seems to be difficult. In this thesis, we explore two approaches to designing quantum algorithms based on continuous-time Hamiltonian dynamics. In quantum computation by adiabatic evolution, the computer is prepared in the known ground state of a simple Hamiltonian, which is slowly modified so that its ground state encodes the solution to a problem. We argue that this approach should be inherently robust against low-temperature thermal noise and certain control errors, and we support this claim using simulations. We then show that any adiabatic algorithm can be implemented in a different way, using only a sequence of measurements of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate how this approach can achieve quadratic speedup for the unstructured search problem. We also demonstrate two examples of quantum speedup by quantum walk, a quantum mechanical analog of random walk. First, we consider the problem of searching a region of space for a marked item. Whereas a classical algorithm for this problem requires time proportional to the number of items regardless of the geometry, we show that a simple quantum walk algorithm can find the marked item quadratically faster for a lattice of dimension greater than four, and almost quadratically faster for a four-dimensional lattice. We also show that by endowing the walk with spin degrees of freedom, the critical dimension can be lowered to two. Second, we construct an oracular problem that a quantum walk can solve exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) This constitutes the only known example of exponential quantum speedup not based on the quantum Fourier transform. Finally, we consider bipartite Hamiltonians as a model of quantum channels and study their ability to process information given perfect local control. We show that any interaction can simulate any other at a nonzero rate, and that tensor product Hamiltonians can simulate each other reversibly. We also calculate the optimal asymptotic rate at which certain Hamiltonians can generate entanglement.</dc:description><dc:description>by Andrew MacGregor Childs.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

An understanding of the physics of charge transport in QDs is not only important for realizing QD based electronic devices, but it also provides crucial insight into the chemical and optical properties of QDs. This thesis highlights how photoconductivity measurements are valuable to advancing our understanding of QD physics because they are exquisitely sensitive to the optical, chemical, and electronic properties of QDs. The work presented in this thesis emphasizes how the chemistry and physics of QD films are deeply entwined. Chapter 2 demonstrates that the photoconductivity and dark conductivity of CdSe QD films are enhanced following annealing at high temperatures. Chapter 3 illustrates that the purity of the QD capping reagent (tri-n-octylphosphine) and the methods used for film preparation can each affect the observed photocurrent by two to three orders of magnitude. In Chapter 4, the methods for CdSe film preparation developed in Chapter 3 are used to make films that exhibit photoconductivity properties consistent with having a low density of trapped charges, in contrast to previous studies. Chapter 5 also uses chemistry to bring CdSe QD films into a new regime of photoconductivity physics. Post-deposition chemical treatments that increase photocurrent by up to three to four orders of magnitude are presented. The voltage dependence of the photocurrent after treatment is consistent with having achieved unity exciton separation efficiency. Furthermore, by bringing CdSe QD films into this</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) new regime of higher photoconductivity physics it is found that energetics prevent the facile injection of charges from gold electrodes into CdSe QDs, but there is no barrier to charge extraction.</dc:description><dc:description>by Mirna Jarosz.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (Ph.

In the first part of the work, we deal with the problem of simultaneously routing data along multiple disjoint paths from a source to destination in the most energy efficient manner. To this end, we developed and analyzed both optimal and heuristic algorithms that find minimum energy node and link disjoint paths in a wireless ad hoc network. Our major results include a novel polynomial time algorithm that optimally solves the minimum energy 2 link-disjoint paths problem, as well as a polynomial time algorithm for the minimum energy k node-disjoint paths problem. Additionally, we demonstrate via simulation that when disjoint path routing is employed, network lifetime is significantly extended when our routing algorithms (in combination with a simple heuristic) are used. In the second part of the work, we deal with a slightly different reliability problem. In particular, we consider the problem of how to best ensure that QoS sessions (e.g. those with a minimum capacity requirement) do not get dropped after their primary path has failed. Our methodology is to attempt to eliminate one potential cause of session drops, i.e. the inability for the interrupted session to find a backup path with sufficient capacity. To this end, we developed a spare capacity allocation scheme whereby we a-priori reserve backup capacity in the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme via simulation, and we show that in certain scenarios of reasonably high network load and node mobility, the probability of session drop can be substantially lowered through minimal backup capacity allocation.</dc:description><dc:description>by Anand Srinivas.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics; and, (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 79-83).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

Considerable transformation in the higher education arena has begun to take place in step with the shift of industries from manufacturing to knowledge-based. The competitive environment has altered and paved the way for new entrants to successfully emerge and offer more educational options to students. This research will discuss the factors that may influence the wave of higher education learning in the near future. Various technological research and initiatives led by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, NASA and other organizations highly contribute to the technological advancements in distance learning and other interactive learning modes. Faculty will play an important role in the progress of non-traditional learning approaches as they continue to experiment and work on the available technologies. Established institutions in higher education maintain many traditions and invest a lot of resources to continuously improve their current processes. New entrants cater the needs of a different type of market composed of working adults and students who seek to learn specific skills and improve their employability. They employ a different type of business model that might prove to be disruptive. The new institutions have begun to invade the market of established institutions that have difficulty switching to new technologies and teaching methods due to the rigidities experienced in their organizations.</dc:description><dc:description>by Veronica Go.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.M.O.T.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, Management of Technology Program, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 85-89).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

They represent the basic, defining transactions that represent an asset in the market. Almost all financial concepts, such as returns or risk, are essentially abstractions from tick data. Like atoms, ticks form a truly massive dataset - millions per day, far too numerous to represent with traditional graphical methods. Information-intensive disciplines such as medicine, bioinformatics, the earth sciences, and computational fluid dynamics have adopted modern visualization methods to manage and explore their respective mountains of data. Finance, however, has done little with the discipline of visualization to date. This research presents the hypothesis that information visualization of tick data can improve human performance for intraday equity trading. To consider the hypothesis, the act of equity trading is broken into functional tasks, and the tasks mapped to information requirements. Using the TAQ historical dataset, the research evaluates new 2D and 3D information designs for tick data, and creates a visual language for equity trading. The functional tasks and information designs are implemented in a visualization application, which provides an almost purely graphical trading interface to historical ticks. The user experience, trading performance, and analytical insight from this application are evaluated versus numeric methods. Based upon this experiment, the research concludes by exploring the usability, potential issues and future directions of trading and tick visualization in general.</dc:description><dc:description>by Pasha Roberts.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, February 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 80-82).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

Already, UAVs have demonstrated commercial marketability in such diverse areas as scientific and environmental research, cross-seas shipping, communications relays, emergency management, border monitoring, agriculture, and aerial photography. Small-scale tactical UAVs in particular have an enormous potential to fulfill a number of roles within urban centers, transforming the way civil safety institutions carry out their jobs. A lack of established flight regulations is currently the greatest barrier to the standardized use of these vehicles. While the United States is currently the world's leader in UAV manufacturing, this position is tenuous given strong competitive threats from a variety of foreign countries who are already ahead in establishing a standardized regulatory environment for UAVs. As part of a larger research effort focused on the design, implementation, and demonstration of highly maneuverable rotorcraft UAVs, the primary objective of this work is to examine how UAVs might gain access to and function safely in civil and commercial markets. Despite the wide variety of existing UAVs in terms of size, targeted flight altitude, and capability, this work focuses primarily on small-scale tactical vehicles with the intended purpose of operating in and around urban centers. Operational requirements and risk mitigation strategies can be devised and effectively implemented to allow such UAVs to be operated at an acceptable level of risk. By combining GIS data manipulation with modem approaches to path-planning, UAVs can be operated such that the risk to the general public and urban infrastructure is</dc:description><dc:description>minimized. Instead of focusing on vehicle reliability requirements which severely limit present-day experimentation and development of UAVs, efforts which focus on operational strategies allow for applications of the technology to be explored while the systems continue to grow more reliable. Public-private coalitions should expand their efforts beyond high altitude, long endurance UAVs to establish operating regulations for all of the vehicle classifications. The diversity of UAVs should be treated with an equally diverse set of regulations tuned to the particular requirements and risk management issues each classification represents. Finally, local and national government should recognize civil UAVs not only as a new commercial industry of great potential, but also as a latent threat to domestic security for which regulations should be established sooner rather than later.</dc:description><dc:description>by Kara Lynn Sprague.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, Technology and Policy Program, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (leaves 50-52).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

S., 1974-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Technology and Policy Program.</dc:subject><dc:description>As radio technologies and public policies evolve, an increasing amount of spectrum is being set aside for transmission use without a license. These license-exempt, or "unlicensed" bands, include 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz in the USA and much of Europe. I argue that this unlicensed spectrum, and low-cost wireless technologies that operate in these bands, is of particular value in the developing world, where it has the potential to substantially impact accessibility and availability of information and telecommunication services. In the context of numerous institutional and structural obstacles to entry license-exempt regulation potentially provides a friendly environment for entrepreneurship, reducing barriers to entry and the risk of regulatory capture. In order to assess this opportunity in the context of Africa, I have surveyed every country in the continent on their regulations and use of the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. Responses, from differing country informants though mostly from the regulators themselves, were received from 47 of the 54 countries of Africa, which accounts for 95% of the continent's population. The responses show that there is significant diversity and heterogeneity in the regulation of these bands across Africa. Not only do licensing requirements and specific conditions change widely from country to country, but so do power, range and services restrictions, as well as certification requirements. In addition, regulation is still not in place in some countries, and is changing in others. Enforcement is low, adding to overall uncertainty. Lack of clarity in regulation and enforcement creates confusion and may discourage smaller players from entering the market. For bigger players interested in taking advantage of economies of scale</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) and implementing common strategies across borders, the heterogeneous regulatory environment will also act as a deterrent and a barrier to entry. Despite this heterogeneity, these bands are being used in most African countries, not only for "hotspot" style or other localized coverage in urban areas, but also for longer area coverage. A significant 37% of the countries that responded are using wireless technologies operating in these bands for providing backhaul network connectivity in rural areas. In unlicensed bands regulation tends to place a burden on the transmitter though, e.g. through power restrictions, in particular where competition in the market is low. In view of the continent's weak teledensity and lack of alternative infrastructure, establishing a more certain and uniform regulatory framework and promoting an appropriate business climate across Africa may be instrumental in encouraging private investment and connectivity through technology in these bands. The TU may have a key role to play, both by issuing clearer guidelines for the regulation of license-exempt bands, and by serving as a convening forum for countries to establish common regulatory strategies. While a fair balance is needed in regulation, this thesis argues that governments should err on the side of laxity in order to lower barriers to entry and counterbalance current overregulation of these bands.</dc:description><dc:description>by Maria Isabel A.S.

Michael (John Michael), 1978-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering.</dc:subject><dc:description>The goal of a design engineering organization is to design products that satisfy customers. Reaching this objective is dependent, among other things, on five parameters: the customer expectations, the target percentage of satisfied customers, the nominal performance of the design, the variability in the manufacturing processes, and the sensitivity of the design performance to such variability. This work presents a unified methodology that is amendable to computer implementation for modeling these five parameters for products that are primarily mechanical in nature. The validity of this methodology is subject to five major assumptions: the nominal performance of the design matches the performance expected by the customer, the set of customer expectations can be represented completely by a set of geometric relationships and tolerances between features in the assembly, the degradation in product performance is due solely to quantifiable variability or mean shift in the assembly geometry, the variability in each geometric relationship is independent of the variability in any other geometric relationship, and any compliant parts in the assembly can be accurately modeled as sets of rigid parts connected with linearly-compliant joints. The assembly model is developed using a combination of Screw Theory, Network Theory, Homogeneous Transformation Matrices, and Probability Theory. It is shown how this model can be used to verify the manufacturability of a mechanical assembly design. It is also shown how the model and the results obtained from it can be used to improve the level of manufacturability of a design if it is found to be unacceptably low. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the methodology, an automated version written for Matlab®</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) was used to model and analyze the manufacturability of an engine valvetrain. The results of this case study are presented and compared to results using existing industry-standard tools. Several suggestions for improving the manufacturability of the valvetrain are also proposed and discussed.</dc:description><dc:description>by J.

(Thomas Alan), 1979-</dc:creator><dc:subject>Mechanical Engineering.</dc:subject><dc:description>A detailed model was developed for an ionic electro-active polymer (EAP) actuator. The electrical and chemical domains of the system were modeled using a simple electrical circuit. Ionic charge storage within the polymer was described using a linear reticulated model. This model improves upon the continuum diffusive model introduced in prior work by providing a low order model of diffusion that can be analyzed in the context of modern and classical control methods. Additionally, the reticulated diffusion model describes the dynamics of ionic charge distribution within the polymer, which enables a more precise calculation of electromechanical coupling. An interesting observation of ionic electro-active polymers is that they exhibit enormous asymmetry in coupling from electrical to mechanical domains. While electrical potentials produce large linear displacements (5% strain or greater), uniaxially-applied mechanical loads result in a negligible electrical back effect. This is surprising, suggesting that there are huge entropic losses when applying mechanical loads. After examining the mechanics of the system it was theorized that the apparent lack of coupling is actually the result of the Poisson Effect, which causes changes in the volume of an object when uniaxial loads are applied. A derivation of the stored electrical energy and strain energy led directly to a set of constitutive equations that are able to account for the asymmetric coupling observed in EAP. The solution to the uniaxial loading boundary condition was developed fully and compared to prior work. Experimental results from an EAP actuator composed of polypyrrole, a widely-used conducting polymer, validate the electro-mechanical coupling model. MATLAB was used to simulate the</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) response of the actuator and the results compared to the experimental data. Results verify that the model accurately describes the electrical, mechanical, and coupled behavior of the system. The correlation between the model and experimental data is very good for electrically-induced strains up to 3% and applied potentials up to 1 Volt above the potential of zero charge (PZC); these are within the typical operating range of polypyrrole. The model is sufficiently simple to allow real-time control while also exceeding prior models in its ability to predict polymer behavior in normal operating ranges.</dc:description><dc:description>by Thomas A.

Various control policies are implemented in simulations of manufacturing systems to test whether they increase the efficiencies of the systems in terms of specific performance measures of interest. Among the control policies, Control Point Policy (CPP) is deeply studied, because this policy is designed for controlling complex manufacturing system with multiple product types. First, fundamental research in CPP is presented to understand the effects of the parameters on single product type manufacturing systems. Then, multiple product type, assembly-disassembly systems are studied with various control policies, including hybrid policies. Finally, a real automobile manufacturing system case study is presented, and various control policies are experimented on in the simulation model. Because the evaluations of performances are done by simulations, the speed of simulation becomes a very important problem. This thesis therefore presents a new approach to accelerating the speed of simulation.</dc:description><dc:description>by Chiwon Kim.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (S.M.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2004.</dc:description><dc:description>Includes bibliographical references (p. 109-110).</dc:description><dc:description>This electronic version was submitted by the student author.

While the process is currently employed in applications such as these, a lack of knowledge of the basic mechanics of the process has made developing robust processes and preventing process failures extremely challenging. The current work addresses this problem through the development and validation of mechanics-based models that connect the wafer geometry, etch pattern, clamping configuration, and work of adhesion to bonding failure. An energy-based bonding criterion, which allows the effect of flatness variations and etch patterns to be quantified, is presented and employed to develop analytical and numerical models. Analytical models, based on plate theory, are developed to examine the role of wafer-scale shape variations, etch patterns, and the clamping configuration. Finite element models are developed to verify the analytical models and to evaluate the bonding criterion for wafers with anisotropic elastic properties and arbitrary geometries. Experiments in which silicon substrates with wafer-scale shape variations and etch patterns were bonded demonstrate that the shape and size of the bonded area and the shape of the bonded pair can be predicted using the models developed. The effect of mid-spatial wavelength height variations (nanotopography) on bonding is examined through a combination of modeling and experiments. The experiments and analysis provide a route for characterizing nanotopography and assessing its impact on bonding. The accuracy of the wafer bonded double cantilever beam, which</dc:description><dc:description>(cont.) is one method to evaluate the key process parameter of interface toughness, is also examined in the current work. The results of the modeling and experiments are discussed to provide guidance in process, device, and tool design. The models that are presented may be used to establish tolerances on wafer geometry and to improve process control.</dc:description><dc:description>by Kevin T.

Longer frames improve interleaver performance by separating adjacent symbols further in time and thus require less E[sub]b/N[sub]t, in burst noise conditions, to maintain a target FER at a given data rate. The overall benefit is to improve throughput capacity for today's high bandwidth cellular services. This thesis analyzes the average power usage and data throughput with longer frames for various channel models and radio configurations. Through experimental and simulative testing in a laboratory setting, MFI is shown to use less power per unit of throughput at the link layer in slow fading, single path channel environments. However, gains over 20ms frames diminish for faster fading and multipath, and the limitation of the forward link scheduler in accurately predicting channel conditions handicaps any gains at the link level.</dc:description><dc:description>by Jia Fu Cen.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.

It is hypothesized that a person acquires a bias to favor the characteristics of their native language, in order to aid word learning. Other hypothesized aids are syntactic bootstrapping, in which the learner assumes that the meaning of a novel word is similar to that of other words used in a similar syntax, and its complement, semantic bootstrapping, in which the learner assumes that the syntax of a novel word is similar to that of other words used in similar situations. How these components work together is key to understanding word learning. Using cognitive psychology and computer science as a platform, this thesis attempts to tackle these questions using the classic example of manner and path verb bias. A series of cognitive psychology experiments was designed to gather information on this bias. Considerable flexibility of the subject's bias was demonstrated during these experiments. Another separate series of experiments was conducted using different syntactic frames for the novel verbs to address the question of bootstrapping. The resulting information was used to design a Bayesian model which successfully predicts the human behavior in the psychological experiments that were conducted. Dynamic parameters were required to account for subjects revising their expected manner and path verb distributions during the course of an experiment. Bayesian model parameters that were optimized for rich syntactic frame data performed equally well in predicting poor syntactic frame data.</dc:description><dc:description>by Catherine Andrea Havasi.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.

A software application, ccrec, was written to make the device easy to use by displaying real-time waveforms and storing the recorded signals in files for later analysis. The results of some preliminary tests of the device's ability to make accurate recordings, including the performance of the software and a test of the frequency response of the stethoscope sensors, are presented.

It can be divided into shorter units of motion with respect to time. Secondly, a movement can also be decomposed into a base motion and a motion texture. We define the term, basic movement, to reflect properties from both of these decompositions of movement; it adheres to the atomic length property in time and also describes the baseline graph of a motion. We additionally define the terms, alphabet, as the complete set of all distinct basic movements in a motion database, and grammar rules as the set of all frequently occurring sequences of the basic movements. Determining the alphabet and the grammar of a motion capture database assists in addressing the organizational issues plaguing the process of motion capture, as well as provides a notational representation of motion. In this thesis, we introduce a method for determining the alphabet and grammar of rhythmic motion.</dc:description><dc:description>by Jonathan H. Chu.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.

Unfortunately, it also promises to make programmers' jobs harder since they cannot know what components are available in the run-time environment and as such, cannot statically plan out their programs. To help this situation, we propose goal-oriented programming, which may be more amenable to programming pervasive applications. Goal-oriented programming adds a level of indirection between Goals, high-level intentions such as "make me available for chat," and Techniques, the code that implements the intentions. Each Technique is a combination of code and prerequisite subgoals, so that a Technique can be itself goal-oriented. By decomposing an application this way, it is possible to automatically build parts of it based on the runtime environment. When an application would like a Goal satisfied, the implementation Planner first finds Techniques that can satisfy the Goal, and then recurses to satisfy the Techniques' subgoals. After a sufficient number of Techniques are found, the Planner evaluates the Techniques in some user-defined way, and chooses a set to execute. This work focuses on programming framework that isolates the planning aspect of goal-oriented programming from the Goals and Techniques themselves. We provide a reference Planner and evaluate its how well the Planner performs in simulation.</dc:description><dc:description>by Justin Mazzola Paluska.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.

This thesis presents a novel fully integrated operational amplifier design that addresses both measurement limitations by using a fully differential mechanical transductor input stage, fabricated using SOI-MEMS technology. The input stage of the amplifier is a MEMS structure that provides a variable capacitance to transduce a low-frequency input voltage into a high-frequency AC current. This up-modulation of the input signal is exploited to reduce offsets and low-frequency noise, and the dielectric isolation of the MEMS structure provides high input impedance and low leakage currents. To function, the MEMS-based amplifier includes two co-dependent feedback loops. The 'drive loop' utilizes closed-loop control to vibrate the MEMS structure at its mechanical resonant frequency to produce a modulating capacitance. The 'sense loop' senses the up-modulated signal from the MEMS structure, and provides gain and demodulation to this signal. Global feedback around the sense loop allows for accurate measurement of the input voltage.</dc:description><dc:description>by Song-Hee Cindy Paik.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.

The thesis is split into two parts, representing two facets of how engineers will evaluate the LT6600: by simulation and in the laboratory. The LT6600-10 macromodel and its design methodology is presented, as well as comparisons of macromodel characteristics with measured characteristics of the LT6600-10 IC. For the lab demonstration portion, the LT6600-2.5 was integrated into a digital code-division multiple access (CDMA) communications system, complete with transmit and receive sections. The performance of the LT6600 in this system was shown to be as good as or better than most conventional filtering approaches. When implemented in a communications system., the LT6600-10 required up to 13 less components than other reasonable filtering options and provided 4th-order signal attenuation with only 14 nV/[square root]Hz of voltage noise spectral density.</dc:description><dc:description>by Cheng-Wei Pei.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.

Specifically, we study a prototype system of spinning discs. The system combines linear dynamics describing rotation with a nonlinear observation model determined by the disc pattern, which is parameterized by angle. A consequence of the nonlinear observation model is that the posterior state distribution of angle and spin-rate is multi-modal. This detail motivates the use of particle filtering. Practical issues that we consider when using particle filters are sample depletion and sample degeneracy, both of which lead to poor representations of the state distributions. Variance based resampling and regularization are common methods to mitigate sampling issues in particle filtering. We investigate these methods empirically for our prototype problem. Specific parameters of interest relating to these methods are the number of particles used to approximate the posterior distribution, quantitative methods for deciding when to resample, choice of regularization variance, the impact of measurement noise on all of these, and performance over time. A common issue, leading to inaccurate sample-based representations, is the case of relatively low measurement noise combined with an insufficient number of particles. Our empirical results show that for relatively smooth patterns (e.g. linear, cosine) particle filters were less susceptible to sampling issues than for patterns with higher frequency content. The goal of our experiments is to quantify the nature of these differences.</dc:description><dc:description>by Aurora Clare Schmidt.</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis (M.
