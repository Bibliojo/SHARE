<dc:description>In the year 2006 over 500 new energy drink brands were put on the market and over 7 million adolescents reported consuming energy drinks (Meadows-Oliver &#38; Ryan-Krause 2007). Estimates of consumer spending on energy drinks in 2008 exceeded $744 million dollars (International Food Information Council). Consumers often perceive energy drinks as healthy without knowledge of the amounts of ingredients in these beverages. Caffeine and sugar are the prominent ingredients found in many energy drinks but other substances such as riboflavin, pyridoxine, nicotinamide,taurine, and various herbal derivatives are also present (Aranda &#38; Morlock, 2006). Due to the growing popularity of energy drinks, we investigated the ingredients found in popular energy drinks sold in the Treasure Valley. Our methodology included on-site data collection at grocery and convenience stores during October and November 2008. Ingredient data was also obtained from manufacturers’ websites. Our research breaks down the ingredients, calories, and vitamins found in energy drinks, therefore helping consumers make an educated decision before consuming these popular beverages.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Steinfelt, Saandra</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose is to document the Special Olympics and its interactions with rural Idaho; the town of Horseshoe Bend. I will highlight the torch and runners coming down Highway 55 and the gathering in the high school gym afterward. I will show clips of the Special Olympians in competition on the slopes of Bogus Basin Ski Resort, and their interactions with the spectators. I will also highlight the awards ceremony. This film will act as a means to show the general public how the Special Olympians touch our hearts.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Energy drinks have continued to gain popularity since the introduction of Red Bull in 1997 (Boyle, M., Castillo, VD. 2006). In one self-report survey, 51% of college students reported consuming more than one energy drink per month (Malinauskas, B., Aeby, V., Overton, R., Carpenter-Aeby, T., Barber-Heidal, K. 2007). College students use energy drinks for many reasons including as a study aid, to enhance athletic performance, and as a mental stimulant (Bichler 2006; Froiland, Koszewski, Hingst, Kopecky 2004). The growing trend of energy drink consumption by college students prompted the research question: Where are energy drinks sold on the Boise State campus? Five Boise State University Health Science Students were responsible for collecting the surveillance data. Every building on campus was accounted for and a map was created to visually see where energy drinks could be purchased. The results were surprising in the fact that not many buildings had vending machines that sold energy drinks. This study prompted additional questions for future research such as: policies for sale of energy drinks on campus; volume of energy drink sales by location; and changes in energy drink sales over time.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As the global population continues to grow, more and more people are moving into urban areas. This rise in urban density is leading to rising crime rates in many of the world’s metropolitan areas, although research shows that there is a high degree of cross-city variance of crime rates across U.S. urban areas. The Boise City-Nampa area has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States given the high quality of life and business opportunities that the Treasure Valley has to offer. Even with substantial population growth, the Boise area has seen a decline in crime rates over the past ten years. Our group will be examining the infrastructure and resources that Boise has utilized over the past ten years, compared to cities of similar size that have not had as positive an experience to determine the factors that have led to the decline in Boise’s crime rate. We will also be analyzing future needs and demands of the Boise area that could be crucial in maintaining Boise’s low crime profile.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Energy Drink Consumption by Boise State University Students: An Exploratory Study to Determine Reasons and Patterns of Intake</dc:title>

<dc:description>Energy drinks are defined as beverages which typically contain caffeine, taurine and vitamin(s) and may contain an energy source (e.g. carbohydrate) and/or other substance(s), marketed for the specific purpose of providing real or perceived enhanced physiological and/or performance effects (Finnegan). The consumption of these drinks to stimulate and arouse the mind is increasing among individuals in the 18-25 year age group. More than 200 new energy drinks were introduced between July 2006 and August 2007, with many of them endorsed or formulated specifically for certain populations, including athletes. Hooters and NASCAR are two examples of the partnerships that have been created to boost energy drink sales (Zegler 2007). Published studies have reported that a significant number of college students consume energy drinks. Some of the more common reasons for consuming energy drinks in this age group include: to stay awake when studying, working or driving; to mix with alcohol; as a refreshing beverage; and for athletic performance (Malinauskas et al 2007 &#38; Fierra 2006). This study was undertaken to compare reasons for intake of energy drinks by Boise State University students to published studies. In addition, this study explored the relationships between intake of energy drinks, gender, age, credit load taken, and activities, such as exercise, work, studying or consumption of alcohol to determine if there were significant consumption patterns.
This study was approved by the Boise State Human Subjects Research and Institutional Review Board #193-09-023.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Learning Outcomes and Electronic Textbooks</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Morrison, Amanda</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The increased availability of distance learning and of electronic media in the classroom has increased the presence of electronic textbooks (e-texts) on the market. These textbooks are often offered at a reduced rate to the student and offer additional functionality, including advanced search features, practice problems and on-line tutorials. The additional functionality provided by many e-texts may allow e-text users to spend less time in achieving similar learning outcomes than their hard-bound textbook-using cohort. In answering this hypothesis, we hope to address the following questions: Do students make use of the additional e-text options, above and beyond what students with a hard-copy text would? Does the availability of an e-text increase the time that students spend studying course material and preparing for exams? If not, are students able to achieve the outcomes while spending less time preparing? Does the use of an e-text improve student recognition and comprehension of the key theories and tools in microeconomics? Does the use of an e-text improve the students’ ability to apply and synthesize microeconomic theory and to apply it to problems not directly addressed in the class? Does prior experience with e-texts aid the potential improvement in learning outcomes?</dc:description>

<dc:description>This senior design project is the evaluation and design of a replacement for a culvert on Five Mile Creek, near Lowman in central Idaho, which has been identified as a barrier to safe passage of endangered fish. Near the confluence of Five Mile Creek and the South Fork of the Payette River, the 72” diameter culvert has been identified as a barrier to fish passage, specifically for bull trout and red branded trout, by the Federal Fish Passage Coordination Group (FFPCG). The culvert has an excessive gradient which creates a velocity too large for fish to swim against. Design includes consideration of a bridge or larger culvert, costs, environmental impact analysis, structural and geotechnical design parameters, traffic control planning and hydraulic analysis of the creek. Structural and geotechnical considerations include a bridge design to span the creek, meeting the Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (ASHTO) loading requirements, and foundation design that does not exceed soil bearing capacity. Plans will also be provided for rehabilitating the creek bed below the new passage structure to simulate natural conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This senior design project is for the design of the Prairie Sun Subdivision, located in rural Elmore County, Idaho, to the northeast of Mountain Home near the intersection of Ditto Creek Road and Squaw Creek Road. The project site covers an area of 181 acres and consists of nearly 80 residential lots ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 acres. The twenty-six acres of common area includes a two-story clubhouse with full amenities as well as an area for social gatherings, a pool and an exercise room. The subdivision is accessible by a network of on-street and off-street bicycle pathways and horse trails that border the subdivision boundary, meander through the common lots, and provide access to adjacent Bureau of Land Management lands. Since public water and sewer utilities do not exist in close proximity to the subdivision, the design includes a public well, an emergency water storage tank for fire protection and domestic supply, and individual, lot-specific septic systems. Prairie Sun Subdivision provides a picturesque setting of hills and open spaces while the long, curving, landscaped parkway sets a pleasant and memorable tone for the residents and guests entering and leaving the community.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Mendoza, Martha</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Critical literacy is a pedagogical tool to empower and encourage students from oppressed backgrounds into believing in their own power and voice. Using guidelines outlined by critical literacy standards and scholarly research, the purpose of this study was to evaluate an assortment of children’s books in Spanish in order to create a critical literacy curriculum resource for bilingual educators. By providing this select reading material, educators can encourage dialogue and analysis of issues of social injustice and oppression. Further considerations for this study will consist on case studies and action research, where the selected critical literacy curriculum resource is used in classroom settings.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>International Students’ Awareness and Use of Counseling Services</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Nina, Anile</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Although differences between domestic and international students’ sources of academic stress, awareness and use of counseling services have been studied extensively, less attention has been devoted to the impact of unawareness and under utilization of counseling services on international students’ academic stress. In addition, little is known about the relation between academic stress and psychological adaptation in international students. Data was collected from 62 international students at a large public university in the Rocky Mountain region. Academic stress was measured by stressful life events. Psychological adaptation measured tension, depression, anger, vigor, confusion, and fatigue. Use of counseling services measured awareness, use, and willingness to see a counselor. As predicted, results showed a significant difference in academic stress between international students who are aware of counseling services and those who are not aware. In addition, international students who reported higher levels of academic stress also reported poorer psychological adaptation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Long Term Water Quality in a Commercial Office Building</dc:title>

<dc:description>Reuse of urban wastewater has been recognized as a means to potentially alleviate water shortage problems. Despite the high potential for the reclamation of urban wastewater, few countries have implemented processes to utilize this resource. The Banner Bank Building in downtown Boise, Idaho is an eleven-story commercial office building which has been awarded platinum status by the U.S. Green Building Council under its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System. A key reason for this recognition is the innovative implementation of an on-site water reuse system, which treats storm water and grey water for reuse in lavatories in lieu of potable drinking water. This water reuse system has aided in reducing the building’s consumption of treated potable water by 60% to 80% compared to office buildings of similar size and use. We have been granted access to the reuse system, its plans and schematics, system design, and points-of-use for the purpose of sampling and analyzing water quality within the reuse system. The goal was to evaluate water quality of the reuse system in comparison to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) primary and secondary drinking water standards. For example, turbidity met primary drinking standards in 88.6% of the samples analyzed. Here, we discuss the results of our nine month sampling and recommend possible system upgrades to provide further utility of urban wastewater reuse.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Examining the Present Day Use of Traditional Native American Medicine in Tribes of the Northwest</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wilson, Hailey</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background: A study done in Brazil investigated the local traditional medicines and found that many were being used in conventional medicines. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) some of the primary concerns regarding traditional Native medicines, including Native American medicines, are retaining the knowledge for future use and the sustainability of the plant resources that are chiefly grown in the wild. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to better understand the uses of traditional medicine in Native American communities, the barriers faced with traditional medicine use, and the issues regarding the preservation of these medicines. Methods: Community-identified Native American traditional medicine users will be interviewed and findings compared.
Conclusion: It will be found how the the practice of traditional use of medicines are passed on to the next generation in the Northwest, as well as challenges faced by those that use traditional medicines. Methods to improve the retention and sustainability of these practices is also expected</dc:description>

			<dc:title>A Statewide Assessment: The Prevalence of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Problems Among Detained Juveniles in Idaho</dc:title>
<dc:creator>VanNess, Emily</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Research in the past several decades has revealed the startling prevalence of mental health and substance abuse problems among individuals in incarcerated populations. In this study, we examined the prevalence rates of mental health and substance abuse problems among detained juveniles. We also assessed gender differences and rates of comorbidity. Data were collected by clinicians from 11 juvenile detention centers throughout Idaho during 2008. Clinicians administered the Alaska Screening Tool (AST) to 2,060 detained juveniles to determine if they met the diagnostic criteria for a mental health and/ or substance abuse problem. More than 68% met the diagnostic criteria for a mental health problem. Girls (at over 76%) were statistically significantly more likely to meet the AST criteria for a mental health problem than were boys (65%). Nearly 55% of all juveniles met the diagnostic criteria for having a substance abuse problem. Comorbid mental health and substance abuse problems were documented in 41% of the juveniles. These findings suggest that mental health and substance abuse problems are highly prevalent among juveniles detained in Idaho; in fact, having at least one of these problems seems to be the norm. This knowledge adds to the current body of research and supports the need for juvenile justice systems to intervene and aid in treatment of mental health and substance abuse problems to prevent future recidivism and related social costs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>2008 Archaeological Excavations at Three Island Crossing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Walker, Juli</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Bentley, Dianna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Three Island Crossing (190EL0294) is located along the Snake River near Glenns Ferry, Idaho. It is situated near the Three Island Crossing on the Oregon Trail. Boise State University conducted excavations at the site in 1986 and 1987. These excavations documented three Late Archaic occupations dating during the past 1500 years. Evidence of multiple occupations/uses of the site is documented by the recovery of more than 1400 prehistoric artifacts, and the excavation of a structure and storage pits. The site produced the largest assemblage of fish remains (salmon) from any Snake River site. In 2008 the site was revisited in an effort to assess the extent to which the site area extended to the east along the Snake River. Analysis of the material culture remains indicate that the area studied in 2008 is likely on the periphery of the greater site area.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Intimate Partner Violence Among Latino Pregnant Teens and their Partners: Testing a Prevention Program</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Varela, Alberto</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Throughout the literature, intimate partner violence (IPV) is defined as physical violence, threats of physical or sexual violence, psychological and emotional violence, and sexual violence; and in some cases stalking is included as part of the definition (Center for Disease Control, 2006). The purpose of the current study was to examine intimate partner violence among adolescent pregnant teens and their partners. Specifically, this study examined physical and non-physical violence, jealousy, and positive conflict resolution. The intention was to test a preventive intervention among adolescent relationships. We were interested in examining the intervention effect on the Latino adolescent couples. Forty-one Latino couples were recruited through public health clinics and high schools. Couples were randomly selected to intervention or control groups; twenty-four couples participated in the intervention and seventeen couples participated in the control. Female partners ranged in age from fourteen to eighteen. Male partners ranged in age from fourteen to twenty four. Participants took part in multiple interviews. Audio information was collected and used from the interviews. Couples were independently interviewed at Time 1 (pre-intervention, before the baby was born) and Time 2 (8-12 weeks post-birth). An original scoring template was created to measure Intimate Partner Violence within the relationship. We expected a decrease in violence over time, both physical and non-physical, among couples who participated in the intervention and couples who were not part of the intervention. Additionally, we expected that higher rates of jealousy at Time 1 would predict higher rates of IPV at Time 2. Results indicated that couples who participated in the intervention had significantly less IPV than couples who did not. Results also indicated that jealousy was significantly related to IPV; however, this outcome was not expected. This study shows that the preventive intervention being tested may have an effect on the participants who were involved.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Technology in the Classroom: The Future is NOW!</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Gaskell, Cory</dc:creator>
<dc:description>With the 21st century upon us, technology is at the forefront of almost every aspect of the way we live. Today’s technology means the future is now for classroom teachers! More and more schools are becoming equipped with the latest in teaching technologies. My goal is to research the kinds of technologies teachers are using in their own classrooms on a day to day basis. I want to learn what kind of technology has been the best teaching tool for them and how they learned how to use it. I also want to look at any negative aspects of classroom technology the teachers have experienced. Lastly, my research is going to measure any need or interest in further educational technology education for today’s teacher.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Northside Boulevard Interchange serves the western Treasure Valley by providing interstate access to downtown Nampa, various agricultural and industrial zones, and a growing volume of commuter traffic. Interstate 84 is undergoing lane expansion projects to facilitate future traffic demands throughout the greater Treasure Valley. The expansion of the interstate corridor necessitates the following improvements to the Northside Boulevard Interchange: 1) the redesign and rebuilding of existing interstate overpass bridges to accommodate the interstate expansion, 2) the realignment and addition of lanes to existing on-ramps and off-ramps, 3) the addition of one lane to Northside Boulevard, for a total of six lanes, and 4) the redesign of existing intersections of Northside Boulevard and the interstate on-ramps and off-ramps. To meet the required levels of service D for design year 2030, capacity analyses were performed for all components of the interchange. A system was designed to collect and store stormwater resulting from these interchange improvements. The new bridges and appurtenant foundation and subsurface design were designed to adequately service the interchange and interchange components through 2030.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Basque DNA: An Investigation and Comparison of 17 Y-Chromosome Microsatellite Loci of the Local Basque Population - Euskal Herriko Eta Euskal</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zubizarreta, Josu</dc:creator>
<dc:description>DNA was processed from cotton oral swab samples, taken from volunteers of the Boise area Basque population. In order to determine genealogy and mode of Basque ancestry, questionnaires were collected along with the swabs. In total, thirty samples reported a paternal Basque lineage and were used in the investigation. Seventeen microsatellite loci of Y-chromosome DNA were analyzed and the allele frequency data was compared to published data on individuals living in the Spanish part of the Basque Country. Similar to a twin study, the purpose of this comparison is to measure the genetic connection between the immigrated Basque population and that of the source Basque population. By using techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR, and the 310 Genetic Analyzer capillary electrophoresis, the specific alleles at each microsatellite loci were tabulated. The genetic diversity was compared within and between immigrant and source populations. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed using the ARLEQUIN Version 3.1 program.

<dc:description>Rapid population growth in the Boise area tends to stretch the existing capacity of our roadways – especially, certain corridors - during rush hour. The section of highway on I-84 between Broadway and Caldwell sees increased amounts of traffic during peak driving hours. Our research will identify the causes of congestion and the subsequent impact of using HOV lanes during peak hours. Included in the analysis will be considerations such as the number of passengers required to access the HOV lane, times of operation of the HOV lane, and whether it would be beneficial to also use it as a toll lane. Data will be collected from previously published ACHD and Idaho Transportation Department reports and studies as well as other federal transportation agencies. We will also present data from comparable cities that have implemented HOV lanes. The expected outcome of this research is to show that HOV lanes could decrease travel time between the aforementioned Broadway and Caldwell exits during peak hours. A predicted decrease in negative externalities such as pollution, automobile accidents, and noise is also expected.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Interchanges from Five Mile Road in Boise to the Karcher Interchange in Nampa are being redesigned to help meet the area’s growing population and reduce congestion on the interstate. This senior design project is for the redesign of the I-84 Interchange at Meridian Road. Meridian Road will be expanded to six lanes and the Interstate will be expanded to eight lanes. A Single-Point Urban Interchange (SPUI) was determined to be the most feasible option available that will be able to handle the current and future levels of traffic through the year 2050. The project will include turning lanes, bike lanes across the overpass, and breakdown lanes on the highway designed to meet existing and future traffic needs. Our project also included analysis of geotechnical engineering reports, an environmental assessment, evaluation of existing and future traffic volumes, management of storm water drainage for the site and a preliminary cost analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The city of Boise is rapidly growing and we believe that Boise can better accommodate this growth by utilizing mixed-use zoning. Our research will focus on the mixed-use community of Bown Crossing. Using this development as a template, we will conduct an analysis of the economic costs and benefits for the local residents and businesses. Due to the rising popularity of smart growth developments, we will examine the successes and failures of mixeduse developments in Boise. We will compare and contrast low density developments with high density mixed-use developments by focusing on factors such as traffic congestion, commute times, transportation and parking costs, tax revenue through increased or decreased consumer spending, as well as agglomeration effects. We expect to show that the benefits of mixed-use zoning out-weigh the associated implementation costs.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Koyukon Issues of Conservation and Sustainability in the 21st Century: Struggling to Preserve Cultural Heritages</dc:title>

<dc:description>This research examines the impact of statehood, on the traditional subsistence patterns and practices of the Koyukon, a northern Athapaskan people of interior Alaska. We used existing ethnography, as well as a recent visit by one of our members, to provide insight into the Koyukon’s complex belief system and their seasonal hunting, fishing, and game selection practices. We looked at the effects of designation of wildlife refuges and national parks encompassing large tracts of historic Koyukon hunting and fishing territories. The Koyukon have a broad perspective on the entire social-ecological system, including history and political landscape. For the Koyukon, subsistence is related to the larger political, spiritual, epistemological settings of their lives and their culture. We make a comparison of our ethnographically enriched political ecological model of Koyukon resource use and settlement with Lewis Binford’s (1980) Forager-Colllector model. Koyukon political economy incorporates traditional strategies in a modern context and local attempts to preserve their cultural heritage. The Koyukon, provide a unique opportunity to study a group with a rich and expansive knowledge of their history, culture and traditional patterns of subsistence. These topics are not merely academic interests, but vital to their daily lives.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Enhancing PCR Amplification From Diluted DNA Samples Using Experimental Formulas from Biomatrica</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Siebert, Abby</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Very dilute DNA samples present problem for forensic analysts. These samples often degrade, and their low concentration makes DNA amplification difficult or impossible. Recently a new compound was produced (PCRboost, Biomatrica) based on molecules found in water bears (tardigrades, see image). These tiny remarkable animals can live up to 120 years without water, survive temperatures from close to absolute zero to 151°C (303°F), and recover after being exposed to the vacuum of outer space. Dr. Hampikian’s laboratory at Boise State University is working with Biomatrica to assess new formulations of their product aimed at enhancing forensic DNA analysis. In this study, I show the results of DNA tests done on my own diluted DNA with several experimental formulations from Biomatrica. DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN), from cheek swabs and then amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Using quantitative realtime PCR the amount of quantifiable human DNA was accurately determined. The quantified DNA was then diluted down to 1.0 picogram/microliter. The diluted DNA was then used to test amplification effectiveness using ABgene standard Taq polymerase with and without the experimental products (Biomatrica) added to the reaction mixture. The amount of DNA amplified with and without each of three experimental products was compared by first measuring the amount of PCR product, and then evaluating the quality of sequencing reactions for each experimental compound.</dc:description>

<dc:description>First impressions of women are formulated from observable characteristics that convey messages about their personality characteristics and demeanor. Hair, clothing, posture, smile and eye contact are a few examples of the factors that influence these perceptions. Impression management is important not only because judgments are made in a quick and permanent manner, but they may also affect the future of a relationship before it has even started. The purpose of this study was to determine the specific factors that influence the first impressions of women, as well as the messages each of these factors convey. To collect data during the research of this topic, students at Boise State University over the age of 18 were asked to either complete an online survey or participate in a personal interview. Both methods led respondents to list or discuss elements that influence the formulation of opinions about women in five different categories: intelligence, confidence, sociability or friendliness, trustworthiness or honest and physical attractiveness. The study was limited by respondent fear of judgment and a topic scope that was larger than anticipated; however, the results of this study revealed that (a) as a whole, first impressions are influenced by nonverbal communication and body language more than clothing, hairstyles and accessories, and (b) first impressions can not be scientifically determined due the highly subjective nature of the elements of social desirability.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The spread of western civilization and industrial societies in the last century have lead to the disruption of many cultural systems of tribal peoples who only recently have been contacted. Such outside influence has lead to the alteration and/ or destruction of many environments across the globe. One society which has managed to resist outside influences are the Dani, a people living in the central highlands of Papua New Guinea. These intriguing peoples have developed and maintained, through religious beliefs, subsistence strategies , and political and economic systems, a relationship with their environment which has lead to optimization of tropical rainforest resource use with no seasonality and low levels of diversity. Their resistance to outside influences by Christian missionaries beginning in the 1960’s has allowed the Dani to maintain their traditional life ways and as a result their environment and ecosystems have remained relatively unchanged.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this research was to understand the agricultural innovations of Hmong farmers in Northern Thailand, and how these innovations were brought about as a result of national development programs and international movements regarding opium eradication and environmental conservation. The history of the Hmong, along with their humanenvironmental interactions, have shaped their perceptions about conservation and facilitated an intense involvement in conservation efforts. The methodology used was a survey of the relevant ethnographic work and other published materials on the history of the Hmong, their economic interactions as well as their traditional agriculture known as swidden cultivation. We looked at some of the specific conservation efforts in which they have been involved, within Northern Thailand, and concluded that local people do in fact play an important role in global conservation movements while still maintaining their cultural identity.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Calibration and Field Sample Collection Using an Ion Mobility Spectrometer for Detection and Analysis of Subsurface Volatile Organic Compounds</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zumwalt, Ashley</dc:creator>
<dc:description>An ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) is capable of detecting gaseous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a chemically composite environment. An IMS system measures the drift time of ions traveling against a counter-flowing neutral drift gas within an electric field and at ambient pressure. IMS has been successfully implemented in airports and government projects for real-time detection of drugs, explosives, and chemical warfare agents. The focus of our research isto apply ion mobility spectrometry to identifying and quantifying harmful VOCs that contaminate subsurface soils. An IMS probe system designed for real-time, subsurface soil-gas sampling applications is presented. The system is encased in a 51-mm outside diameter stainless steel probe housing which includes a compact IMS sensor (at the heart of the probe), a sampling module, a signal amplifier, and high voltage system to sustain IMS performance. A heated gas chromatog raphy (GC) column has been added to the IMS system for additional separation of compounds during the extraction of complex samples. To ensure accurate VOC detection and quantification, calibration curves were created for the BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene) of known concentrations in the laboratory. These curves were used to quantify results from IMS sample spectra collected from a BTEX contaminated site. The results indicate that the IMS can be successfully used for the identification and quantification of BTEX under field conditions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Geometry in First Grade: Building a Research-Based Unit</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, Charlotte</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My research project was to design a research based unit for a first grade class, teach it, and compare the pretests with the posttests. When I started designing the unit, I chose to focus on the geometric figures performance standards from the Meridian School District standard-based report card for first grade.
The standards are:
• Recognize and name 2D and 3D shapes (triangle, rectangle, square, circle, cone, cube, cylinder)
• Compare and describe attributes of 2D and 3D shapes (e.g. angles, number of faces, 2D, 3D)
• Sort and classify 2D and 3D shapes by more than one attribute, then describe the attribute used (“How are they the same? How are they different?”)
• Build and draw 2D and 3D shapes (triangle, rectangle, square, circle, cone, cube, cylinder)
This unit focused on the four 2D figures specified. I designed an introductory lesson, a lesson focused on each shape and a concluding lesson. In my lessons, I planned on having the students do all the things mentioned in the standards. My pretest and posttest were designed to assess the standards. The research suggests that “Children exhibit various types of misconceptions, such as undergeneralization, which can occur because they include irrelevant characteristics; overgeneralization, which can occur because some key properties are omitted; and language-related misconceptions” (Fuys and Liebov, 1997, p. 248). All of these misconceptions are related; essentially students do not fully understand a concept and the vocabulary that goes with it. One important idea I found is that it is important to use multiple examples and non-examples of concepts in many contexts. I tried to do this throughout the unit. My main objective was for the students to be able to identify, build, draw, and describe our four basic shapes. To do this, we talked about the attributes of each shape, often informally, and how they compared to other shapes. We then used the attributes we had found to identify, build and draw them. Research has also found that students go through different levels of understanding of shapes. Most of the students in the first grade class were likely at the visual level—they identify shapes according to their appearance (Clements and Sarama, 2000, p. 482). I was trying to push them to a more descriptive level—they recognize and can characterize shapes by their properties (Ibid.). I found that the majority of the students in the class increased their scores from the pretest to the posttest. They clearly had a better understanding of geometric shapes and were able to analyze shapes for similarities and differences.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Stream Computing Research and Practical Cartesian Meshing for Complex Urban Environments</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Caylor, Matthew</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The motivation for our research is to accelerate the simulation of contaminant dispersion in urban environments. Computational turn-around time for every stage of the simulation task needs to be fast because of emergency response requirements. To address this issue, we’ve shortened the preprocessing stage of the simulations by developing a practical semi-automated approach to extract the building domains from Geographical Information Systems databases. Additionally, we investigate the stream computing paradigm to accelerate numerical computations of partial differential equations on the modern graphics hardware. In particular, we assess the computational performance of the Brook+ programming language on AMD’s FireStream boards with 320 streaming cores relative to a conventional processor. Brook+ is a high level language that handles all the memory copying and allocation on both the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU).</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Climate Variability and Water Infrastructure: Historical Experience in the Western United States</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Marley, Craig</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Greater historical perspective will enlighten current debate about future human responses to higher temperatures and increased precipitation variation. Agriculture is particularly vulnerable. In the literature on climate change and agriculture the empirical results are often mixed, with estimates of nonlinearities in key commodity yields beyond threshold temperatures; findings of higher profitability for US agriculture; and reports of high adjustment costs. These studies generally rely upon contemporary data. Yet, the expansion of agriculture across North America in the 19th and 20th centuries encountered greater climatic variation than is predicted from current climate change models. Accordingly, analysis of how those conditions were addressed and the impact on crop mixes and production can provide valuable information for addressing current climate variability. This study adds to the literature on adaption to climate shocks.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this research project is to find how television influences student achievement, specifically overall grades. I will be notating how long students watch television and the types of shows they prefer to watch. This study will include a television log and an interview of a child. The television log will be done at home. Each day, the students will be expected to record what television shows they watch and for how long. This log will take one week to complete. After logs have been turned in, I will be interviewing students about their television rules and habits. I will then analyze the data collected and compare it to each child’s overall grade in the classroom. This will allow me to see if there is a correlation between television (how much and the types of shows being watched) and achievement.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Private Property Versus Collective Property in Rural Hungary: A Test Case for the Anthropology of Sustainability</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Fetzer, Paige</dc:creator>
<dc:description>My research investigated land privatization in postsocialist Hungary and the effect of this property regime change on resource use and land production efficiency in rural communities. I developed models that illustrate the changes in land distribution as a function of the change in government policies on property and food distribution/markets. I reviewed literature and case studies focused on the transitional use of resources for the area, specifically during the privatization of land. The research addressed the question of whether privatization of land affected resource use by 1) degenerating the land or 2) by reducing the productive efficiency of the area as predicted by Garrett Hardin’s “Tragedy of the Commons” and Marginal Value Theorem, respectively.</dc:description>

A communication standpoint provides a necessary social filter that illuminates how to navigate through and negotiate these difficult relationships. The addict socially represents himself or herself in specific and knowable ways; more importantly, their behavior serves as a social barometer by which they are recognized as addicts. In this paper, however, my focus is not on the addict but rather on those affected by the behaviors of addicts. I created a user guide for “Normies” (a colloquial term used among AA members as an individual who does not suffer from addiction). My intention is to offer the Normie reader a greater tolerance for her or his situation with the addict. It does not necessarily provide solutions, but rather is a starting point for a plethora of communicative directions Normies may choose from. Interviews, communication research, and personal experience resulted in this user guide for non-addictive individuals seeking to better their communication with the addicts in their lives.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It is a commonly held belief of many Idahoans that the cost of living in Boise is much lower than in other metropolitan areas in the country. Our purpose is to test this hypothesis and evaluate its accuracy. In addition to the analysis of the cost of living in Boise compared to other metropolitan areas, we will reconcile the differences in the costs of living with quality of life measures to ascertain the effect of local area amenities. We will compare Boise to several cities across the United States based on the ACCRA cost of living index which measures differences in expenditures on grocery items, housing, utilities, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous goods and services. We will also use additional data obtained from the most recent U.S. census, U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics and American Statistical Association, among other sources. With a simple econometric model, we will show that cost of living is correlated with quality of life indicators. We also expect to find that the cost of living in Boise is lower than larger cities, but may not be lower than cities of a similar size.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Antibiotic Resistance and the Pentapeptides: Novel Antibacterial Agents For Methicillin Resistant &#60;em&#62;Staphylococcus Aureus&#60;/em&#62;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wolter, Matt</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) are strains of Staphylococcus Aureus that are resistant to a large family of antibiotics called beta-lactams that include penicillins (e.g. oxacillin) and the cephalosporins. A 2007 report estimated that between 1995-2005 MRSA related hospitalizations more than doubled from 128,000 to 278,000. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of novel anti-Staphylococcal pentapeptides at inhibiting the growth of both S. Aureus and MRSA through a standard growth assay, IC50 study, and Kirby-bauer testing. The results of this experiment demonstrated that certain pentapeptides showed antibacterial activity and increased the effectiveness of oxacillin for MRSA.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Testing Thermal Properties of Clothing</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mermerian, Aledia</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Information about the thermal properties of clothing is needed to estimate the potential health and safety risks associated with living and working in hot or cold environments. Assessment of these factors has always been difficult and expensive. However, a new system has been developed at BSU that now permits measurement of these parameters accurately and inexpensively. The overall goal of the project was to evaluate the performance of the new system. The investigation consisted of two parts: 1) system calibration, and 2) determining the thermal properties of selected garment combinations. To calibrate the system, the inflatable mannequin was placed in a temperature controlled room where heat input was varied from 0 to 300 watts in 50 watt increments. The input and output air temperatures of the inflatable thermal mannequin were monitored using digital temperature sensors. Several clothing combinations were tested including a “semi-nude” configuration which served as the ”control” for all experiments. The mannequin wore long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and a jacket. Whole-body sweating was assessed for both static (standing) and dynamic (running) conditions. System calibration measurements showed a linear relationship for both input and output air over the 300 watt input range. Heat insulation characteristics for the combination of pants, shirt, and jacket showed incremental and proportional increases in body insulation. The measurements of cooling through sweat evaporation showed heat loss exceeding the combined insulation capacity of the clothing. The tests demonstrated that the thermal mannequin system can be used effectively to determine whole body insulation for various clothing systems. The results also suggest that the impact of clothing insulation on whole body heat exchange must be determined for both static and dynamic conditions.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Nursing Students and Technology: Is Virtual Simulation Feasible?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Stevens, Craig</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Purpose: Simulation learning scenarios are increasingly utilized in nursing education as a way for students to gain experience taking care of patients. Virtual reality is a developing technology where students can participate in nursing simulation scenarios. Student accessibility to virtual reality technology is a potential barrier for implementing this teaching-learning tool. This project will assess the technology needed for virtual reality nursing simulations and the technology available to students enrolled in nursing classes at Boise State University.
Background: There are several virtual reality platforms currently available for instructor-student use, however, Second Life is currently the largest and most well developed. Simulation scenarios can be developed for a traditional lab setting and modified to be used in Second Life. The learning objectives, scenario flow, and debriefing questions remain the same; it is the environment that students participate in that is different.
Description: Based on Second Life technology requirements, a survey was developed to measure students’ technology resources, their experience with Second Life, their computer comfort level, and some basic demographical information. Third semester nursing students will be asked to complete an anonymous paper copy of this survey. All other students will be able to complete an anonymous online survey from the department website. Third semester students were selected to complete a paper survey because they will be invited to participate in a Second Life nursing simulation pilot project in the fourth semester.
Importance: Virtual reality simulation scenarios allow for the creation of learning opportunities for students that are not possible in a lab setting. In addition, virtual reality simulations are not limited to students and faculty located in close geographic proximity to each other. In order to utilize virtual reality simulations, faculty must be aware of students’ access to technology and their experience with this type of environment. The results of this survey will allow faculty to better understand how the availability of technology will affect the potential use of a virtual reality simulation related to nursing education.

<dc:description>Using the student population at Boise State University, surveys were conducted to gatherinformation on the positive aspects of video games among male and female students. Using surveys, students could fill out online through the use of Qualtrics, as well as having participants filling out paper surveys; we had a total of 82 complete responses (56 men and 26 women). Participants were asked about their age (average: 25.59 men and 23.27 years women), how long the respondents had been playing video games (both males and females have over 10 years), and how many hours each participant played video games during a day (average: men 1.68 hours per day and women played for 1.26 hours.) Special attention was paid to game selection and the gratifications and rewards associated with playing video games. The results indicate that the top two gratifications/rewards that men and women gain from playing video games is for the arousal (men 4.23 and women 3.77) and social interaction (men 3.75 and women 3.96). The result for game selection shows that the top three games genres selected by men are shooter, action/adventure and sports games. The top three game genres for women were puzzle, racing/speed games and arcade games. Additionally, the games were coded for aggressiveness, as well as ranked the categories based on the types of games that existed within the category and their potential for aggressiveness. The aggressiveness of the top three games, based off of our code (#1- most aggressive through 10-least aggressive), for males was shooter (#1), action/adventure (#3) and sports games (#6). For the women puzzle (#10), racing/speed games (#7) and arcade games (#8). After analyzing the content of our results, our basic assumptions about men and women in reference to game selection and the correlation of violence/ aggression in the games compared to the sex of the player was supported by our research.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Bullet Lead Analysis: Unreliable and Potentially Misleading</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Studnar, Sally</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis (CBLA) is a forensic technique that utilizes analytical chemistry to identify amounts of trace elements such as copper, arsenic, antimony, and tin within bullets. These tests are performed to link crime scene bullets to other bullets possessed by suspects. The analysis is based on the theory that every batch of lead has a unique elemental makeup. These assays are typically employed when the firearm involved in a crime has not been recovered or when the physical markings of a fired bullet are too mutilated for comparison. This technique was introduced after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and has since been used in approximately 2500 cases by the FBI. However, in 2002, the FBI asked the National Research Council (NRC) to evaluate the scientific basis of comparative bullet lead analysis1. The NRC concluded that variations in the manufacturing process of ammunition rendered the science “…variations among and within lead bullet manufacturers make any modeling of the general manufacturing process unreliable and potentially misleading in CABL comparisons.”2 This study examines: the scientific history of CBLA as well its history in the courts. These findings are being used to examine several Idaho criminal cases where CBLA played a key role.

			<dc:title>Impact of Air Quality Regulations on Entrepreneurial Activity</dc:title>
<dc:creator>James, Kyler</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The objective of this research is to examine the impact of Federal National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) non-attainment status on the entrepreneurial activity in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Most of the existing research on the relationship between non-attainment and the financial robustness of areas focuses on the big polluters (e.g., plastics, organic chemicals, steel smelting and refining, etc.), and examines how many of the big polluters failed or relocated, measured by the change in the number of plants/firms when an area moved from attainment to non-attainment. Our paper will use a 317 MSA panel data set over the 1989-2003 timeframe, to address the question more comprehensively by looking at all industries, not just a targeted few polluters. Controlling for other time-variant confounding effects, such as population growth, per-capita income, tax rate changes, minimum wage rates, energy costs, regional inflation measures, and spatial phenomena (such as, natural disasters) we isolate the effect of non-attainment status on large polluters as well as the linkage industries. We show that if an area is designated non-attainment status in a particular year, it leads to a decline in the total number of business starts in the MSA in the following year. We also determine whether the impact of non-attainment varies across businesses of different sizes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This is a senior design project for the Eagle interchange located along I-84 in Meridian, Idaho. Currently, it is one of the most heavily used interchanges in the state with average daily traffic volume of 17,000 vehicles. The traffic flow along this interchange is expected to grow to 25,000 vehicles per day by 2030. To satisfy this increase in volume, an innovative diverging diamond interchange has been selected to meet Idaho Transportation Department design standards for safety and minimal delay. Our project consists of components from each of the following areas of Civil Engineering: geotechnical (foundation design), environmental (permitting and storm water drainage), transportation (road design to meet Level-of-Service D and safe passage of bicyclists and pedestrians), and structural (bridge renovation). Upon completion, the design of Eagle Road will be capable of accommodating 2030 traffic volumes at an appropriate level of service.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Bio-politics of Drugs in U.S. Political Discourse</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kopp, Jennifer</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This paper has two goals. First this paper examines the historical and theoretical relationship between bio-power and drugs as a modern form of political power. Secondly, it describes how people in modern society are subjected to bio-political mechanisms in terms of public health. Three dominant types of drug discourses result from the analysis: crime, health, and commerce. As the modern bio-politics has taken hold and increased in its reach, the frequency of drug discourses in Presidential speeches has also increased. The data set includes 220 speeches from 1790 to 2007 collected from “The American Presidency Project.” They were indexed using a text retrieval program called Word Cruncher 6.0. Results conclude that drugs and crime discourse is the most prevalent followed by health and commodity. The modern era of drug use in 1968 split presented these discourses before and after. The use of bio politics as a mechanism is displayed through its connection of different discourses mentioned earlier in a table which I have completed and displays the year of the first presidential speech to the present. Different examples from the actual state of the union addresses are utilized to reflect the analysis. To also highlight the conclusion section of this analysis, it seems to be that the regulation of drug policies, concerning crime as well as utilizing the health sector, bio-power seems to be a force in the care, management, regulation and maintenance of the nation state’s population.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Descriptive Comparative Secondary Analysis of the Somali Bantu Population in Africa vs. Boise</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Grote, Vanessa</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Background: In the early eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Bantu were brought as slaves from Tanzania and Mozambique to Somalia. In 1991, a civil war in Somalia displaced the Bantu to Kenyan refugee camps. In 1999, the Bantu people were considered “persecuted” due to the dangers and mistreatments of the camps as well as the violence that they faced in their homeland. They are now in the process of migration to the US, and into Boise. There are an estimated 40,000 Somali refugees within the US, and Boise is home to approximately 261 individuals.
Purpose: The purpose of this descriptive secondary analysis is to provide insight to this population that currently resides in Boise, ID. This review will support evidence of the lives and culture of the Somali Bantu in Africa compared to their transitions into life in Boise, ID.  Methodology: The descriptive analysis will be completed through a literature review, and a comparative secondary analysis of the data that the Boise State Research team has regarding this population here in Boise.  Implications: This comparative analysis will illuminate the similarities and differences of the Somali Bantu, and will promote a greater understanding of the transitions and adaptations they have had to make to their own culture, and how that may effect this population. The information will be disseminated in hopes of promoting more effective care of the Somali Bantu people.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Relationship Building with Students at the Elementary and Intermediate Levels</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Tuft, Holly</dc:creator>
<dc:description>By doing this study I am interested in finding out how teachers build positive, successful relationships with their students at the elementary and junior high levels and the similarities and differences between how relationships are built at those levels. I would also like to find out what effects positive, successful relationships have on the students. I plan on finding out this information by observing teachers at both levels in their classrooms interacting with their students and interviewing the teachers I observe. I also plan to do this by distributing a survey to the teachers on how they build relationships with their students. To find out how these relationships affect students I will read several professional journals. I will then collect the data, organize and analyze it and report my final findings at the undergraduate fair.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Legitimizing Torture: How Similar Ideologies of the United States in the War on Terror and the French in Algeria Led to Torture</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lawatch, Brian</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The United States’ effort to win the war on terrorism by spreading democracy served to legitimize torture by circumventing international and domestic laws, creating ambiguity and confusion among members of the United States military. France too, in the French-Algerian War of 1954-1962 used torture in the name of spreading the benefits of French civilization. This study discusses the role of ideology by comparing similarities between France and the United States in terms of each nation’s world views. Ideology is discussed in the creation of laws legitimizing torture and how government officials came to decisions that allowed for abuses to happen. Winning these wars was considered so important that both the French and U.S. governments either created or interpreted laws in a way that allowed for torture. Government investigations are examined, revealing the role of ideology in the reports and how that effected recommendations for punishment for those culpable in torture acts. French bias is revealed, showing a strong desire to promote the torture activities, believing the methods to be effective. U.S. reports reveal a desire to fix the problem but do not investigate the roots of the abuse, for fear of losing the moral ideological authority of carrying out its wars. Ideology affected the judgment of individual soldiers in both conflicts. Confusion among the soldiers and their sense of duty to their nation affected the decision to engage in torture, sometimes believing it to be government policy to abuse prisoners in order to stop future attacks. Lastly, public perception of torture has affected how these wars are remembered. Thus, the experience of France in the Algerian War of 1954-1962 and its use of torture should have been a warning to the United States of how a well-meaning ideology can deny people the values those ideologies are said to promote.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Power system protection is concerned with protecting electrical power systems from faults within the network by isolating the faulted components so as to leave as much of the remaining the electrical network operational as possible. Moreover, by properly protecting the system components from overloading, the probability of fires and other catastrophic and expensive system failures can be minimized. In understanding power protection, it is necessary to understand what is actually being protected. Providing superior protection is essential in mitigating the effects of disruptions on system stability. As such, it is essential for power engineers to understand the concepts and practices underlying power protection. The creation of a Power System Protection Lab at Boise State University gives students the opportunity to gain some real world experience in protection. Moreover, a lab of this type facilitates educational opportunities. It also provides numerous additional benefits such as research and industry cooperation. The overall objective of this project is to determine the design requirements and parameters for a Power System Protection lab at Boise State University. Some design considerations for the lab include cyber protection, power quality, and future interchangeability studies. Moreover, in the interest of efficiency and cost effectiveness, we avoided acquiring redundant or unnecessary equipment. We have provided a list of the equipment to establish the power protection lab along with sources and overall cost. The lab model includes the lab’soverall structure, testing software and equipment, and research capabilities.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Turbulent Political History of the Democratic Republic of Congo</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Muzaliwa, Johali</dc:creator>
<dc:description>On June 30th, 1960 the Congo erupted in joy as it gained its independence from Belgium. The cruel and unimaginable horrors of King Leopold’s regime were over. The unjust and patronizing rule of Belgium had ended. The new nation looked forward to a future of peace and prosperity as it began to set up its own government and handle its own rich and vast natural resources. Fast forward 49 years. The Democratic Republic of Congo is front page news all over the world. Why? Because there’s fighting going on in Goma. Yet more people have been killed, adding to the 5.4 million that have died as a result of war in the Congo over the past decade, not to mention the hundreds of thousands that were killed and tortured under Mobutu’s 32 year dictatorship. The breakout in Goma is now threatening to shatter the weak but hopeful peace in the Congo. What happened to the peace and prosperity that the Congolese looked forward to so expectantly in 1960? How is it that their own government left the Congolese as destitute and hopeless as they had been under Belgium? Why is it that neither the tortures nor the horrors nor the injustice ceased? I propose to do my honor’s project on the political history of the Congo from when it gained its independence in 1960 until the present. I intend to discuss such political figures as Lumumba, Kabila, Mobutu and his regime, and the causes of the civil war that began in 1997 and devastated so many lives. I also want to discuss the situation that is going on in Goma. Finally, I would like to discuss some of the solutions offered by political scientists on what the Congo needs to do in order to finally make the dream of peace and prosperity a reality.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Development of Bioluminescent Mammary Cancer Cells with Knocked Down Expression of OSM for Detection of Bone Metastasis &#60;em&#62;in Vivo&#60;/em&#62;</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sutherland, Caleb</dc:creator>

<dc:description>Oncostatin M (OSM) is a multifunctional cytokine belonging to the interleukin (IL)-6 subfamily. OSM was originally recognized by its ability to decrease breast and other tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Based on data from our lab, we hypothesize that OSM is a mediator of breast cancer metastasis to bone. For our model system, we are utilizing two cell lines, 4T1.2 and 66c14, which were derived from the mammary carcinoma of a Balb/c mouse. 4T1.2 cells express medium levels of OSM and are highly metastatic to bone, lymph nodes, and lungs when injected into the mammary fat pad of Balb/c mice. 66c14 cells express low levels of OSM and demonstrate low levels of metastasis that is restricted to the lymph nodes and lungs. A small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to OSM was designed and stably transfected into the cells in order to decrease or ‘knock down’ OSM expression. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify levels of secreted OSM protein in both cell lines and confirm knocked down OSM expression. Normal 4T1.2 and 66c14 cells, as well as knockdown 4T1.2 and 66c14 cells, will be injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c mice. To visualize metastasis to bone in vivo, the cell lines are currently being transfected with pGL4, a vector containing a bioluminescence maker called luciferase. The luciferase gene was isolated from the firefly and encodes an enzyme, which along with its substrate luciferin, can be used to image the cells expressing luciferase in vivo. Our aim is to determine whether tumor cell-produced OSM is necessary for breast cancer metastasis to bone by measuring metastasis in cells that have knocked down expression of OSM. If our results confirm our hypothesis, inhibiting OSM and its signaling may be a new target for treating breast cancer metastasis to bone.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Energy Balance Modeling in the Snake River Basin</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Khanal, Manogya</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Hoekema, David</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Partitioning of the energy balance components into net radiation, latent, sensible and ground heat fluxes is useful for quantifying water and energy fluxes which in turn is valuable for the water management studies. However, it is difficult to measure or model these components over vast areas continuously. The Snake River basin is a heavily managed system where quantification of the primary sink component of the energy balance, evapotranspiration or latent heat flux, will provide first-hand information on the demand side of the water budget. In this study, we will process and present the seasonality and interannual variability in the weather variables collected from AgriMet stations operated and maintained by Bureau of Reclamation from three stations, namely Malta, Rupert and Twin Falls, located in the Snake River Basin for a two year period, 2006- 07. The variables that will be analyzed include air temperature, solar radiation, precipitation, relative humidity and wind speed for the period between 2004 and 2007. This study will quantify the energy balance fluxes using these weather variables and verify them with a land surface model and available remote-sensing-based energy balance estimates.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Sacrificios Para La Familia: The Context of Mexican Farm Worker Narratives.</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Valderrama, Carolina</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Among the school age population in Idaho, the populations most at risk for not graduating and/or dropping out from high school are the children of migrant farm workers. According to data from the 2000 CPS, the dropout rate is 44.2% for Hispanics 16 through 24 who are born outside the United States. Previous research has focused on several contributing factors to the drop out rate such as, socioeconomic status, recent immigration, and linguistic differences, few studies however, have focused on the role of generational context as a possible factor. This study explores the role of generation as a factor influencing the drop out rate of migrant farm working children. It draws on narratives and life history accounts from 22 interviews of migrant workers, a project from the Hispanic Oral History Project conducted in 1991 for the Idaho State Historical Society. It concludes that the dropout rate among farm workers should be seen more accurately as a conflict between the collectivist cultural orientations of Latino farm worker students that clash with an educational system that emphasizes individual competition over cooperation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Regulation of Cyclin E Turnover by the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Galligar, Billy</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Lamb, Cheri</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a cytosolic, ligand-activated receptor that mediates the toxicity of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, including the potent environmental pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Many of the toxic effects associated with TCDD exposure stem from aberrant cellular proliferation, yet the mechanism remains unclear. In a mouse model of liver regeneration induced by surgical partial hepatectomy, exposure to TCDD elicits a G1 cell cycle arrest in regenerating hepatocytes. This arrest coincides with decreased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), which phosphorylates the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and facilitates passage to S-phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, exposure to TCDD reduced the amount of CDK2-bound cyclin E, which is a positive regulator of CDK2 activity. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that diminished levels of cyclin E in TCDD-treated mice are due to enhanced ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of cyclin E protein. Mice were treated with 20 ug/kg TCDD or peanut oil control 24 hours prior to surgical removal of 70% of the liver. Mice were euthanized and livers were collected 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 96 hours post-surgery. Livers were homogenized, immunoprecipitated with an anti-cyclin E antibody, and probed for ubiquitin by western blot. Whereas results from initial experiments proved inconclusive, additional studies are in progress using a modified protocol to detect ubiquitination. Enhanced ubiquitination of cyclin E in liver homogenates from TCDD-treated mice would support the hypothesis that TCDD increases cyclin E protein degradation in vivo. This would direct future studies toward examining mechanisms by which exposure to TCDD influences the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway during cell cycle progression.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>The Effects of Trauma, Dissociation and Gender on Emotion Regulation</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Clifford, Sierra</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Grover, Tess</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Silveira, Nik</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Individuals faced with traumatic experiences may develop strategies to minimize or avoid powerful negative emotions. Such strategies might involve more focus on control and monitoring, or detaching from emotional events. Psychology 101 students completed a variety of self-report measures of emotion regulation, as well as measures of trauma and dissociation. The first hypothesis was that trauma would be correlated with increased use of thought control, while dissociation would be correlated with strategies emphasizing emotional control, emotional avoidance, and distraction. The second hypothesis was that men would rely more on these emotional avoidance strategies than women, which could imply gender differences in coping with trauma.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Global climate change has drawn the attention of the public and professionals, alike, due to a host of human health and environmental implications. Researchers have studied, and continue to study, a wide variety of environmental implications, including effects on ecosystems and biodiversity, sea level rise, agriculture, and precipitation. How microbial life on earth is affected by global climate change is not well understood. The following research proposal represents an attempt to better understand the affects of global climate change, particularly precipitation changes, on microbial diversity. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has maintained soil plots of variable soil types, precipitation conditions, and vegetation cover for more than 15 years. We sampled a subset of these plots that encompassed three different precipitation regimes (ambient, 2X summer, and 2X fall/spring), across two different plant communities (native sagebrush mix consisting of a variety of shrubs, grasses, and forbs and crested wheat grass monoculture), and at two different depths, 15-20 cm and 95-100 cm deep, all within the same soil type. Replicate samples were obtained from separate plots for each treatment to ensure sampling was representative of the microbial life present. We are utilizing terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (TRFLP) to analyze the soil microbial community composition to obtain insight into how global climate change, particularly altered precipitation patterns, impacts microbial diversity and plant-microbe interactions. This work is on-going and we expect to observe significant precipitation treatment effects in the shallow (i.e. 15-20 cm) samples and differences with respect to plant community type. These data will be evaluated along with a suite of other measures to assess how long-term alteration in precipitation patterns affects soil microbial community structure and function.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Purification of Novel Shiga Toxin Based Vaccine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Pollard, Herbert</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Many parts of the world go without effective vaccination programs because they lack the medical infrastructure to provide sterile environments for intravenous administration of vaccines. The construction and development of stable oral vaccines would greatly increase vaccination rates in parts of the world where sterile environments are not available, and would also represent a significant improvement in developed countries. However, mucosal vaccines require the presence of a “helper” substance, or adjuvant. The protein toxins expressed by a number of gram negative bacteria, including Shiga toxin (Stx) produced by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) represent promising mucosal vaccine adjuvants. The purpose of this experiment is to purify a detoxified derivative of Shiga toxin that is a fusion, or chimera, of the toxin with a vaccine antigen of interest. These experiments have focused on the successful cloning of a 6x histidine tag to a plasmid containing the genes for the Stx A2/B genes. This construct will allow for rapid purification of novel toxin chimeras on nickel columns. We have used molecular techniques to successfully insert a 6x His tag into the Stx plasmid. The LcrV antigen from Yersinia pestis as well as a red fluorescent protein (RFP) will be cloned into this novel expression vector, creating chimeras of the StxA2/B subunits that can be purified using the 6x His tag and characterized as potential oral vaccines.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Primary and Secondary Dormancy in &#60;em&#62;Lomatium Dissectum&#60;/em&#62; Seeds</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Donahue, Jacklyn</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Perez, Michelle</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Lomatium Dissectum (Apiaceae) is a perennial, herbaceous plant of wide distribution in Western North America. At the time of dispersal, L. dissectum seeds are dormant and have underdeveloped embryos. We investigated the environmental requirements for dormancy break and embryo growth. The embryos elongated between five and seven fold inside the seeds over several weeks of cold stratification. Embryo growth prior to and during germination occurred at temperatures between 3 and 6°C and was negligible at stratification temperatures of 0.5 and 9.1°C. Comparison of the cold stratification requirements of different seed populations indicates that seeds collected from moist habitats have longer cold stratification requirements than those from semiarid environments. Interruption of the cold stratification period by eight weeks of dehydration decreased seed viability by about 30% and induced secondary dormancy in the remaining seeds. The requirements for dormancy break and germination reflect an adaptation to trigger germination in late winter.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Friendship Quality and Interparental Conflict as Predictors of Relationship Status</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Phillips, Andrea</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In order to fulfill the requirements of a psychology research methods course in the 2008 fall semester, I designed and implemented a survey-style study. This study examined the importance of friendship quality, parental marital status, and interparental conflict on young adult romantic relationships. Eighty-three general psychology students took surveys about current relationship status, friendship quality, and observed interparental conflict. Results show that there is a strong correlation between friendship quality and the length of participants’ relationships. There is also a significant difference between males and females regarding how often they talk to their friends. There is a significant negative correlation between talking to friends and how often participants fight with their partners. Results also indicate that participants who report experiencing more interparental conflict growing up are likely to fight more often in their current relationships than those participants who reported relatively less interparental conflict. The implications for parents understanding the impact of their own conflict on the later relationships of their children are discussed.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Influence of Biological Soil Crust and Litter on &#60;em&#62;Bromus Tectorum&#60;/em&#62; Establishment Under Natural Conditions</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Osgood, Tyler</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Previous experiments under growth chamber conditions indicated that a biological soil crust dominated by the moss Bryum argenteum decreased the establishment of the invasive weed Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass). We are presently studying whether a similar phenomenon occurs in a natural setting. For this purpose, we prepared trays with bare soil and soil covered with biological soil and distributed B. tectorum seeds over these surfaces. Furthermore, we covered half of the trays with B. tectorum litter to investigate the effect of the litter on seed germination and on the photosynthetic performance of the biological soil crust. The trays were placed at the Idaho Botanical Gardens during the summer of 2008. Shoot biomass of B. tectorum and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the biological soil crust were determined on samples collected on October 2008 and February 2009. Shoot biomass was about half on biological soil crust than on bare soil. In contrast, the presence of litter led to an increase in the biomass of B. tectorum. For the samples collected on October 2008, the Fv/Fm ratio of the crust determined by chlorophyll fluorescence was not affected by the presence of litter. However, prolonged exposure to litter lowered the photosynthetic efficiency of the crust. On February of 2009, the average Fv/Fm values of crust covered with litter and control crust were 0.36 and 0.76, respectively. We plan to make more measurements on May and July 2009 to ascertain the results observed and to analyze the effects of the treatments on the yield of B. tectorum seeds.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>President’s Writing Awards</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Boise State University</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Winning students will read sections of their entries.
The President’s Writing Awards is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary of recognizing excellence in student writing. During this time, the contest has awarded prizes for a diverse selection of student essays in a number of different categories. The contest is funded by the President’s office and submissions are encouraged from academic departments across the curriculum. Categories are carefully chosen each year to include many types of academic writing, including critical analysis, research reporting, and creative nonfiction. We have also had specialized categories sponsored by various departments including Spanish, Business, and Education. This year we added a new category specifically for writing in Science, Math, and Engineering, and we are commemorating the twentyfifth anniversary by publishing an anthology that highlights some of the best winning essays available, including several of those chosen for this year’s awards. Ultimately, the contest gives students a chance to highlight the work, both creative and research-based, that they have produced during their academic careers.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Variable Gain Amplifiers Using Chalcogenide-Based Variable Resistors</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Betre, Hiwot Kassaye</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Cobbley, Stephanie</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A variable gain amplifier traditionally uses discrete component variable resistors, (e.g., potentiometer), on the output of a fixed gain operational amplifier circuit to control the gain. In class AB amplifiers the volume can be adjusted by varying this resistance, but due to the noise level in the output, the quality of the sound and efficiency of the amplifier is low. Chalcogenide based variable resistance devices are integrated circuit devices that have a wide variety of potential applications due to their low power consumption, ability to withstand radiation in harsh environments, high digital capacity, that is, the ability to retrieve data, and scaling. Due to these properties they have potential application in many consumer products (e.g., cell phones, computers, digital recorders), national defense, health and medicine, outer space, weather forecasting and so on. In our project, chalcogenide variable resistors (CVRs) are used to control the gain of a simple amplifier. These resistors are independently programmable. The advantage of the CVR in a circuit such as this variable gain amplifier is that the resistor can be fabricated in with the integrated circuit, thus creating a much smaller, lower power, and lower noise amplifier.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Policy Implementation: Focusing on Idaho Legislation Regarding the Sale of Pseudoephedrine</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Henry, Kate</dc:creator>
<dc:description>What happens to a piece of legislation that has battled its way through committee and finally gets passed? Some make a huge difference. Some have an impact through the change of one word. The rest are forgotten as shelf after shelf of legislation is not being enforced. Implementation is often left to the discretion of an end agency and may not be given enough attention. More focus may rest on the fiscal impact and what the major parties think about the premise behind the legislation. The six step policy process is a way to evaluate the success of specific legislation. After defining the issue, can a piece of legislation actually fix the outlined problem? Through support for the solution and implementation, the feedback loop allows the observer to see if the problem has been adequately addressed. In Idaho, the issue of selling pseudoephedrine is one that affects many individuals due to its use in making methamphetamine, unfortunately prevalent in Idaho. The sale of pseudoephedrine was addressed in a piece of legislation during both the 2005 and 2006 Idaho legislative sessions. This research project follows the path of the pseudoephedrine legislation through the six step process with particular attention to problem definition and implementation. Have the agencies been enforcing this piece of legislation? What has the impact of this legislation been? What has changed for individual pharmacies since the issue was initially raised? Although much scholarly research has been done on implementing legislation, this project employs B. Guy Peters as a foundation to considering local implementation of this state-level policy.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of TCDD on Proliferation of the UMR-106 Osteoblast Cell Line</dc:title>
<dc:creator>DIngillo, Shawna</dc:creator>
<dc:description>2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an environmental toxicant that is produced as a byproduct of chemical manufacturing processes and the incineration of medical and municipal waste. TCDD exerts toxicity by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is a soluble, ligand activated transcription factor. Recent studies indicate that AhR activation modulates cell cycle progression in numerous cell types, including primary osteoblast cultures. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it is proposed that AhR activation alters gene transcription that leads to increased expression of p27Kip1, a protein that suppresses proliferation by inhibiting progression to S-phase of the cell cycle. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to TCDD suppresses proliferation of the rat osteosarcoma cell line, UMR-106, through upregulation of p27Kip1 protein. UMR-106 cells were plated and serumstarved for 24 hr to synchronize cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Cells were then serum-released in the presence of 6 nM TCDD or DMSO control. Cells were collected after 24, 48, and 72 hours. Protein expression was analyzed by western blot, and cell viability was evaluated by alamar blue staining. Results indicate that neither proliferation nor p27Kip1 protein expression was altered by exposure to TCDD. This study suggests that the proliferation of this immortalized osteoblast cell line is not affected by TCDD. Moreover, the use of UMR-106 cells does not appear to be a suitable model system for studying mechanisms of AhR-mediated cell cycle control.</dc:description>

<dc:description>El cuerpo humano es la fotografía de la brutalidad que se vive en un régimen opresor, inhumano y violento. La descripción del cuerpo humano en un testimonio confirma los acontecimientos de violencia que han dejado huella en los cuerpos de miles y quitado la vida a muchos más. A través del análisis de las obras de Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia de Elizabeth Burgos y The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival de Alicia Partnoy, se estudia el uso de la descripción del cuerpo humano como representación gráfica y evidencia física en la narración de la literatura testimonial.
The body as a Testimonio in Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia by Elizabeth Burgos and The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival by Alicia Partnoy
The description of the human body in testimonial literature portrays and corroborates the violent events that have marked and scarred the lives of subordinated communities in Latin America. The human body is a photograph of the brutality that people experience under an oppressive, inhumane and violent regime. Through the analysis of Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia by Elizabeth Burgos and Alicia Partnoy’s The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival, this essay explores the descriptions of the human body within the narrative as a graphic representation and physical evidence of testimonial literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA) have been adopted as a solution to deliver reliable energy from renewable sources with realtime management and monitoring without constant on-site supervision from personnel. SCADA systems provide power system automation of data collection, data logging, alarm monitoring and system control, while maintaining the ability of human control through networked equipment. We will provide a SCADA solution comprising of the design and testing of an integrated network. The network will continually monitor and provide control to off-site networks for all aspects of a wind farm comprised of fifty-six wind turbines that supply eighty-one megawatts of clean renewable energy to a utility power grid. Research of the best available modern microprocessor-based system components has been performed and specification of desired equipment has been submitted. Through research and analysis of donated industry equipment we will complete all configurations of the necessary components. The configuration of these components will be performed to allow automation of monitoring and data logging. Human control will be provided through a Human- Machine Interface (HMI), an interactive computer application that allows a human operator real-time monitoring and control. Once the configuration of the components is complete we will build the network and design testing procedures to ensure all applications perform as described. At the completion of all testing we will construct a procedural document providing complete step-by-step installation and field testing that will be used in commissioning the SCADA system in a field application.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Attachment Style and Pet Bonds</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hutchinson, Cory</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The purpose of the present study is to examine the relation between a person’s attachment style and their relationship with their pet. Attachment Theory suggests that how an individual attaches to one or both parents in childhood can become the working model for future adult relationships. Arguing that the human-animal relationship is an adult relationship and applying Attachment Theory to the human-pet relationship, this study begins this important work by determining if there is a correlation between adult attachment style and how humans tend to relate to companion animals. Data collection is currently underway; the study will ultimately have 400 undergraduate participants from Boise State University. Data were collected anonymously using the Qualtrics survey software program. The surveys used were the Lexington Attachment to Pet Scale, Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, and the Childhood Pet Ownership Questionnaire. These questionnaires had been previously tested and were combined in a survey that took approximately 30 minutes to complete. Results will include an analysis of mother-child attachment as it relates to attachment to pets as well as father-child attachment as it relates to attachment to pets.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The process of scanning inherently introduces degradations to an image. These degradations affect the overall quality of the scanned image. Models have been derived to characterize the image degradations created by the optical system in a scanner. These models can be used to create the synthetic images. If the models accurately reflect the process of the scanner, the output of the model should match real scans. Through statistical analysis of these images, the models can be validated for accuracy. Experiments are conducted to compare the similarity of the real and synthetic images. These images are compared using several difference metrics: Hamming distance, moment features, and RST-invariant moment features, and several image description features.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Surface Acoustic Wave Device Fabrication Using Zinc Oxide and Chalcogenide Thin Films</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Kassaye, Hiwot</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices were fabricated on Si to demonstrate functionality. Device design was laid out and masks produced for fabrication on 100 mm wafers. Device configurations to be made include zinc oxide or chalcogenide piezoelectric thin film (PTF) on interdigitated (IDT) transducers on Si (PTF/IDT/Si), and the alternate IDT/PTF/Si. Initial devices used zinc oxide PTF Rf-magnetron sputter deposited on the IDT transducers for the PTF/IDT/ Si configuration, and simultaneously on Si wafers for subsequent tungsten deposition and etching to produce the IDT/PTF/Si configuration. The devices will be electrically tested for detection of the propagated signal through the piezoelectric film. A second phase of the project will involve post-processing of CMOS chips to deposit piezoelectric thin films to produce smaller scale SAW devices.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Transition After High School: Should Everyone Be Encouraged To Go To College?</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ross, Jennifer</dc:creator>
<dc:description>This study examines the motivating factors and demographics for students pursuing a postsecondary education. College was once thought to be only for people of a particular social class or those with college-educated parents. The current expectation is all students, even those with low academic achievement, are expected to go to college. Ninety-five percent of high school graduates are college-bound, yet less than one-third have a bachelor’s degree or higher by age 30 to 34 according to James E. Rosenbaum, author of the book Beyond College for All: Career Paths for the Forgotten Half. The data presented in this article was collected from surveys completed by 74 general psychology students at Boise State University. The results indicate that college students are not necessarily from a high or middle socioeconomic status. Adolescents are more likely than their parents to enroll and attend college, regardless of their parents’ education level. According to research from Jacquelynne Eccles, Mina N. Vida, and Bonnie Barber, students enrolled full-time at age 20 were from families with higher incomes and whose mothers were more educated. My data contradicts this finding because parental education levels had no influence as to whether the adolescent Boise State University</dc:description>

<dc:description>El testimonio, como género en la literatura latinoamericana, es muy único. El punto de vista del autor es distinto ya que se deriva del sufrimiento vivido directamente por el testigo. Lo que hace especial al testimonio es la razón principal por la cual se escribe. El testimonio es un acto político que se basa en la fuerza del espíritu de un autor o autora para sobrevivir. El proceso de pensamiento muy único al testigo pues es lo que le ayuda a sobrevivir la tortura física y psicológica. El escribir acerca de este proceso es una característica sobresaliente del testimonio. The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival de Alicia Partnoy provee un ejemplo útil del testimonio con el que se puede analizar tal género literario. A través de la obra de Partnoy, este trabajo de investigación identifica las características de la autora como superviviente y explica su urgencia por escribir un testimonio.
An Analysis of the Testimonio in Alicia Partnoy’s The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival
The testimonio, as a genre of Latin American literature, is very unique. The point of view of the author is distinct because it is derived from the suffering experienced directly by the writer. What makes a testimonio special is the principal reason for which it is written. A testimonio is rooted in the need for authors to make themselves heard. It is a political act based on survival of the spirit. The thought processes which help the author-witness to survive government-sponsored physical and psychological torture are a strong characteristic of a testimonio. The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival, by Alicia Partnoy, provides a useful example of testimony with which to analyze the genre. Using Partnoy’s work, this research paper identifies the characteristics of the author as a survivor and discusses her urgency for writing a testimonio.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Riding the Dragon: Argentina, Brazil and the Chinese Commodity Market</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Diaz, Nicolas</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Latin America has abundant supplies of many highly demanded raw materials. The presence of these natural resources provides a great opportunity for the continent to become self reliant and, potentially, a major power in the world economy. With the rise of China’s economic power in the past two decades, there is now a substantial trading relationship between Latin America and China. This connection can be analyzed by looking at the MERCOSUR, focusing on its two leading economies, Brazil and Argentina. How is Latin America being affected by Chinese investment? The following article will examine the economic impact the rise of China has had on Latin America. To narrow the scope of analysis, this article will focus on how agricultural production and exports to China have changed in Brazil and Argentina since 1996. The production and sale of soy and beef of these South American nations can be traced to the increasing demand in China. The purpose of the article is to show how these new economic relationships are transforming agricultural sectors in Brazil and Argentina. An independent variable that may affect this relationship is the industrialization and globalization process the Chinese market is experiencing. With the new trading opportunities, Brazil and Argentina may now have the chance to develop their society and improve their political and economic performance.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Counting Walks From Distinct Vertices on Directed and Undirected Graphs</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chown, Justin</dc:creator>
<dc:description>In this talk we will explore the idea of counting subgraphs with special properties of a given graph. The subgraphs we will focus on are trees with specified leaves, and we will look into algorithms well understood in the literature, as well as some we will build, to convert the trees of our interest into algebraic objects like sequences. In the case of only two leaves we study simple paths between two given vertices. We will then be able to distinguish particular patterns in the Adjacency Matrix, and other useful matrices, given from the graphs we study, which will allow us to produce counting procedures, similar to the Matrix Tree Theorem, to count the trees we are interested in. First we will look into undirected graphs and use Prufer’s method as a guide to developing our own method for assigning the trees of our interest to sequences that are special to them. Next, we will use the Matrix Tree Theorem as a guide to develop a counting scheme to determine the number of trees of our interest that exist in a connected and undirected graph. Lastly we will expand our research to directed graphs, counting trees with our desired properties in those graphs. Applications of this research include but are not limited to determining the number of different driving directions a GPS navigator can use to guide drivers to their destinations, and with the use of weighting functions give optimizations for fuel economy, driving time, distance, et cetera. If time allows we will explore the effect of these weighting functions and use Kruskal’s Algorithm as a guide to determining the optimal walk along our trees in the newly weighted graphs.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Barroso, Maria</dc:creator>
<dc:description>El testimonio de Rigoberta Menchú, en Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia de Elizabeth Burgos, retrata la lucha de supervivencia de los pueblos indígenas en Guatemala. Menchú describe con franqueza cómo la tortura y la opresión, que los grupos indígenas enfrentaron durante la guerra civil en Guatemala, resultó en silenciar sus voces y en un temor de luchar por sus derechos humanos. Esta unidad entre los miembros indígenas de la comunidad de Guatemala, es claramente una herramienta esencial para su supervivencia, se demuestra en Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia. Este trabajo examina cómo se crea la unidad entre las comunidades indígenas con el fin de avanzar en una época de tortura y sufrimiento, y de cómo la solidaridad es esencial para la supervivencia de grupos indígenas en Guatemala.
The Representation of Solidarity in Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia
The testimonio of Rigoberta Menchú, as told to Elizabeth Burgos, in Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia, portrays the struggle of survival of the indigenous people in Guatemala. Menchú describes candidly how torture and oppression that indigenous groups faced during the civil war in Guatemala resulted in silencing their voices and fearing to fight for their human rights. This unity between the indigenous members of the community of Guatemala, which is clearly an essential tool for their survival, is evidently demonstrated in Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia. This paper examines the role in which unity is created, between indigenous communities in order to advance during a time of torture and hardship, and how solidarity is essential for the group’s survival in Guatemala.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stress plays a large part of college life. To understand the reasons for stress, this study examined aspects that either decrease or increase the frequency of stress in Psychology 101 students. The study demonstrated that the frequency of stress responses was lower as students actively deal with stressful thoughts. This meant that a negative correlation was found between the Metacognitions Questionnaire - which measured the frequency of stress responses, and the Thought Control Questionnaire - which measured individuals “ways of dealing with stressful thoughts.” A positive correlation was found between the experienced trauma and the frequency of stress responses in students’ lives. The Impact of Events Scale measured frequency of stress responses while the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey measured the amount traumatic events.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Initial Investigations into the Synthesis and Elect rochemical Polymerization of Thiophene- Based Molecular-Imprinted Polymers for use as Benzene Sensor Electrodes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Young, Lisa</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Benzene is a toxic and carcinogenic environmental pollutant that is a common product of industrial waste. Possible chemical sensors for such contaminants include molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs). These are formed by the electropolymerization of monomers onto a metal surface, creating shape- and electrostatic-specific chemical pockets that attract the molecule of interest. When an electric potential is applied to the MIP in the presence of that molecule, a current is induced that correlates to pollutant concentration. The goal of this project is to synthesize and optimize an MIP that can detect and quantify benzene in natural samples. Various thiophene-based monomers containing a benzene template are being or have been synthesized, each corresponding to a separate future MIP that will differ in terms of conjugation and the size and electrostatic characteristics of the binding site. The sensitivity/selectivity of these MIPs will determine the best monomer and, ultimately, the optimal sensor design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objective of our project is to aid in reducing Boise State’s carbon footprint by reducing the amount of cars on the road and their associated carbon emissions. To achieve this goal we are researching and developing strategies that could increase bicycle use on the Boise State campus and in the Treasure Valley. We are proposing the implementation of a few programs that will increase bicycle use including; a bike sharing program (bike library), reorganizing bike pathways, and increasing public education. The organization of our research is divided into five general topics: public opinion, funding issues, infrastructure issues, staffing for the bike library, and public outreach. This project is a capstone for the Environmental Studies seniors, in which students from various academic backgrounds have conglomerated to construct a real life proposal demonstrating teamwork towards a rewarding goal. The purpose of this project is process-oriented integration of student cooperation and a base of knowledge obtained through course work at Boise State.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Evaluation of a Weldable Zipper System for AIRE/Outcast Boats Inc.</dc:title>

<dc:description>AIRE/Outcast Boats, Inc., located in Meridian, ID, manufactures high quality inflatable watercraft used for industrial, government, and sporting purposes. The watercraft shells are made of a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coated 1670 denier polyester base fabric. As part of the assembly process, AIRE uses a polymer thermal welding process to create stitchless PVC – PVC seams capable of withstanding pressures in excess of 500 psi. To allow access to the interior air cells, the final closure consists of two #10 zippers stitched in tandem, then double stitched to the body of the watercraft. Stitching the closing zipper system is a time and labor intensive step in the manufacturing process. AIRE would like to explore the concept of a thermally weldable zipper to improve manufacturing speed and efficiency. The objective of our Senior Design project is to research and test various means of thermally welding a single #20 zipper as the closing mechanism for AIRE rafts. Options evaluated were: 1) implementing a coating process that can be applied to existing zippers, 2) finding a company that is capable of supplying a coating, or 3) coiling a zipper directly to the PVC material in-house. This poster presents the most promising solution based on results of mechanical testing, effectiveness of method, and processing efficiency.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Field Portable Sensor for Direct Detection of Mercury in Aqueous Media and in Crude Oil</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hecket, Meagan</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Field portable sensors are of increasing interest for a number of applications. We report an electrochemical sensor based on a semi conductive polymer derivatized to have selective binding sites for mercury. Covalent attachment of 1, 4, 10-trioxa-7, 13-diaza-cyclopentadecane, a  ligand with high affinity for mercury, promotes coordination of mercury on the sensor surface thus preconcentrating it prior to detection by its redox signature. This sensor gives real time mercury concentrations with low detection limits and high selectivity. A detection limit of 10 parts per trillion with a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude has been demonstrated for aqueous mercury using this method. Preliminary results for direct detection of mercury in crude oil and in gas phase emissions will be reported.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Improving Anthracycline Therapy Through Carbonyl Reductase Inhibition</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Loome, William</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Human Carbonyl Reductase (HCBR) is an enzyme responsible for converting a chemotherapeutic class of drugs known as anthracyclines into cardiotoxic metabolites while simultaneously reducing their chemotherapeutic efficacy. My research goal is to identify inhibitors of HCBR that may be of pharmacologic value by maintaining the chemotherapeutic properties of these drugs while reducing their cardiotoxicity; outcomes that may lead to dosage reductions during chemotherapy. The methodology involves evaluating chemical compounds for HCBR inhibition potential using a standard assay containing Menadione, NADPH, and HCBR in a phosphate buffer. All test experiments use UV spectrophotometry to determine reaction activity compared against controls. One HCBR inhibitor was identified which initially appeared promising particularly because of its appealing molecular structure that suggested it may be well received in humans. Subsequent IC-50 studies to determine effective inhibitory concentrations revealed questionable pharmacologic value. My research will continue to test other chemical compounds for possible HCBR inhibition. My research endeavors have provided a wonderful outlet for my curiosity and have helped solidify my understanding of bench research and its contribution in the learning process of disease and biological systems.

			<dc:title>Bithionol Sulfone as Potential Carbonyl Reductase Inhibitor</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Grange, Landon</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Carbonyl reductase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide range of carbonyls. CR has been connected to several important processes including quinone detoxification, neuroprotection, prostaglandin metabolism, and anthracycline metabolism. CR reduction of anthracyclines negatively impacts their use in the treatment of cancer in two important ways: drug resistance and cardiotoxicity. Inhibition of CR in conjunction with anthracycline therapy offers the potential to increase the effectiveness of the drugs at lower doses, and to decrease the risk of cardiotoxicity. The goal is to better understand how CR recognizes the molecules to which it binds, be they substrates or inhibitors. With this information, drugs could be designed to control CR with the intention of reducing the risk of cardiotoxicity during anthracycline cancer treatment. Also, as the role of CR is better understood, it may have applications to other drug pathways as well. Currently the lab is testing out analogs of 4-benzoyl pyridine as potential carbonyl reductase inhibitors. The objective is to synthesize bithionol sulfone and then test this compound as a CR inhibitor. The results will further define the binding properties of the enzyme as well as investige new classes of molecules that potentially can serve as inhibitors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The self-assembly properties and small size of DNA suggests that it is an ideal candidate for bottom-up fabrication of nanoscale structures. DNA origami is synthesized when a single strand of DNA is folded and “stapled” into a desired shape via short DNA strands, known as staple strands. One challenge of using DNA as a nanometer scale building material is the controlled positioning of DNA on a substrate. Dielectrophoresis is a method for positioning a polarizable particle in a nonuniform electric field. It has been used to manipulate DNA in specific locations onto a substrate with electron-beam fabricated electrodes.[1]  We present ongoing work in which electrodes are being fabricated by a combination of shadow-masked physical vapor deposition (PVD) and electron-beam lithography (EBL) processes. Chromium/gold electrodes are deposited on a silicon wafer through a ceramic shadow mask using PVD. PMMA, an electron-sensitive polymer, is spun-on over the electrodes followed by another deposition of chromium to create a circular electrode on the surface of the PMMA. This electrode is the field forming electrode for the dielectrophoresis process. Finally, EBL is performed to expose small windows over the sites for DNA origami trapping.

			<dc:title>Development of a Recombinant Protein Expression System for the Homogenious Production of Human Carbonyl Reductase</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Baggs, Eric</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Anthracyclines are a common and potent chemotherapy treatment for cancers of the lung, breast, uterus, and ovaries, as well as lymphomas and leukemias. One of the major side effects of anthracycline treatment however is the cumulative dose dependent cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest this cardiotoxicity is linked to the reduction of the side chain carbonyl found on this molecule. Human carbonyl reductase catalyzes the reduction of the carbonyl side chain of these molecules. This reduction leads to an anthracycline metabolite that has been linked to the development of the cardiotioxicity. Important to the ongoing studies is the development of a readily available source of human carbonyl enzyme. A clone of the gene that encodes for HCBR was used to create a gene construct that when expressed would lead to human carbonyl reductase with a 29 amino acid polyhistidine peptide attached. This poly histidine tail has a strong affinity for Ni2+ and as such provides a convenient means of purification using a single chromatography step. The resulting HCBR isolated by this method showed a decrease in catalytic activity from the native enzyme. It is believed that this interference is caused by the addition of this amino acid tail. The focus of my research currently is the shortening of this amino acid tail to include only a 6 amino acid polyhistidine peptide. It is believed that such a short peptide will not impair enzyme function. (NIH Grant # P20 RR016454)</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Time Dependence of the Synthesis of Dysprosium Nitride Using a Reactive Milling Technique</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Smith, Cole</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Currently oxides, materials such as silicon or aluminum bonded with oxygen, are used for a variety of high temperature processes. Nitrides, similar materials bonded with nitrogen, are stable at much higher temperatures and conduct heat up to ten times more efficiently. Synthesizing nitrides can be difficult; requiring many processing steps and high temperature devices. Materials with high vapor pressures may evaporate and contaminate furnace equipment when subjected to these processing routes. A closed-system, room temperature process for synthesizing such materials was explored by the Advanced Materials Laboratory in the Materials Science and Engineering Department. Dysprosium nitride (DyN) was produced by a reactive milling method. 99.9% pure dysprosium metal flake was milled in a high energy planetary ball mill in a high purity nitrogen atmosphere. The influence of milling time on the extent of the reaction was explored by milling dysprosium metal for various times. Phase analysis was performed using x-ray diffraction techniques. It is demonstrated that phase pure DyN can be produced at near room temperature.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigation of the C10 Electrophilic Site in DNA Interstrand Cross-Linking by Synthetic Aziridinomitosenes</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McInturff, Emma</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>McHail, Katherine</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Mitomycin C (MC), a quinone-containing cancer therapy agent, is biologically active by alkylating DNA. The crosslinks prevent translation and replication, therein destroying cancer cells. While useful for treating cancer, MC’s clinical utility is limited by its high toxicity. Synthetic aziridinomitosenes, compounds structurally similar to MC, have comparable effects on cancer cells, but by an unknown mechanism. A series of aziridinomitosene analogs have been prepared to study role of the potential active sites on the molecule. Previously, significant differences in the efficacy of the aziridinomitosenes have been observed with a subtle addition of a methyl group to the C6 or C7 position. Two more analogs have been synthesized to complete the examination of active sites on the molecule, now with variation at the C10 position. DNA binding studies of these final analogs should contribute insight to the mechanism for crosslink formation.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Effects of Sea Snail Conotoxins on Acetycholine Binding Protein</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Quapp, Daniel</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Acetylcholine binding protein, AChBP, is a model for nicotinic acid receptors involved in intercellular signaling. Many biological agents can disrupt these receptors, including peptide conotoxins used by sea snails to paralyze their prey. To study the effects of these polypeptides and their derivatives on AChBP, AChBP was over expressed in HEK 293 cells, and purified by affinity chromatography. Binding constants of conotoxin based peptides were studied using microcalorimetry to measure the enthalpic change caused by conotoxin binding to AChBP. These studies should help with the development of new treatments for Parkinson’s disease.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Prediction of the Structure of an Unknown Collagen Type IX-Like Protein Using Homologous Computational Chemical Calculations</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hondros, Christopher</dc:creator>
<dc:description>A functional homologue of the NC4 domain of Collagen type IX, referred to as Col11a1NTD, has been isolated and subjected to initial characterization. While a crystal structure of the NC4 domain is available, no such structure is available for Col11a1NTD. In order to determine if Col11a1NTD has a structure similar to that of the NC4 domain, we are using the computational chemical program AMBER to predict the structure of Col11a1NTD via a molecular dynamics calculation. Initial biochemical analysis of Col11a1NTD has predicted a number of amino acids forming two distinct zinc cation binding sites. These two putative binding sites will be evaluated to determine which site most likely represents the true binding site, functional under the physiological conditions of the cell surface. The results of this computational study will serve to refine the predictions from the biochemical studies and allow us to make hypotheses regarding structure and function that can be tested experimentally.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Investigation of the Coenzyme Binding Mechanism of Carbonyl Reductase Using Fluorescence</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Billetz, Konrad</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Carbonyl reductase (CR) is biological enzyme that may play a key role in mediating the cytotoxicity and cardiotoxicity of common anticancer drugs currently being administered. CR’s role in the human body is to reduce carbonyl-containing molecules to their respective alcohol in the presence of the coenzyme NADPH. One such group commonly used in treating cancer is the anthracyclines. Unfortunately, administering anthracyclines to patients is limited due to the cardiotoxic effects of its metabolites once processed by CR. A further understanding of CR could lead to drug development that minimizes the activity of CR thus increasing anthracyclinedependent cytotoxicity and limiting cardiotoxicity. Understanding the kinetic mechanism of CR is essential in this process. While previous research has focused on the kinetic mechanism as a whole, little work has been done to measure enzymecoenzyme binding. Being so, determining the quantitative kinetic mechanism of CR binding NADP is of interest and can be done using a technique involving fluorescence. (NIH Grant # P20 RR016454)</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Exploration of Dynamic Recrystallization in Metals Using the Finite Element Modeling Program OOF2</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lanning, Wade</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is a process of new grain nucleation and grain refinement which occurs in many metals such as aluminum, copper, and nickel when they are deformed to high strains at elevated temperatures. During DRX, new grains preferentially nucleate at triple junctions (TJs) due to a buildup of stress created by the inhibition of the grain boundary sliding (GBS). TJs containing one or more “special” low-energy boundaries are less likely to nucleate new grains, possibly because special boundaries are relatively resistant to GBS. For this project, a novel method of simulating GBS in the OOF2 finite element modeling program was developed. It has shown that GBS will redistribute stresses in a microstructure to varying degrees depending on microstructure geometry and the susceptibility of differing grain boundaries to GBS. This study is primarily a comparison of different finite element models, but it will soon be applied to the analysis of experimentally developed microstructures. This knowledge could help researchers and manufacturers predict microstructural changes that take place in some metals during processing.</dc:description>

			<dc:title>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Study of Twinning in Ni2MnGa</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Ahern, Rebecca</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Ni2MnGa is a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy (FSMA). FSMAs exhibit a shape memory effect which is induced through either the application of a magnetic field or mechanical stress. This shape change is reversible through the rotation of the magnetic field or stress. It has been shown that the mechanism for the shape memory response is twin boundary motion; thus, the shape memory response is dictated by the size and orientation of twins within the material. The purpose of this investigation is to study common twinning modes of Ni2MnGa martensite with the 14M structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples were made using an electrochemical etching process, and lightand dark-field imaging in combination with selected area electron diffraction was used to identify the type and orientation of twin variants and their interfaces.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bacteria isolated from a stream near Moscow, Idaho exhibited unexpected antibiotic resistance, indicating that the water was contaminated with agricultural waste. A plasmid isolated from the bacteria was sequenced and bioinformatic analysis of open reading frames (ORFs) suggested the presence of broad spectrum beta-lactamases, genes conveying antibiotic resistance. These genes of interest are being isolated, amplified, and over expressed to characterize their substrate specificity and activity. The presence of the plasmid may testify to the environmental impact of antibiotic overuse in industries, such as feedlots and fish hatcheries. Outreach presentations to High School students that emphasize the role of human activity on water quality are planned.</dc:description>
