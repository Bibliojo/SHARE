In another embodiment, a method includes acquiring a structure having an ionically-conductive, electrically-resistive electrolyte/separator layer covering an inner or outer surface of a carbon-containing electrically-conductive hollow fiber and a catalyst along one side thereof, adding an anode that extends along at least part of a length of the structure, and adding a cathode that extends along at least part of the length of the structure on an opposite side as the anode.</dc:description><dcq:publisher/><dcq:publisherAvailability/><dcq:publisherResearch>LLNL (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Livermore, CA (United States))</dcq:publisherResearch><dcq:publisherSponsor>USDOE</dcq:publisherSponsor><dcq:publisherCountry>United States</dcq:publisherCountry><dc:date>2014-07-08</dc:date><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>Patent</dc:type><dcq:typeQualifier/><dc:relation/><dc:coverage/><dc:format>Medium: ED</dc:format><dc:identifier>OSTI ID: 1140131, Legacy ID: OSTI ID: 1140131</dc:identifier><dc:identifierReport>8,771,899</dc:identifierReport><dcq:identifierDOEcontract>AC52-07NA27344</dcq:identifierDOEcontract><dc:identifierOther>Other: 12/706,626</dc:identifierOther><dc:doi/><dc:rights>Patent Assignee: Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (Livermore, CA)</dc:rights><dc:dateEntry>2014-07-21</dc:dateEntry><dc:ostiId>1140131</dc:ostiId><dcq:identifier-purl type="text/html">http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1140131</dcq:identifier-purl><dcq:mediaSequence/></record>
