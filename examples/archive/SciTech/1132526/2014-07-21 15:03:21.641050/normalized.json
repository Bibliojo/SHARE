        "description": "This booklet describes the principles of nuclear-reactor space power plants and shows how they will contribute to the exploration and use of space. It compares them with chemical fuels, solar cells, and systems using energy from radioisotopes. The SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) Program, begun in 1955, is described.",
