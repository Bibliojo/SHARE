Recent studies (Thuss-Patience et\n      al, J. Clin. Oncol. 2005) could show that a combination of docetaxel and 5-FU might be\n      similarly effective as ECF. 5-FU and docetaxel +/- cisplatin combinations are investigated\n      by many groups and may be a future reference treatment. Many data suggest that 5-FU infusion\n      can be replaced by oral capecitabine with equal efficacy.\n\n      As docetaxel/5-FU is probably similarly effective as epirubicin/cisplatin/5-FU and a\n      replacement of 5-FU infusion by capecitabine makes the chemotherapy more comfortable for the\n      patient we investigate in this study a chemotherapy of docetaxel and capecitabine as\n      1st-line therapy for metastatic or advanced gastric cancer."

Staging by imaging is performed every 2 cycles.\n\n      After 40 included patients an amendment was done and the starting of chemotherapy has been\n      reduced to further improve tolerability. Starting dose of docetaxel was amended to 60\n      mg/sqm, d1, and starting dose of capecitabine reduced to 800 mg/sqm twice per day, d1-14.\n      The patient number to be included was increased to 70 pts.\n\n      Therapy is continued up to tumor progression to a maximum of 10 cycles. Therapy is stopped\n      in case of severe side effects, tumor progression or withdrawal of consent.\n\n      This investigator initiated study is supported by Hoffmann-La Roche and by Sanofi-Aventis."
