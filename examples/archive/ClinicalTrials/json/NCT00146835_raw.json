The historical cohort will include age-, gender- and area-matched infants from SCKP\n             who received at least one dose of DTaP vaccine co-administered with Prevnar prior to\n             the infant's 9-month birthday and for whom safety follow-up information is available.\n             This cohort will include infants vaccinated between January, 2002 and March, 2003.\n\n          2. The self-control cohort is defined for the study subject as the 20-day\n             post-vaccination period from Day 21 to Day 41 for each infant in the primary cohort\n             (PEDIARIX co-administered with Prevnar as the primary vaccination course).\n\n          3.
