Primary endpoint was global left-ventricular ejection\n      fraction (LVEF) change from baseline to 6 months\u2019 follow-up, as determined by cardiac MRI.\n      Image analyses were done by two investigators blinded for treatment assignment. Analysis was\n      per protocol.\n\n      Global LVEF at baseline (determined 3\u00b75 days [SD 1\u00b75] after PCI) was 51\u00b73 (9\u00b73%) in controls\n      and 50\u00b70 (10\u00b70%) in the bone-marrow cell group (p=0\u00b759). After 6 months, mean global LVEF\n      had increased by 0\u00b77 percentage points in the control group and 6\u00b77 percentage points in the\n      bone-marrow-cell group (P=0\u00b70026).\n\n      Transfer of bone-marrow cells enhanced left-ventricular systolic function primarily in\n      myocardial segments adjacent to the infarcted area. Cell transfer did not increase the risk\n      of adverse clinical events, in-stent restenosis, or proarrhythmic effects."
