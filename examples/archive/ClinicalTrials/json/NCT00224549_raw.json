At the end of this period, an ABPM will be performed:\n           only patients with a mean day time SBP>135 and/or DBP>85 mmHg will be randomized for a\n           further 3 months treatment\n\n        -  Period 2 from week 0 to week 4: patients will be randomized in two groups, the first\n           one receiving spironolactone 25mg and the second one receiving ramipril 5 mg as add-on\n           therapy (on top of the previous tri-therapy).\n\n        -  Period 3 from week 4 to week 8: Patients with BP controlled at week 4 (i.e mean home\n           blood pressure measurement (HBPM) <135/85 mmHg at week 4) remain on the same treatment.\n           For those uncontrolled (i.e. mean HBPM >135/85 mmHg at week 4), furosemide 20 mg will\n           be added in the first group and ramipril will be titrated to 10 mg in the second group\n\n        -  Period 4 from week 8 to week 10: Patients with BP controlled at week 8 (i.e. mean HBPM\n           <135/85 mmHg at week 8) remain on the same treatment. For those uncontrolled (i.e. mean\n           HBPM >135/85 mmHg at week 8), furosemide will be titrated to 40 mg in the first group\n           and bisoprolol 5 mg will be added in the second group.\n\n        -  Period 5 from week 10 to week 12 (end of the study): Patients with BP controlled at\n           week 10 (i.e mean HBPM <135/85 mmHg at week 10) remain on the same treatment. For those\n           uncontrolled (i.e mean HBPM > 135/85 mmHg at week 10), amiloride 5 mg will be added to\n           the previous treatment in the first group and bisoprolol will be titrated to 10 mg in\n           the second group.\n\n      Reasons for treatment discontinuation:\n\n        -  Patient decision\n\n        -  Informed consent withdrawal\n\n        -  SBP>180 mmHg or <100 mmHg (HBPM) whatever the time during the trial\n\n        -  Adverse events related to treatment or not"
