A complete response was defined as having resolution of all symptoms, normalization of serum IgM levels with complete disappearance of IgM paraprotein by immunofixation, and resolution of any adenopathy or splenomegaly. Patients achieving a partial response and a minor response were defined as achieving a more than or equal to 50% and more than or equal to 25% reduction in serum IgM levels, respectively. Patients with stable disease were defined as having less than 25% change in serum IgM levels, in the absence of new or increasing adenopathy or splenomegaly and/or other progressive signs or symptoms of WM. Progressive disease was defined as a greater than 25% increase in serum IgM level occurred from the lowest attained response value or progression of clinically significant disease-related symptom(s).",

Patients achieving a partial response and a minor response were defined as achieving a more than or equal to 50% and more than or equal to 25% reduction in serum IgM levels, respectively. Patients with stable disease were defined as having less than 25% change in serum IgM levels, in the absence of new or increasing adenopathy or splenomegaly and/or other progressive signs or symptoms of WM. Progressive disease was defined as a greater than 25% increase in serum IgM level occurred from the lowest attained response value or progression of clinically significant disease-related symptom(s).",
