The reasons for non-treatment need to be elucidated to properly\n      address these factors. Appropriate evaluation and treatment of HCV is important in providing\n      the optimal care to these persons. It is also important to document and characterize\n      treatment patterns and prescription rates for policy, resource allocation and funding\n      purposes. This study will determine the rates of treatment for HCV monoinfected and HCV-HIV\n      co-infected patients, and determine the reasons for non-treatment. It will also directly\n      compare the two populations to determine if any differences exist in the reasons for\n      non-treatment. This study has implications for patient care, their health outcomes, policy\n      making, funding and resource allocation."

There are approximately 800 patients\n             in the University of Pittsburgh's PACT/PTEU clinic.  Consecutive patients with\n             HCV-HIV co-infection who present to the clinic upon initiation of data gathering\n             would be eligible for participation in this study.  An estimated 500-800 patients are\n             seen at the CLD clinic per year, and consecutive patients enrolled in the CLD HCV\n             registry would be considered eligible for this study. To maintain uniformity and\n             consistency of data, only patients seen by one of the study investigators would be\n             enrolled.  Recruitment would continue till the study has enrolled 100 HCV-HIV\n             coinfected and 200 HCV mono-infected subjects.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  There are no exclusion criteria, except if the patient refuses to participate in the\n             study."
