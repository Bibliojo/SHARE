The\n      recent use of the non-my\u00e9lo-ablative graft (NMA), in which the anti-leukaemia effect rests\n      exclusively on the allogenic effect \"graft-versus-leukaemia\" makes it possible to obtain\n      among patients of more than 55 years in complete reemission (CR), survivals without relapses\n      comparable with the traditional allograft among patients of more than 35 years.  The major\n      interest of NMA graft is to reduce early mortality related to the graft.  This reduction\n      should be all the more significant as the patient is younger, and thus bring to a better\n      survival.  There is not, at the present hour, of prospective comparative study of the two\n      procedures of graft.  Taking into account the results observed after NMA graft among\n      patients of more than 55 years, and taking into account the toxicity of the standard graft\n      between 35 and 55 years, it is essential to now compare the 2 approaches among patients who\n      do not have a counter-indication for one or the other, in the age bracket where the toxicity\n      of the traditional graft is highest."
