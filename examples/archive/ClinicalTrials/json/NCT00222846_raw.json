Determine whether the intervention improves behavioral adherence to the diabetes\n           self-management regimen including: 1.a. dietary adherence, as measured by self-report\n           using dietary recalls and the Nutrient Data System, 1.b. physical activity as measured\n           by the CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire as well as pedometer readings,  and 1.c.\n           adherence to capillary glucose self-monitoring as assessed by the FreeStyle monitor.\n\n        2. . Determine whether the intervention improves clinical outcome measures including: 2.a.\n           glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c), 2.b. weight loss, 2.c. anthropometrics.\n\n        3. . Explore the extent to which self-efficacy is a mediator of adherence.\n\n        4. . Explore the extent to which the effectiveness of the intervention varies with respect\n           to glycemic control and nephrovascular complications at baseline.\n\n        5. . Explore the impact of a variety of covariates (medications, depression, social\n           support, severity of disease, and general health and sociodemographic characteristics,\n           clinic from which they were recruited, health literacy, and trust in research) on the\n           effectiveness of the intervention.\n\n      Hypothesis #1 is that intervention group participants will perform better than attention\n      control group participants on various measures of adherence to the diabetes management\n      regimen.  Primary behavioral adherence variables will be dietary intake, and physical\n      activity. Hypothesis #2 is that intervention group participants will have lower HbA1c levels\n      than attention control group participants.\n\n      The 6-month intervention includes group classes, held weekly during months 1&2, biweekly\n      during months 3&4, and monthly during month 5&6.  Classes focus on building a sense of\n      mastery over the diabetes regimen and features the use of PDA-base dietary self-monitoring.\n      Intervention group participants are compared to an attention care group, that receives\n      monthly contacts. Measurements are made at baseline, 3, and 6 months."
