    "summary": "The Landau-Kolmogorov problem consists of finding the upper bound $M_k$ for\nthe norm of intermediate derivative $|f^{(k)}|$, when the bounds $|f| \\le M_0$\nand $|f^{(n)}| \\le M_n$, for the norms of the function and of its higher\nderivative, are given.\n  Here, we consider the case of a finite interval, and when all the norms are\nthe max-norms. Our interest to that particular case is motivated by the fact\nthat there are good chances to add this case to a short list of\nLandau--Kolmogorov inequalities where a complete solution exists, i.e., a\nsolution that covers all values of $n,k\\in\\N$ (and, for a finite interval, all\nvalues of $\\sigma = M_n/M_0$).\n  The main guideline here is Karlin's conjecture that says that, for all\n$n,k\\in\\N$ and all $\\sigma>0$, the maximum of $|f^{(k)}|$ is attained by a\ncertain Chebyshev or Zolotarev spline. So far, it has been proved only for\nsmall $n \\ge 4$ with all $\\sigma$, and for all $n$ with particular $\\sigma =\n\\sigma_n$. Here, we prove Karlin's conjecture in several further subcases:\n  1) all $n,k\\in\\N$ and all $0 < \\sigma \\le \\sigma_n$\n  2) all $n \\in \\N$, all $\\sigma > 0$, with $k=1,2$\n  3) all $\\sigma > 0$, with $n < 10$ and $0 < k < n$.",
