    "summary": "The space of all normal currents with compact support in a metric space in\nthe sense of Ambrosio and Kirchheim becomes a chain complex. Its homology is\nproved to be naturally isomorphic to the measure homology of Thurston on the\ncategory of all weakly locally Lipschitz contractible metric spaces and all\nlocally Lipschitz maps. The class of weakly locally Lipschitz contractible\nmetric spaces is large, including all finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces of\ncurvature bounded locally from below or all locally CAT spaces.\n  To prove this result, a topology on a space of Lipschitz maps between\narbitrary metric spaces is introduced and its fundamental properties are\ninvestigated. Further, the $C^1$-topology on the space of all $C^1$-maps\nbetween Riemannian manifolds is characterized by our topology.",
